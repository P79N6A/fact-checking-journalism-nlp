Yes, that's what Lloyds is saying. Having pondered for ten months the implications of that colossal provision, the bank has decided that Daniels should lose \u00a3580,000 of his \u00a31.45m bonus for 2010, but can keep the rest. So: how large would the PPI bill have to have been for Daniels to lose the lot? Today's statement did not say. It is clearly welcome news that a bank has finally had the gumption, and a correctly worded contract, to reduce bonuses in light of new information. But investors are owed a better explanation of how the deductions - 40% for Daniels, 25% for four close lieutenants and a token 5% for eight other executives \u2013 were determined. The statement reeks of lawyers' exchanges. Lloyds ut was the entire clawback process driven by legal argy-bargy?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is to claw back at least \u00a31.5m from five former and current executives and eight other senior managers, to penalise them for \u00a33.2bn of losses the bailed-out bank incurred after the bonuses were awarded. The move, which requires former chief executive Eric Daniels to hand back 40% \u2013 or \u00a3580,000\u2013 of his \u00a31.45m bonus, puts pressure on rival banks to take similar action for bonuses they awarded before being forced to make provisions for payment protection insurance. But there was also criticism over the size of the clawbacks \u2013 just 5% in some instances \u2013 and the number of former bankers involved in the clawback which was announced on Monday following protracted negotiations with those involved. Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer body Which? which championed the cause of PPI, said: \"Lloyds customers will think it's absolutely not enough and it raises the question of how many people should be held accountable for \u00a33.2bn of PPI mis-selling losses.\" Lloyd, who had already written to banks to urge them to claw back bonuses, said: \"We expect and hope that the same action will be taken at the other banks involved.\" Four members of Daniels' executive time at the time \u2013 Helen Weir, Truett Tate, Archie Kane and Tim Tookey \u2013 will each have to pay back 25%, which amounts to \u00a3900,000 in total. The remaining eight are having 5% sliced off their undisclosed bonuses for 2010. They include members of the executive committee such as Carol Sergeant, who was chief risk officer, Mark Fisher, group operations director and Angie Risley, group HR director. The bonuses were paid in shares and have not yet been released. A spokesman for shareholder body Pirc said: \"We think it's a very good precedent. It's really good in terms of demonstrating that it can be done. It sets a precedent. What about other banks?\" Lloyds insisted that the bonus pool for 2011 will also be reduced because of the PPI provision. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 which took provisions of \u00a31bn each \u2013 are also taking account of PPI in their 2011 bonus pools. HSBC took a \u00a3280m provision but has not indicated whether PPI will make a dent in its bonuses. Industry sources cautioned these banks might be unlikely to pursue clawback, however. In becoming the first UK bank to reclaim executive bonuses \u2013 a new process implemented by the industry following the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 Lloyds insisted \"its decision is based entirely on the principle of 'accountability' and in no way on culpability or wrong-doing by the individuals concerned\". Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took over as chief executive from Daniels on 1 March last year, ordered the provision immediately \u2013 sending a shockwave through the industry. Other banks were forced to follow suit when Lloyds stopped fighting the process of awarding compensation through the courts. Yet just weeks before, Daniels had bowed out, heralding a return to profitability following the controversial takeover of HBOS during the banking crisis. Weir, who used to run the retail bank and last week was appointed finance director of department store John Lewis, is to take a \u00a3218,000 reduction. Tate, head of the corporate bank who is leaving in the coming months, takes a \u00a3262,500 reduction, and Kane, the former head of the insurance arm, is now \u00a3191,000 worse off. Tookey, who is to face the City on Friday when he announces the extent of Lloyds's losses for 2011, is having a \u00a3236,000 reduction. He is due to go at the end of the month, leaving the bank without a finance director, as a starting date has not be set for George Culmer, who is joining from insurer RSA. The Financial Services Authority, which has been encouraging banks to look for ways to claw back bonuses following the PPI losses, has been \"kept informed throughout the deliberations leading up to the decision\". Tackling the clawback had been top of Horta-Os\u00f3rio's agenda when he returned to work last month, following two months off after he failed to sleep for five consecutive days in October. The \u00a31.45m bonus for Daniels had been deferred into shares in two equal tranches, which he was to receive in March 2013 and March 2014.",

But on the same day the bailed out bank was announcing its efforts to make people accountable, Santander was slapped with a \u00a31.5m fine by the Financial Services Authority for offences that dated back to when Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio was at the helm of the Spanish bank's UK operations. The other members of the UK board of Santander at the time? Antonio Lorenzo, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, and Alison Brittain \u2013 the team that Horta-Os\u00f3rio brought with him to help clean up Lloyds. So, is it a moment when Santander should claw back parts of their bonus payouts for 2010? The problem is that only Brittain was awarded a bonus for that year \u2013 \u00a3500,000 \u2013 which she then forfeited on being lured to Lloyds. Brittain was handed a total of 7.6m shares but these were not all for her performance in 2010. The other three were bought out of their lucrative deals when they were hired by Lloyds. But while Horta-Os\u00f3rio got a large \"golden hello\", none of it was for his 2010 bonus at Santander as he waived his award that year. A stock exchange announcement issued by Lloyds last year shows that Colomb\u00e1s received 541,835 shares to \"compensate for 2010 bonus forfeited\" following his resignation and Lorenzo 770,615 for the same reason. But the FSA fine is small beer in comparison to the provision Santander also took for PPI mis-selling under that executive team's watch: \u00a3538m.",

      "bodyText": "Major banks could become embroiled in another mis-selling scandal after shares in CPP, the embattled credit card insurer, were suspended on the London Stock Exchange after a Financial Services Authority investigation. The regulator has asked the company, whose partners include Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, \"to undertake a review of certain past business sales\" after an FSA investigation last March into the group's sales practices. An FSA statement said: \"The FSA has serious concerns about the manner in which customers were being sold identity theft and card protection policies by the firm \u2026 It is likely that the firm will be required to carry out a past business review of the direct sales it made for both products and, if appropriate, pay redress.\" It is understood that, as part of that process, the FSA has also been talking to CPP's banking partners, who either sold or recommended CPP services. Meanwhile, Paul Stobart, CPP's chief executive, admitted \"we don't know\" when asked if the banks might get dragged into compensation negotiations but added that the company was conducting a charm offensive with them this week. CPP is arguing that the scope of the FSA's suggested review is \"disproportionate\" and threatens \"the viability of the business\". It said in a statement: \"It is likely that any agreed outcome will have a significant adverse financial impact on the group, but until such outcome is determined the group cannot predict the scale or consequences of that impact. Given the uncertainty as to such outcome, CPP is currently unable to assess accurately its financial position and inform the market accordingly and, as such, considers an immediate suspension to be appropriate.\" The company said it expected the shares to remain suspended until it had worked out the financial impact of the FSA's requirements and said this could take \"some time\". The suspension is the latest setback for CPP, which sells insurance packages to protect against a range of problems from identity theft to pest extermination in homes. Last week Barclaycard decided against renewing its contract with the company, having already suspended some sales of CPP products last year. HSBC and Tesco Bank said they stopped offering CPP products to customers last year. After the suspension of its shares on Monday morning, CPP reiterated the potentially dire implications to its business. It said it had \"emphasised the potential threat to a business which employs 1,341 people in the UK\". CPP raised \u00a3150m in a flotation in 2010 when its shares were listed at 235p and made founder Hamish Ogston \u00a3120m. The shares closed at 103p on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Brent crude hit its highest point in eight months on Monday as Iran halted exports to British and French companies ahead of a European Union embargo. Oil prices edged above $121 a barrel. Traders also said that policy developments in China and hopes that Greece's second financial package will be agreed on Monday were helping to push up prices. Over the past month fears of supply disruption in Iran and upbeat economic data from the world's largest oil user, the United States, have helped raise oil prices including Brent, which is sourced from the North Sea. The combination of factors driving demand took the price to $121.15 a barrel during Monday morning trading, a level not seen since mid-June last year. Opec's second largest producer, Iran, stopped oil sales to British and French companies on Sunday, retaliating against tightening EU sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear programme. European oil buyers had already made big cuts in purchases from Iran in recent months ahead of sanctions. While the move is unlikely to have a large effect on UK oil refiners \u2013 they source less than 1% of their oil from Iran \u2013 it remains emotive in oil markets. \"This is supply related so it had a psychological impact,\" Ken Hasegawa, a Tokyo-based commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan, told Reuters. The EU has already slapped sanctions on Iran and has vowed to stop buying all Iranian oil by July. Iran was supplying more than 700,000 barrels a day to the EU last year but this had already been cut back by 300,000 before Sunday's move, according to industry website liveoilprices.co.uk. BP is among a number of major companies that have already stopped importing oil from Iran, triggering speculation that Sunday's announcement was merely political posturing.

It also hiked its forecast for 2013 to $125 a barrel, up from $121, arguing that geopolitical issues are creating increased demand for crude. Investors' appetite for riskier assets after China's central bank boosted lending capacity by more than $50bn (\u00a332bn), as well as a softer dollar against the euro on expectations Greece would secure a debt bailout this week, are also supporting oil prices. Buoyant prices have also pushed shares in BP to their highest level for almost a year.",

Households' appetite for major purchases hit levels not seen since the VAT hike in January 2011, while households are the least pessimistic about their financial prospects for the year ahead since April 2010.</p> <p>But while Markit's household finance index rose to 38.7 this month from 36.4 in January \u2013 above the average of 37.5 \u2013 it is still far below the neutral 50 threshold.</p> <p>The survey is released ahead of the latest official estimate for GDP in the fourth quarter \u2013 which showed a 0.2% contraction in the first estimate \u2013 later this week. It comes after the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/17/retail-spending-rise-uk-recession\" title=\"\"> surprisingly strong 0.9% rise in spending on the high street and online in January</a>, seen in a survey published on Friday.</p> <p>It also comes a month before George Osborne's budget, scheduled for 21 March, and as the chancellor's team in the Treasury remain locked in talks with banks about plans for \u00a320bn of \"credit easing\". This would take the form of a national loan guarantee scheme (NLGS) intended to support small businesses by helping banks borrow money more cheaply, which can in turn be passed on to businesses.</p> <p>An announcement is slated for 15 March, although it is not yet clear whether banks such as HSBC, which can already raise funds fairly cheaply, would join the NLGS. The Treasury insisted \"good progress\" was being made on how it would work.</p> <p>UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/14/uk-inflation-falls-shops-discount-vat?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">inflation fell sharply to 3.6% in January from 4.2%</a> in December, although most of this was due to the impact of last year's VAT rise on the annual rate. Petrol prices rose less sharply than a year ago and the cost of clothes, furniture and household goods came down.</p> <p>This is likely to continue. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, said: \"Plunging inflation through 2012 will ease the burden on households and could facilitate higher saving, lower borrowing and rising spending later this year.\"</p> <p>People's biggest worries are about job security and pay, both still falling at similar rates to those seen over the past three years, according to Markit.</p> <p>Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, said: \"Lower inflationary pressures are of course no silver bullet for household finances, and the strain on budgets from weak job market conditions shows little sign of abating.</p> <p>\"Income from employment dropped again in February, while job insecurities across the private sector were the most acute since mid-2009.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the survey showed the slowest deterioration in current household finances since December 2010.

      "bodyText": "Signs that the gloom over Britain's family finances is lifting emerged on Monday as lower inflation contributed to the least downbeat outlook in nearly two years. Even so, the pressure on household finances has persisted, according to a closely watched index that remains well below the level at which consumers report an optimistic outlook for the year ahead. According to a monthly snapshot from the data provider Markit, household debt stabilised in February while the number of people reporting rising demand for unsecured credit, such as credit cards, fell to the lowest level for 11 months. Households' appetite for major purchases hit levels not seen since the VAT hike in January 2011, while households are the least pessimistic about their financial prospects for the year ahead since April 2010. But while Markit's household finance index rose to 38.7 this month from 36.4 in January \u2013 above the average of 37.5 \u2013 it is still far below the neutral 50 threshold. The survey is released ahead of the latest official estimate for GDP in the fourth quarter \u2013 which showed a 0.2% contraction in the first estimate \u2013 later this week. It comes after the surprisingly strong 0.9% rise in spending on the high street and online in January, seen in a survey published on Friday. It also comes a month before George Osborne's budget, scheduled for 21 March, and as the chancellor's team in the Treasury remain locked in talks with banks about plans for \u00a320bn of \"credit easing\". This would take the form of a national loan guarantee scheme (NLGS) intended to support small businesses by helping banks borrow money more cheaply, which can in turn be passed on to businesses. An announcement is slated for 15 March, although it is not yet clear whether banks such as HSBC, which can already raise funds fairly cheaply, would join the NLGS. The Treasury insisted \"good progress\" was being made on how it would work. UK inflation fell sharply to 3.6% in January from 4.2% in December, although most of this was due to the impact of last year's VAT rise on the annual rate. Petrol prices rose less sharply than a year ago and the cost of clothes, furniture and household goods came down. This is likely to continue. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, said: \"Plunging inflation through 2012 will ease the burden on households and could facilitate higher saving, lower borrowing and rising spending later this year.\" People's biggest worries are about job security and pay, both still falling at similar rates to those seen over the past three years, according to Markit. Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, said: \"Lower inflationary pressures are of course no silver bullet for household finances, and the strain on budgets from weak job market conditions shows little sign of abating. \"Income from employment dropped again in February, while job insecurities across the private sector were the most acute since mid-2009.\" At the same time, the survey showed the slowest deterioration in current household finances since December 2010. About 30% of households were pessimistic about their finances, compared with 8% that reported an improvement. A survey by Lloyds showed that the fall in inflation had not fed through to households last month. Patrick Foley, Lloyds TSB's chief economist, said: \"The competing effects of falling inflation against a weakening in the employment and income situation are set to be the dominant theme of the first half of 2012.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is to announce that it intends to \"claw back\" bonuses from as many as 10 senior bankers because of the \u00a33.2bn losses that the bailed-out bank suffered after the payouts were awarded a year ago. Between 40% and 50% of the bonus pot is thought to be at risk. Details were still being finalised on Sunday night and the figure could drop as low as 25% \u2013 which may not satisfy some critics who will question why any bonuses should be paid out at all after the bank took the losses to cover the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Among those facing the consequences of the adjustment of the bonus pot caused by the PPI scandal are the former chief executive Eric Daniels and his closest lieutenants, some of whom have left the bank since his departure a year ago. Lloyds would not comment on Sunday night, but the chairman, Sir Win Bischoff, acknowledged at the bank's annual meeting in May that a clawback was being considered by the bank. \"The implications on compensation are being considered by the remuneration committee and will be determined by the board in due course,\" he told shareholders when asked about the implications of the PPI provision. In February 2011 Daniels was awarded a \u00a31.45m bonus for his work in 2010 as he announced that the bank had returned to profitability following its controversial rescue of HBOS. But just weeks after he left, his successor, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, announced that the bank would need to take the hit for the misselling of PPI, which is intended to keep paying off loans in the event of illness or job loss but often failed to live up to its promises. Lloyds is not alone in having to take a provision for the misselling of PPI, but it took the biggest hit in the industry, which has collectively been saddled with a bill of more than \u00a36bn. Among the other Lloyds bankers thought to be facing financial penalties for the losses that the bank will have to report for 2011 are Helen Weir, the former head of the retail banking arm, who was last week named as the new finance director of John Lewis. She received a bonus of \u00a3875,000 for 2010. Others are said to include Tim Tookey \u2013 the outgoing finance director, who is due to present the bank's 2011 losses to the City on Friday \u2013 and Truett Tate, the head of corporate banking, who is already facing controversy over a one-year payment he is contractually entitled to when he leaves in May. Tookey was awarded a bonus of \u00a3942,000 and Tate more than \u00a31m. Other members of the senior management team are also expected to receive lower bonuses than they had been expecting through a process that has not been fully tested since the banking crisis, when regulators demanded that bonuses could be \"clawed back\" in the event that performance turned sour in the future. The requirement was made after it emerged that thousands of bankers had walked away with multimillion-pound bonuses in 2007, only for their banks to report huge losses the following years. When Daniels was awarded the bonus \u2013 which was 63.3% of his maximum potential payout \u2013 in February 2011, it was deferred for three years, which means he has not yet received the money, in the form of shares. Other banks will also face questions about whether they are able to claw back bonuses for the losses they suffered as a result of PPI provisions, which none of the major players have been able to escape. Both bailed-out banks, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, are due to publish their 2011 results this week, and both are expected to be loss-making some three years after the October 2008 crisis. Details of executive pay are usually published up to three weeks later in the annual reports to shareholders.",
