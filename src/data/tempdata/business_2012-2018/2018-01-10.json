      "bodyText": "Just 10 days into 2018 and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and a thorn in the side of Donald Trump, has seen his personal wealth soar by $6bn (\u00a34.4bn). The man at the helm of the sprawling online empire \u2013 which accounted for an extraordinary 89% of online Christmas trading at big US retailers \u2013 Bezos is now worth $106bn, enough to cover Britain\u2019s budget deficit twice over and still have change. Officially, he is the richest man on the planet \u2013 the latest in a list of plutocrats stretching all the way back to Croesus, the king of Lydia in the 6th century BC who was so rich he had an expression name after him. Only once before has one man been worth twelve figures, when Bill Gates\u2019s fortune hit its peak of $100bn at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999. Bezos overtook Gates last year and the gap has widened almost daily. Even so, the impact of inflation means Bezos is not the richest man who ever lived. He is not even the richest American who ever lived: that title would go to one of the titans of US industry from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Andrew Carnegie, John D Rockefeller and Henry Ford all amassed fortunes that would make the Amazon founder a relative pauper once rising prices were taken into account. Looking further back, lists of the top 10 richest men of all time include William the Conqueror\u2019s relative Alan Rufus. According to the US magazine Money, when he died around 1093, Alan\u2019s estate was worth \u00a311,000. The Domesday Book had helpfully put a value on all property in England after the Norman conquest and Rufus held 7% of it. Bezos\u2019s wealth, by contrast, does not amount to even 1% of current US GDP; to match Rufus his wealth would need to be $1.25tn. Even less is known about other historical figures who controlled vast fortunes. From the Egyptian pharaohs to the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar and the Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, wealth down the ages has often been concentrated in the hands of the few. Nor is Bezos without question the richest man currently living. While it is relatively easy to work out the net worth of Bezos and Gates from the value of their share portfolios, nobody knows for sure how much members of the Saudi Arabian royal family are worth. Nor has anybody come up with a definitive figure for the net worth of Vladimir Putin, although rumour has it that the Russian president\u2019s fortune is bigger than that of Bezos or Gates. Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, is said to have salted away $200bn during his time in power. Bezos\u2019s wealth is disclosed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which looks at publicly available data on company ownership and stock market stakes, making it easy to quantify. The list is dominated by Americans, given their ownership of the world\u2019s biggest public companies. But others, from Russian oligarchs to leaders of developing nations, control vast undisclosed sums. Some may also be hidden due to opaque company structures, with funds or assets placed offshore. The increase in Bezos\u2019s wealth is a result of a surge in the value of Amazon shares \u2013 fuelled by a stock market rally that owes much to Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts, which came into force at the start of the year. Bezos owns 16% of Amazon, which has risen in value by more than 50% since the president\u2019s inauguration a year ago \u2013 an ironic situation given that Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a paper that has been a source of almost constant irritation for the US president, which he refers to as a factory of fake news. Nevertheless Bezos \u2013 born into a middle-class family in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1964 and who launched Amazon in 1994 selling books from his garage in Seattle \u2013 is now number one on the rich list ahead of Gates and the investor Warren Buffett. After taking inflation into account, the $100bn fortune belonging to Bill Gates would have been worth almost $150bn in today\u2019s money. The Microsoft founder might also have been worth more than Bezos today if he hadn\u2019t given away almost $36bn through the charitable foundation he runs with his wife, Melinda. Measured against the total wealth in the US at the time the dotcom bubble burst Gates was much richer than Bezos. According to Credit Suisse, total wealth in the world\u2019s largest economy has more than doubled to $93.5tn since the year 2000. Billionaires have been getting richer in recent years, at a time of growing concerns over inequality in developed nations. The world\u2019s super-rich have been estimated to now own the greatest concentration of wealth since the US Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th century, when industrialists such as Rockefeller and Carnegie grew rich beyond imagination. That period came to an end with the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. The world\u2019s 500 richest people increased their wealth by $1tn last year, buoyed by huge increases in the value of global shares. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Each time regulators lift the lid on the spread-betting industry the stench turns out to be horrible. \u201cConsumers may be at serious risk of harm from poor practices,\u201d says the Financial Conduct Authority after a 12-month review of how contracts-for-difference, or CFDs, are sold and marketed to amateur punters. By FCA standards, the language is extreme. Others might say it is describing a right old racket. A CFD is a way to bet on the price movement of a financial asset \u2013 such as a share, index or currency pair \u2013 without having to own anything. You win or lose according to the difference in price over the life of the contract, or when you close the bet. As ever with spread-betting, it\u2019s an opportunity to crank up returns in both directions via massive leverage, sometimes running to 100 times the original stake. In other words, CFDs are high-risk financial products, meaning firms are told to be careful about who is allowed to play, and how. Here is the rough summary of the FCA\u2019s review of 19 providers and 15 intermediaries: the rulebook is being widely ignored. Most firms couldn\u2019t define satisfactorily their target customer. Most providers had \u201cflawed due diligence processes\u201d for taking on distributors. Conflicts of interest are rife. One firm had its chief executive as its head of compliance, which is a serious no-no. Perhaps we should not be surprised. When 76% of the customers are losing money \u2013 the FCA\u2019s statistic \u2013 the incentive for firms to cut corners is plainly great. Several firms have now pulled out of the market, reports the regulator, and action will be taken against one. Really, though, you\u2019d expect a stiffer general response than a \u201cDear CEO\u201d letter, which amounts to a warning to firms to get their act together. Consumer protection has limits, of course, since a regulator can\u2019t always save punters from their own foolishness. And, yes, there may be truth in the idea promoted by self-declared respectable spread-betting operators that a wave of Cypriot-based new arrivals has caused most of the problems. But come on, complaints about this industry are not new. The hope is that tougher EU rules to be adopted by the UK will finally improve standards. Maybe. But it will require the FCA to do better with the new regime than it has with the laxer one \u2013 writing letters doesn\u2019t quite cut it. M&amp;S leads way on pay \u2026 sort of Humphrey Singer is a good hire for Marks &amp; Spencer as finance director, everybody agrees, but there are two notable features to this appointment. The first reflects well on M&amp;S. Singer is joining from Dixons Carphone without the usual adornments of a free car (with driver) plus outsized pension benefits. The latter allowance has been royally abused by companies. A director\u2019s non-participation in the corporate scheme has become an underhand way to hand him or her more up-front cash while filing the sums under the innocuous heading of \u201cpensions\u201d. But when these \u201cin lieu\u201d payments have reached 25% of salary \u2013 the current rate for M&amp;S executives \u2013 they have lost all connection with pension benefits as understood by the rest of the population. You can be sure the workers aren\u2019t getting 25% contributions. Singer will still be entitled to bonuses and share incentives at M&amp;S, but his basic whack will be a clean \u00a3600,000. On a comparable basis \u2013 in other words, including her car and pension nonsense \u2013 the outgoing Helen Weir was getting \u00a3757,000. If Singer\u2019s clearer (and lower) basic package implies more transparency on pay under the newish M&amp;S chairman, Archie Norman, it\u2019s very welcome. M&amp;S could do with a dose of that. Others should follow the lead. The other oddity doesn\u2019t look so good. Weir is being allowed to leave at the end of March to pursue her \u201cplural\u201d career but will be paid according to her contract until early November. That might be understandable if Singer\u2019s arrival coincided with Weir\u2019s exit, but it won\u2019t. Dixons Carphone expects to keep him until July. So there could be three or four months when M&amp;S is without a permanent finance director but is paying Weir \u00a314,500 a week to stay at home. Nice work if you can get it. Sainsbury\u2019s ahead of schedule Sainsbury\u2019s refusal to give separate trading figures for Argos rightly frustrates retail analysts, but the general picture seems clear. The \u00a31.1bn takeover of the chain in 2016 remains a smart piece of business when you remember that the buyer inherited a \u00a3700m credit book.

By FCA standards, the language is extreme. Others might say it is describing a right old racket.</p> <p>A CFD is a way to bet on the price movement of a financial asset \u2013 such as a share, index or currency pair \u2013 without having to own anything. You win or lose according to the difference in price over the life of the contract, or when you close the bet.</p> <p>As ever with spread-betting, it\u2019s an opportunity to crank up returns in both directions via massive leverage, sometimes running to 100 times the original stake.

Most firms couldn\u2019t define satisfactorily their target customer. Most providers had \u201cflawed due diligence processes\u201d for taking on distributors. Conflicts of interest are rife. One firm had its chief executive as its head of compliance, which is a serious no-no.</p> <p>Perhaps we should not be surprised. When 76% of the customers are losing money \u2013 the FCA\u2019s statistic \u2013 the incentive for firms to cut corners is plainly great.</p> <p>Several firms have now pulled out of the market, reports the regulator, and action will be taken against one. Really, though, you\u2019d expect a stiffer general response than a \u201cDear CEO\u201d letter, which amounts to a warning to firms to get their act together.</p> <p>Consumer protection has limits, of course, since a regulator can\u2019t always save punters from their own foolishness. And, yes, there may be truth in the idea promoted by self-declared respectable spread-betting operators that a wave of Cypriot-based new arrivals has caused most of the problems.</p> <p>But come on, complaints about this industry are not new. The hope is that tougher EU rules to be adopted by the UK will finally improve standards. Maybe.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Government admits plans in place for Carillion collapse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has made contingency plans for the collapse of Carillion, the UK\u2019s second largest construction company and a key provider of public services. The troubled contractor \u2013 which has 20,000 UK staff and is an important supplier to the government, including a contract for work on the HS2 rail link \u2013 held crunch talks with its creditors on Wednesday to try to persuade them to back a rescue plan. The company ran into financial difficulties last year after issuing three profit warnings in five months and writing down more than \u00a31bn from the value of contracts. It has debts of about \u00a31bn and a \u00a3600m pension deficit, but a stock market value of just \u00a3100m after its shares collapsed 90%. Last week it emerged Carillion was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the \u201ctimeliness and content of announcements\u201d made by the company between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017. The proposed refinancing is expected to involve its lenders swapping their debt for Carillion shares, which would leave existing investors with little or nothing. As part of the package, its pension fund or the pension protection fund could end up as a major shareholder. Lenders including HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which saw the details of the restructuring proposals for the first time at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, were not expected to rush into making an immediate decision. If no agreement can be reached, the company could be forced to seek emergency financial support from the government. This could take the form of an emergency loan, a repricing of some deals or the company handing back loss-making contracts. The Labour MP Jon Trickett told parliament: \u201cDespite being investigated by FSA and with debts of \u00a31.5bn Carillion remains a major supplier in terms of government procurement. If they were to collapse it would risk massive damage to a range of public services. \u201cDoes the government have a contingency plan for such an eventuality and what is the cost to the taxpayer?\u201d Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary, replied: \u201cWe of course make contingency plans for all eventualities \u2026 Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supply market and working closely with key suppliers. \u201cCarillion\u2019s operational performance has continued to be positive, for example they advanced their work on Crossrail over the Christmas period.\u201d A government spokesperson said earlier: \u201cThe company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress.\u201d The company, which employs 10,000 people overseas, has been working on the revamp of Battersea power station, Liverpool Football Club\u2019s new main stand, and the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital. It is the second largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, as well as running prisons. It came close to breaching the terms of its borrowings last month, but its lenders agreed to a four-month extension until the end of April. Before the meeting on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the company said: \u201cCarillion is in constructive discussions with a broad range of stakeholders regarding its options to reduce net debt and recapitalise and/or restructure the group\u2019s balance sheet. \u201cThe group is currently finalising its business plan, which \u2026 will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d The company\u2019s chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down in July after the first profit warning. Its new boss, Andrew Davies, is due this month to take over from the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, three months earlier than planned. Carillion\u2019s shares rose 8% to 22.6p on Wednesday on hopes it would reach an agreement on the refinancing. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress.\u201d</p> <p>The company, which employs 10,000 people overseas, has been working on the revamp of Battersea power station, Liverpool Football Club\u2019s new main stand, and the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital. </p> <p>It is the second largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, as well as running prisons.<br></p> <p>It came close to breaching the terms of its borrowings last month, but its lenders agreed to a four-month extension until the end of April.</p> <p>Before the meeting on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the company said: \u201cCarillion is in constructive discussions with a broad range of stakeholders regarding its options to reduce net debt and recapitalise and/or restructure the group\u2019s balance sheet.</p> <p>\u201cThe group is currently finalising its business plan, which \u2026 will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down in July after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/carillion-boss-richard-howson-steps-down-shares-crash\">first profit warning</a>.

      "bodyText": "The good employment news of 2017 looks set to continue into the new year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed on Wednesday that job vacancies in the November quarter last year grew by 4.1%, marking more than four years of consecutive growth and meaning it is easier now on average for the unemployed to get a job than it has been for six years. The question now is whether this good news will also lead to better wages growth. Job vacancies are one of the key forward-looking employment indicators \u2013 so called because while they do not measure actual employment they are a strong indicator of employment growth to come. In the three months to November last year, there was a record 192,000 private sector job vacancies, 4.6% above that of the August quarter and 17.7% above the number recorded a year earlier. That is some seriously strong growth \u2013 the best since we came out of the GFC. It means that private sector vacancies have been rising for 17 consecutive quarters \u2013 more than four years. The public sector however saw a decline in vacancies in November, the first such decline since November 2013. But as the public sector accounts for only around 10% of all job vacancies, it meant the overall number of vacancies still grew in November by 4.1% and by 16.8% annually: And while job vacancies by themselves are a handy indicator, economists like to compare them with the overall size of the labour force to get a better indicator of how things are going. The job vacancy rate measures the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force (which includes those working and unemployed). An increasing vacancy rate is better as it indicates the number of vacancies are growing by more than is the labour force. And here as well the news is very good. The vacancy rate in November was above 1.6% for the first time since February 2011, and is just below the record rate of 1.65% that occurred at the end of the mining boom in 2008: The vacancy rate is also linked with the unemployment rate in a relationship shown by what is called \u201cthe Beveridge curve\u201d. Essentially as the vacancy rate rises, the unemployment rate should fall. The current vacancy rate of 1.6% should normally be associated with lower unemployment, but one of the problems of shifting from a mining boom to a period where the job growth is more spread across the nation and in different industries is that it can be more difficult to fill jobs than in the recent past: But even still, this does suggest that the unemployment rate should be more likely to fall than rise if the job vacancy rate stays where it is. And one reason the unemployment rate should fall is that at the moment it is on average easier to get a job than it has been for six years. In November there were 3.4 unemployed for every job vacancy \u2013 which makes it 12 consecutive quarters were the fight to get a job has gotten easier. Of course underemployment has been a major issue over the past few years, but even here things look to be improving. While not every underemployed worker is looking for another job (most would just like to get more hours in their current job), if we do include the underemployed among those fighting for one of those vacancies, there are 8.6 underutilised workers (ie underemployed and unemployed) for every vacancy. While that does sound high, it is the lowest it has been since August 2012: The other good thing about this is that fewer people fighting for each job vacancies means the job market is actually becoming quite tight. When the number of unemployed per vacancy falls, it also means employers have a tougher job finding someone to fill a position. This should lead to higher wages as employers look to pay more in order to encourage workers not to leave. But as ever the difficulty or ease of finding a job depends on where you live and what type of work you do. Currently New South Wales is the easiest state to get work \u2013 just 2.2 unemployed on average per vacancy, the lowest on record. Victoria is a bit more difficult with 3.1 unemployed per vacancy and Queensland just a touch harder at 3.9. While South Australia and Tasmania are the toughest states to get a job \u2013 5.8 and 5.9 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 both are better now than they have been for most of the past four years. Western Australia is perhaps the only concern. While the current 4.3 unemployed per vacancy is well down on the number that were after each job in early 2016, there has been a slight rise in the unemployment fight over the past nine months: We\u2019re not able to calculate the number of unemployed per vacancy by industry (because while you may be looking for work in the mining industry for example, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t also look for a job in construction), but we can get a proxy vacancy rate by looking at the number of vacancies as a percentage of those employed in that industry. As ever the highest total number of vacancies are in the more transitory/casual industries of retail trade and administration and support, but almost all industries have seen an improvement in the vacancy rate over the past two years. Even the mining industry has seen an increase in the number of vacancies per employed. There has also been strong gains in the education, healthcare, and public administration industries: Fighting for a job is of course rarely as easy as these figures suggest. When you go for a position, you will be more likely to be competing with more than one other person \u2013 even if you live in New South Wales. But what these figures do show is that the fight to get work has improved across all states and virtually all industries. But as we know what has not improved is the pay of that work. Over the past few years economists have surmised that workers have been worried more about their hours than their wage \u2013 but with a near record low numbers of unemployed available for vacancies, that means workers are becoming more valuable to employers as they are harder to replace. If these conditions don\u2019t lead to improved wages growth then it will be clear that the old rules have broken down \u2013 much as has the link between unemployment and wages growth. These very good job vacancy figures highlight more than ever that 2018 should be the year of better wages growth, and if it isn\u2019t, workers \u2013 and voters \u2013 will be very much entitled to complain.",

The question now is whether this good news will also lead to better wages growth.</p> <p>Job vacancies are one of the key forward-looking employment indicators \u2013 so called because while they do not measure actual employment they are a strong indicator of employment growth to come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/dec/17/this-year-has-been-about-companies-and-jobs-will-2018-be-about-wages\">This year has been about companies and jobs. Will 2018 be about wages? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the three months to November last year, there was a record 192,000 private sector job vacancies, 4.6% above that of the August quarter and 17.7% above the number recorded a year earlier. </p> <p>That is some seriously strong growth \u2013 the best since we came out of the GFC. It means that private sector vacancies have been rising for 17 consecutive quarters \u2013 more than four years. </p> <p>The public sector however saw a decline in vacancies in November, the first such decline since November 2013. But as the public sector accounts for only around 10% of all job vacancies, it meant the overall number of vacancies still grew in November by 4.1% and by 16.8% annually:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies - quarterly growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/56d9T/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while job vacancies by themselves are a handy indicator, economists like to compare them with the overall size of the labour force to get a better indicator of how things are going. </p> <p>The job vacancy rate measures the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force (which includes those working and unemployed). An increasing vacancy rate is better as it indicates the number of vacancies are growing by more than is the labour force. And here as well the news is very good. </p> <p>The vacancy rate in November was above 1.6% for the first time since February 2011, and is just below the record rate of 1.65% that occurred at the end of the mining boom in 2008:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancy rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FOQZr/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The vacancy rate is also linked with the unemployment rate in a relationship shown by what is called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_curve\">the Beveridge curve</a>\u201d. Essentially as the vacancy rate rises, the unemployment rate should fall. The current vacancy rate of 1.6% should normally be associated with lower unemployment, but one of the problems of shifting from a mining boom to a period where the job growth is more spread across the nation and in different industries is that it can be more difficult to fill jobs than in the recent past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Beveridge curve - 1978-2017\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mPI1v/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even still, this does suggest that the unemployment rate should be more likely to fall than rise if the job vacancy rate stays where it is. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/nov/21/a-few-states-are-driving-growth-but-stagnant-wages-remain-an-ecomonic-puzzle\">A few states are driving growth, but stagnant wages remain an economic puzzle | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And one reason the unemployment rate should fall is that at the moment it is on average easier to get a job than it has been for six years. </p> <p>In November there were 3.4 unemployed for every job vacancy \u2013 which makes it 12 consecutive quarters were the fight to get a job has gotten easier.</p> <p>Of course underemployment has been a major issue over the past few years, but even here things look to be improving. While not every underemployed worker is looking for another job (most would just like to get more hours in their current job), if we do include the underemployed among those fighting for one of those vacancies, there are 8.6 underutilised workers (ie underemployed and unemployed) for every vacancy. </p> <p>While that does sound high, it is the lowest it has been since August 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per vacancy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bsffR/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The other good thing about this is that fewer people fighting for each job vacancies means the job market is actually becoming quite tight. When the number of unemployed per vacancy falls, it also means employers have a tougher job finding someone to fill a position. This should lead to higher wages as employers look to pay more in order to encourage workers not to leave. </p> <p>But as ever the difficulty or ease of finding a job depends on where you live and what type of work you do. </p> <p>Currently New South Wales is the easiest state to get work \u2013 just 2.2 unemployed on average per vacancy, the lowest on record. Victoria is a bit more difficult with 3.1 unemployed per vacancy and Queensland just a touch harder at 3.9. </p> <p>While South Australia and Tasmania are the toughest states to get a job \u2013 5.8 and 5.9 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 both are better now than they have been for most of the past four years. </p> <p>Western Australia is perhaps the only concern. While the current 4.3 unemployed per vacancy is well down on the number that were after each job in early 2016, there has been a slight rise in the unemployment fight over the past nine months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per vacancy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2JG9O/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re not able to calculate the number of unemployed per vacancy by industry (because while you may be looking for work in the mining industry for example, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t also look for a job in construction), but we can get a proxy vacancy rate by looking at the number of vacancies as a percentage of those employed in that industry. </p> <p>As ever the highest total number of vacancies are in the more transitory/casual industries of retail trade and administration and support, but almost all industries have seen an improvement in the vacancy rate over the past two years.</p> <p>Even the mining industry has seen an increase in the number of vacancies per employed. There has also been strong gains in the education, healthcare, and public administration industries: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies per employed by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ke9yN/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Fighting for a job is of course rarely as easy as these figures suggest. When you go for a position, you will be more likely to be competing with more than one other person \u2013 even if you live in New South Wales. But what these figures do show is that the fight to get work has improved across all states and virtually all industries. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/nov/16/it-seems-wages-cant-grow-any-slower-and-no-rebound-is-in-sight\">It seems wages can't grow any slower - and no rebound is in sight | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as we know what has not improved is the pay of that work. Over the past few years economists have surmised that workers have been worried more about their hours than their wage \u2013 but with a near record low numbers of unemployed available for vacancies, that means workers are becoming more valuable to employers as they are harder to replace. </p> <p>If these conditions don\u2019t lead to improved wages growth then it will be clear that the old rules have broken down \u2013 much as has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/nov/16/it-seems-wages-cant-grow-any-slower-and-no-rebound-is-in-sight\">the link between unemployment and wages growth</a>. </p> <p>These very good job vacancy figures highlight more than ever that 2018 should be the year of better wages growth, and if it isn\u2019t, workers \u2013 and voters \u2013 will be very much entitled to complain.</p>",

Clark is expected to express concern at 250 fresh job losses announced this week, which took the total to 650 since PSA bought Opel-Vauxhall for \u00a31.9bn last year, pledging to turn it around without closures or staff cuts. As Clark headed to Paris, Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain\u2019s largest trade union Unite, warned that the union would ensure PSA\u2019s UK sales were \u201cfinished for good\u201d if the plant is closed. PSA, which also owns Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, has reduced operations at Ellesmere Port to restore profitability. It has still not decided whether to build new models at the Cheshire plant, which employs 1,800 of its 4,500 UK workforce to build the Astra, amid uncertainty about the future of Britain\u2019s trading relationship with the European Union. Clark, whose meeting with Tavares was scheduled before the latest cuts, is expected to reiterate a promise to PSA that the government will go to great lengths to cushion the automotive industry from any Brexit-related impact. He is thought to have made the same four promises that were instrumental in persuading Nissan to expand its Sunderland operations. Clark told the Japanese firm that the government would ensure more suppliers are based in the UK, fund research in electric vehicles, offer support for training staff and make sure the Brexit deal leaves auto firms \u201cfree and unencumbered\u201d. McCluskey warned Tavares that the union \u201cwill not allow them to continue to enjoy their healthy share of the UK market\u201d if Ellesmere Port is closed. \u201cI\u2019m going to France in the next fortnight to meet with Carlos Tavares to tell him that we will not allow PSA to close a healthy UK plant,\u201d McCluskey said on Twitter. \u201cI will make it crystal clear ... that if there is any attempt to close the Ellesmere Port Vauxhall plant we will make sure their market in the UK is finished for good,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The longest spell of rising output from Britain\u2019s factories in 23 years has left the economy on course to record its fastest rate of growth since late 2016, one of the country\u2019s leading thinktanks has forecast. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said it was pencilling in expansion in gross domestic product of 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017, up from 0.4% in the previous three months and above the latest City estimates. Amit Kara, Niesr\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, said activity had picked up in the second half of last year, following a weak start to the year in which GDP increased by 0.3% in the first two quarters. \u201cThe recovery has been driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by the weaker pound and a buoyant global economy, while construction output continues to lag,\u201d Kara said. \u201cIn November, we had forecast final quarter GDP growth at 0.5% and as such, today\u2019s revised estimate suggests that activity has strengthened by more than we had previously anticipated.\u201d The thinktank believes the stronger than expected performance of the economy, coupled with inflation above the 2% target, will lead to the Bank of England raising interest rates by 0.25 points to 0.75% in May, with further increases every six months until by mid 2021, official borrowing costs have reached 2%. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed UK factories grew their output for an eighth consecutive month in November, a feat last seen in May 1994, with manufacturers helped by a broadly based upswing in the global economy. Manufacturing output was 1.4% higher in the three months to the end of November than in the preceding quarter. The increase in factory output helped drive growth in overall industrial production, which includes output from mines, quarries, the oil and gas industry, and energy plants, up by 0.4% over the period. A cold snap in November bolstered energy production after warmer weather in October. Among manufacturers, the fabrication of machinery and equipment provided the largest contribution to growth, with an upturn in renewable energy projects and other big-ticket work. Ole Black, a senior ONS statistician, said: \u201cThere was strong and widespread growth across manufacturing, with notable increases from renewable energy projects, boats, planes and cars for export.\u201d The improving outlook for industrial production, which accounts for about 14% of GDP, has helped compensate for stuttering consumer spending growth, which has been affected by an increase in the cost of imported goods caused by the depreciation of sterling since the the Brexit vote. The construction industry is having its toughest period for more than five years, with a 2% contraction in the three months to November marking the sixth successive period of decline. Despite the decrease over the quarter, there was a small upturn in November of 0.4%, compared with the previous month. The stronger global economy is helping Britain export more goods and services to the rest of the world. Although the UK continues to import more than it exports, as has been the case for several years, the deficit narrowed by \u00a32.1bn in the three months to November, the ONS said. Black said: \u201cThe trade deficit narrowed in the past three months, due mainly to increased exports of services, and shipments of works of art and cars. Over the past year, exports of goods, particularly cars, machinery and crude oil, have continued to increase, and at a faster rate than imports.\u201d Some economists warned growth in the final three months of 2017 would be lower than Niesr is predicting due to disruption to the Forties oil pipeline last month.

Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece now, where thousands of protestors have taken to the streets on the first day of a parliamentary debate about austerity measures. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Public sector unionists and communist-affiliated workers took to the streets in fury over yet more reforms included in a multi-bill of \u2018prior actions\u2019 submitted to parliament. Among the most contentious is the demand that Greece pare back the right of unionists to press ahead with industrial action - in a country where strikes are regarded as a hallowed right won with sweat and blood. Demonstrators also converged on courts in angry scenes protesting against electronic auctions of properties belonging to indebted bank depositors. Athens has to enforce the measures to conclude a compliance review that will unlock more rescue funds (an estimated \u20ac5.5bn) given the debt-stricken nation\u2019s exclusion from capital markets. The leftist-led government is keen to legislate the measures in time for the next EU leaders\u2019 summit meeting on 22 January. Billionaire investor Warren Buffet is the latest big name to predict a burst bubble for bitcoin.

Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don\u2019t know anything about. The Financial Conduct Authority has warned spread betting firms could be putting UK consumers at serious risk of harm. Shares in the sector fell sharply after the warning this morning about the contracts for difference market. CFDs are a type of high-risk, complex derivative that allow investors to gamble on the price of an asset without owning it. Read our full story here: Superdry is the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, with shares down 8%, after the clothing retailer announced a fall in profits despite a positive Christmas performance: The RAC says the recent rise in oil prices to just below $70 could be bad news for UK motorists without a significant strengthening of the pound. The breakdown recovery firm warns the rise could potentially put further pressure on Britain\u2019s cash-strapped consumers if they have to pay more at the pump. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman at the RAC, comments: Oil hitting $70 a barrel is potentially very bad for motorists who are already having to get used to paying 7p a litre more for petrol and 9p more for diesel than they did last July. If oil stays at this level, pump price hikes will be almost inevitable. With households across the country still feeling the cost of Christmas this is not the start to 2018 anyone would have wanted. It could also negatively affect business and further fuel inflation. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is just a touch below $70 at $69.33, the highest level since 5 December 2014. Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017, according to an estimate by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research*. That would be the fastest rate of growth since the final three months of 2016, and would put annual growth in 2017 at 1.8%, slightly below growth of 1.9% in 2016. The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the thinktank, says: We estimate that economic growth recovered to 0.6% in the final quarter of this year from 0.4% in the third quarter. Economic growth has picked up in the second half of 2017 after a period of subdued growth in the first six months. The recovery has been driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by the weaker pound and a buoyant global economy, while construction output continues to lag. We\u2019ll have to wait until 26 January for the first official estimate from the ONS. *In this morning\u2019s agenda I incorrectly stated the NIESR estimate would be published at 1pm. Sorry about that. AM The UK\u2019s small exporting firms are optimistic about the future, according to the trade body that represents them, despite Britain\u2019s wider trade deficit in November. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the broader trend was more positive, with the trade in goods and services deficit narrowing by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a36.2bn in the three months to November. Mike Cherry, national chairman at the FSB: It\u2019s a positive step to see the UK\u2019s total trade deficit narrowing in the three months to November 2017. Our own research shows exporting small firms remain optimistic about trade prospects, with an increase in those reporting either stable or increasing international sales in the last quarter of 2017. Our exporters continue to benefit from a depreciated pound and strong economic growth overseas. \u201cThe success of the UK economy rests on helping more small businesses to export, and with nine in ten small firms that do business internationally trading with EU nations, securing the right Brexit deal will be crucial. The ONS stats show an increase in exports to non-EU countries have contributed to the narrowing of the deficit, showing the importance of new agreements with key markets beyond Europe. Here is our full story on the UK data published this morning: Britain\u2019s business secretary Greg Clark is in Paris for talks with Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of PSA, owner of Peugeot and Vauxhall. Concerns over the future of the Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port mounted after another 250 job cuts were announced this week, bringing the total number of redundancies announced over the past three months to 650. The cuts mean that more than a third of the workforce will have been lost since PSA took control last year. The pound is slightly up against the dollar, rising 0.1% to $1.3551. Earlier it dipped below $1.35 for the first time in a week, despite some fairly upbeat UK data. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.5% at \u20ac1.1291. The dollar meanwhile is down 0.6% against a basket of other major currencies, its biggest drop in a month. The FTSE 100 has slipped into the red, failing to hang on to earlier gains as markets across Europe fall: Britain\u2019s manufacturers are benefiting from the \u201cupswing\u201d in the global economy according to Christian Jaccarini at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. As the manufacturing sector is relatively outward-looking, producing around 45% of exports despite accounting for just 10% of UK employment, manufacturers have been significantly helped by a buoyant global economy and the weakened pound in recent quarters. The eurozone, which accounts for almost half of UK exports, is performing strongly and economic forecasters are unambiguously optimistic about its prospects moving forward. Though significant geopolitical threats remain, the world economic outlook is also positive. World air freight rose as much in 2017 as it has in the previous five years taken together. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says the ONS data published this morning suggests the UK economy ended 2017 on a decent note. The first official estimate of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 will be published on 26 January, but think tank NIESR will give its own estimate at 1pm today. The economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter. Clarke says: UK GDP growth for the 4th quarter of 2017 is looking good again after some encouraging industrial and construction output data for November. These are the last concrete official monthly data that feed directly into the GDP arithmetic and give us the best clues to the likely growth rate when the data are released on 26 January. The manufacturers\u2019 trade body, EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said firms were feeling positive about prospects for the year ahead. A quick check in the rear view mirror confirms that UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth. Exports continue to pick up with the pace of growth in goods headed overseas outpacing the rate at which we\u2019re sucking in imports, enabling us to start chipping away at our sizeable trade deficit. Manufacturers\u2019 expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy. This, together with an on-going commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, points out that industrial production has grown now for eight consecutive months, making it the longest run of growth since May 1994. A breakdown of the figures for industrial production - which grew 0.4% in November - showed growth in two of the four sub sectors over the month. Energy supply rose by 3.2% as temperatures dropped in November Manufacturing output was up 0.4%. There was broad-based strength in the sector, which helped to offset a sharp 7.1% fall in car production as demand slides Mining and quarrying fell by 1.4% Water supply, sewerage, and waste management dipped 0.8% The Office for National Statistics has published some key data on UK trade, industrial production and construction output. Here are the headline figures: Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world was the biggest in five months in November, rising to \u00a312.2bn from \u00a311.7bn in October Industrial production was stronger than expected, increasing by 0.4% in November following a 0.2% rise in October. Manufacturing output increased by 0.4%, beating expectations and the previous month Construction output was weaker than forecast, rising by 0.4% in November following a 1.1% drop a month earlier. Ole Black, senior statistician at the ONS, comments: There was strong and widespread growth across manufacturing with notable increases from renewable energy projects, boats, planes and cars for export. However, despite a small uptick in November, construction again contracted in the last three months, with private house building providing the only positive news in the sector. The trade deficit narrowed in the last three months, mainly due to increased exports of services, shipments of works of art and cars. Over the last year exports of goods, particularly cars, machinery and crude oil, have continued to increase, and at a faster rate than imports. Lidl had record UK sales in December, up 16%, as more customers visited the German discounter. Shoppers bought about 600 tonnes of Brussels sprouts, 17m mince pies and more than 800,000 litres of champagne and prosecco. Lidl cited research from Kantar Worldpanel that concluded it was the fastest-growing supermarket over the festive period. Christian H\u00e4rtnagel, the chief executive of Lidl UK, said: Lidl UK has had a fantastic 2017 and this was capped by our strongest Christmas trading period to date. Customers came into our stores to buy more of their Christmas items, knowing they could find high-quality products at market-leading prices. We look forward to bringing the Lidl offering to more communities across the UK, as we continue our rapid expansion plan this year. Moss Bros has fallen into the category of Christmas loser after issuing a surprise profit warning this morning. The menswear retailer and suit hire business said fewer than expected customers visited its shops in December. Moss Bros now expects full-year, pre-tax profit in the range of \u00a36.5m-\u00a36.8m, slightly below current market expectations. Its chief executive, Brian Brick, gives his assessment: Having made considerable progress in building a strong, profitable, cash-generative menswear business, which has outperformed the market in recent years and despite continued progress throughout much of 2017, we faced a very tough December trading environment, which led to a significant reduction in store footfall and a hardening of the corresponding competitive environment in which we operate. In common with many UK retailers, the year ahead looks like being an extremely challenging one, not least because of the uncertain consumer environment, wider political backdrop and significant cost headwinds we face from a weaker pound, business rates and increasing employee-related costs. Having hit a closing high on Tuesday, the FTSE 100 has continued to make gains this morning, up about 10 points. Financial stocks and Sainsbury\u2019s are among the biggest risers, as the leading index outperforms most of its European peers. The latest scores across Europe this morning: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,740 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 13,348 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,515 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 23,071 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.03% at 10,430 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 399 Sainsbury\u2019s is the latest big retailer to give an update of its trading performance over the crucial Christmas period. It\u2019s a mixed bag. Total sales were up 1.2% in the three months to 6 January and 1.1% on a like-for-like basis. That was in line with expectations. Grocery sales rose 2.3%. But general merchandise sales fell 1.3%, reflecting the growing reluctance among consumers to spend as much on non-essential, discretionary items. Sainsbury\u2019s said profit would be moderately ahead of the expected \u00a3559m because it had found more ways to save money by merging its supermarkets with Argos. This is what its chief executive, Mike Coupe, had to say: We\u2019re pleased with our performance across the group this quarter. We had a strong Christmas week, with record sales, more than 340,000 online grocery orders and stellar growth in Argos fast-track delivery and collection. Online accounted for 20% of the group\u2019s sales during the quarter. Friday 22 [December] was our biggest sales day for stores and we also delivered an online grocery order to customers every second. Customers bought more Taste the Difference food than last year as people treated themselves and our popular 25p veg lines helped our customers live well for less. Read our full story here: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, financial markets, eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for UK data, as official figures will shed light on how various parts of the economy are performing. The ONS figures on trade, manufacturing and construction will cover the month of November, giving a clearer picture of the state of the wider economy in the final quarter of 2017. Britain has started to slip down the G7 league table of growth, and today\u2019s figures will provide a backdrop to David Davis and Philip Hammond\u2019s trip to Germany, as the Brexit secretary and chancellor make a direct plea to German businesses to help them secure a good deal. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says it\u2019s an important day for UK data. Manufacturing has been a standout performer for the UK in Q4, if various independent surveys are to be believed, so it would be a surprise if today\u2019s ONS announcements don\u2019t confirm that picture. The agenda: 9.30am: UK trade figures are expected to show the goods deficit was roughly unchanged in November at \u00a310.7bn. 9.30am: UK construction data for November is forecast to show a 0.8% rise in output, following a 1.7% drop in October. 9.30am: Industrial production and manufacturing figures are expected to show faster growth for the sectors in November. 1pm: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research will publish its estimate of UK growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also in the spotlight today are Sainsbury\u2019s and fashion brand Superdry. Both companies have updated the market on their Christmas trading performance.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has warned of a challenging market as it reported sales in line with expectations despite a tough time for its Argos chain. Sales at established stores rose by 1.1% in the three months to 6 January and total sales were up by 1.2%. The company said grocery sales increased by 2.3%, behind the pace of food price inflation, but ahead of the 1.4% growth achieved in the previous quarter. General merchandise sales fell by 1.4%, largely because of the closure of dozens of Argos outlets in Homebase stores after the catalogue shop\u2019s demerger from the DIY chain. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said Argos had increased its share of a tough market as it sold more games consoles and audio technology but fewer toys. \u201cThe market is challenging and there is a bit of squeeze on disposable income. Where [shoppers] are able to defer purchases, they do,\u201d he said. Clothing sales rose by 1%, compared with 6% growth in the previous quarter. Although sales of winterwear were lower because of the warm autumn, Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s had increased its market share in clothing. He said supermarkets were benefiting as people chose to eat at home rather than out to save money but the group had to be \u201ccautious about the outlook, reflective of the consumer environment\u201d. The group, which is Britain\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain, said profits would be about \u00a328m higher than previous estimates of \u00a3559m because cost savings following its takeover of Argos were coming through more rapidly than expected. Sainsbury\u2019s subdued trading figures came as Lidl said it had increased sales by 16% year on year in December.

      "bodyText": "Anti-gambling campaigners have voiced fears that new culture secretary, Matt Hancock, will shy away from strict curbs on fixed-odds betting terminals, as it emerged the machines are taking more revenue than ever from British punters. Anti-FOBT campaigners warned that Hancock, who replaced Karen Bradley in this week\u2019s cabinet reshuffle by Theresa May, may be less inclined to curb the machines, citing his voting record and ties to the horseracing industry, which is funded partly through a levy on bookmakers\u2019 profits. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will this month conclude a consultation on whether FOBT stakes should be reduced from \u00a3100 to between \u00a32 and \u00a350. Figures released by the Gambling Commission before the decision show the sum that gamblers lost on FOBTs rose from \u00a31.76bn to \u00a31.82bn in the year to March 2017, despite 3% fewer machines to 33,611. The changes mean gamblers lost an average of more than \u00a354,000 per machine, up from \u00a350,777 the previous year. Hancock\u2019s West Suffolk constituency includes Newmarket racecourse, and an email seen by the Guardian shows that he recently organised a day there for MPs, partly funded by the British Horseracing Authority. Hancock has voted against tighter regulation on six occasions since becoming a minister in 2010, in line with his party, including measures that would have given local councils more power to prevent the proliferation of FOBTs. The Labour MP Carolyn Harris urged Hancock not to shy away from clamping down on FOBTs. \u201cHistorically, Matt Hancock has had close links to the horse racing industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI would strongly urge him to continue with the government\u2019s important work of tackling the many harms caused by FOBTs. \u201cAny change in this policy would clearly be a significant U-turn by the government at a very late stage in the process.\u201d One longtime FOBT campaigner, who asked not to be named to ensure good relations with the new minister, said Hancock had \u201cbeen to the races and probably had an earful of nonsense from the bookies about how a \u00a32 stake on FOBTs will destroy racing. \u201cHopefully he\u2019s wise enough to know that FOBTs are responsible for racing\u2019s decline as they\u2019re taking potential customers away from it.\u201d The DCMS said: \u201cWe have been clear that FOBT stakes will be cut to ensure we have a safe and sustainable industry where vulnerable people and children are protected,\u201d adding that a final decision would be made \u201cin due course\u201d. The Association of British Bookmakers says cutting FOBT stakes to \u00a32 would cost thousands of jobs, damage the horse-racing industry and cut gambling duty paid to the Treasury. But a new report by Bacta, a trade body which represents the amusement arcade industry and has clashed with bookmakers, will say that bookies\u2019 revenues would only fall by \u00a3335m, 47% lower than a government estimate of \u00a3689m. The report, written by the economics consultancy CEBR and due to be published on Wednesday, says this should be set against an estimated \u00a31.2bn cost to the public purse caused by problem gambling, of which \u00a3210m is associated with FOBTs. The CEBR\u2019s chief economist, Oliver Hogan, said a stake cut to \u00a32 \u201cwould not be nearly as detrimental as has been portrayed\u201d and could even be a \u201cnet boost to the economy\u201d. Bacta\u2019s chief executive, John White, said FOBTs were a \u201cdangerous anomaly\u201d in the gambling industry. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
