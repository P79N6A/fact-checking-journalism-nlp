      "bodyText": "Hundreds of poultry workers in Scotland are to lose their jobs due to the closure of a plant belonging to 2 Sisters Food Group, which has been dogged by a controversy over food standards. On Thursday, the UK\u2019s biggest supplier of supermarket chicken said it will shut the Cambuslang factory in South Lanarkshire in August. The site employs about 450 people. It comes after 2 Sisters said in February that 900 jobs were at risk as the company considered whether to close two West Midlands factories in Smethwick and Wolverhampton, plus Cambuslang. That announcement followed a nightmare year for the company, including a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation that prompted production to be suspended for five weeks last autumn at the group\u2019s West Bromwich plant. In a statement confirming the closure of Cambuslang, the company said: \u201cThis is not a decision we take lightly. Since day one, we have been very open on the big challenges the factory faces. \u201cIn fact, we have been trying extremely hard to reverse the position for a considerable period of time. We have invested several million pounds since 2014 and expanded by taking on more people, yet it is still a heavily lossmaking operation. \u201cWe have tried every turnaround option available to us for several years, ranging from cost-reduction measures to an attempt to grow the business organically. It has made little difference.\u201d The group said it was \u201ctrying hard to find openings both inside and outside the business, so we\u2019re hopeful compulsory redundancies can be kept to a minimum\u201d. It has previously said that alongside the factory closures, 2 Sisters has plans to create 915 jobs at other plants around the UK, including 250 at another Scotland factory in Coupar Angus. The undercover reports led to an investigation into 2 Sisters by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which highlighted \u201cseveral process weaknesses and regulatory failures\u201d. The footage shot at 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich chicken plant showed poultry being dropped on the floor and returned to the production line, as well as an instance of labels recording the slaughter dates of birds being changed. The company had claimed there was an innocent explanation for changing the labels, but the FSA report concluded: \u201cNo justification for this incident of label changes could be established.\u201d The chicken processor denied the film showed any food safety breaches and said it had temporarily suspended production at the factory because of process failures, adding that its \u201cinternal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "April traditionally marks the start of Britain\u2019s house-buying season. Once the daffodils come out, estate agents ready themselves for a rush of prospective buyers. Not this year, though. The body that represents estate agents, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says demand for housing has now fallen for 12 months. New buyer inquiries are down and that is having a knock-on effect in the mortgage market. A survey by the Bank of England of lenders shows a balance of 29% reporting a fall in demand for loans secured against property. Inevitably, a lack of activity means that house prices have stopped rising across the UK as a whole and in some parts of the country are actually falling. In London, the quarterly drop of almost 4% in the first three months of 2018 was the biggest since 2010. Just to be clear, this is not a national disaster: rather, the recent developments in the property market are inevitable and good. They show that even in the weird world of the UK property market \u2013 where demand is encouraged and supply restricted \u2013 the basic laws of economics sometimes operate. Demand for property is falling because asking prices are too high for buyers \u2013 even with interest rates at exceptionally low levels. Prices have been rising far faster than earnings and that has made it harder and harder for young people to get on to the property ladder. The house-price-to-earnings ratio needs to come down and a period of falling house prices makes that happen. That process is now under way as a result of squeezed living standards, less generous tax treatment for buy-to-let purchases and the prospect of higher interest rates that are all helping to prevent the cost of a home rising. For London specifically, there is also a Brexit effect. To be sure, estate agents are none too keen on the current state of affairs. Philip Hammond would probably like to see stronger housing market activity as well, since it would mean higher tax receipts. But the recurrent house price bubbles of the past four decades have not been good news for the economy. They have caused financial instability, distorted investment decisions and created intergenerational unfairness. Nobody in generation rent struggling to buy their first flat would think for a second that a period of falling prices was bad news. For Penny Mordaunt, it\u2019s a case of use it or lose it Penny Mordaunt has the easiest job in the cabinet \u2013 and the hardest. As the international development secretary, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about money because her department has been ringfenced against cuts since 2010 and Britain is one of only a handful of countries to devote the UN-recommended 0.7% of national income to aid. That\u2019s the easy bit. The difficult bit is that there is a sizeable \u2013 and vociferous \u2013 lobby that is opposed to Britain protecting aid spending when, at home, libraries are being closed, child benefit is being made less generous and the number of bobbies on the beat is dwindling. The rightwing press has long been calling for the Department for International Development (DfID) budget to be cut and it has been emboldened in recent weeks by the Haitian sex scandal that has engulfed Oxfam. Mordaunt knows that her department is under pressure to justify its spending as never before. In a speech on Thursday, she said voters needed to be convinced that the 0.7% of GDP could \u201cnot be better spent\u201d. Her plan involves using the aid budget to leverage in private sector investment into poor countries, with a particular focus on providing opportunities for British firms. Mordaunt wants UK pension funds to invest in Africa. There will also be greater collaboration between the DfID and other Whitehall departments. Inevitably, this led to a few raised eyebrows. It would certainly be a retrograde step were aid to be used primarily for Britain\u2019s own economic or defence ends, which is what some in the development community fear. There is no reason why this has to be the case. Private sector money is certainly going to be needed to finance Africa\u2019s immense infrastructure requirements. The DfID guarantees that enable ports to be built would be a good use of public money. And if the aid budget can facilitate exports of UK-built wind turbines to Ethiopia, both sides gain. The harsh truth is that there is no viable alternative to Mordaunt\u2019s approach. She can either protect her budget by giving it more of a British flavour or it will be whittled away. In the current difficult circumstances, that\u2019s the choice.",

      "bodyText": "Labour and the RMT union have warned the US private equity firm Apollo Global Management off pursuing its interest in the transport firm FirstGroup, after the British company rejected a takeover approach. FirstGroup, which operates UK rail franchises including Great Western and TransPennine Express, nearly 20% of local bus routes outside London and the US Greyhound coach service, said it had turned down a proposed cash bid from Apollo that it claimed \u201cfundamentally undervalues the company and is opportunistic in nature\u201d. It did not say how much Apollo had offered but its shares closed up more than 8% on Thursday after it disclosed the approach, taking its stock market value to \u00a31.3bn. Under UK takeover rules, Apollo, which owns companies including Claire\u2019s Accessories and the US restaurant chain Chuck E Cheese\u2019s, has until 9 May to make a firm offer or walk away. But Labour and the RMT indicated that Apollo would face fierce opposition, with scrutiny of takeovers particularly intense after the turnaround specialist Melrose\u2019s controversial, but ultimately successful, pursuit of engineer GKN. The shadow transport minister, Andy McDonald, criticised the government\u2019s handling of rail franchises after the bailout of Stagecoach and Virgin Rail on the East Coast line earlier this year. \u201cRail franchising is in chaos and has already cost the taxpayer billions of pounds in bailouts over the last year,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies know that the government will come to their rescue if they fail and are encouraged to take ever greater risks. \u201cThe last thing public transport in the UK needs is for FirstGroup to be taken over by a company that will aggressively cut costs and extract even greater profits at the expense of taxpayers and passengers.\u201d The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThis looks like another bunch of speculators and asset strippers homing in on the British transport sector. \u201cFirst have been propped up by the government on the Great Western routes for many years now and where this hostile bid leaves their UK bus and rail operations is anyone\u2019s guess. The only solution to this kind of uncertainty and instability is public ownership.\u201d Apollo declined to comment on its interest in FirstGroup. Analysts at stockbrokers Investec and Liberum Capital said Apollo could be looking to break up FirstGroup and sell off divisions to other buyers. But Liberum pointed to the political difficulty of such a plan. \u201cThe acquisition of a large UK employer providing essential services to the public by a foreign private equity fund seems unlikely to be welcomed in the current political environment,\u201d it said. \u201cEven before that, private equity ownership of rail franchises seem unlikely to be acceptable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Banks and building societies reined in their lending to consumers during the first three months of 2018 at the fastest rate since the the credit crunch, according to fresh figures from the Bank of England. The availability of unsecured loans to consumers between January and March slumped by the largest amount since records began in 2007, accelerating a trend seen through most of last year. Analysts said lenders had become more cautious in response to growing concern among regulators about rising levels of personal debt, in particular on credit cards, with lower demand also a factor. The survey by the Bank showed that consumer lending tightened by an aggregate of 38.7%, the largest fall on record and the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the Bank of England had warned that \u201cbanks risk becoming complacent in their lending behaviour so it should take some comfort from banks reportedly tightening their lending standards for granting unsecured consumer credit\u201d. The steep fall was partly due to a drop-off in approvals by lenders, with successful credit card applications down 26.2% and other forms of unsecured lending falling 13.2%. Banks\u2019 waning appetite for risk was combined with declining demand for loans, with credit cards again proving the major driver with a fall of 21.3%. Analysts at HSBC said: \u201cToday\u2019s survey shows that credit conditions are tightening in the UK, at least for the consumer. \u201cLenders are getting more cautious, perhaps as a consequence of the weaker consumer environment and slower economy, but perhaps also in response to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s [FCA] concerns about credit card debt.\u201d Earlier this year, the FCA responded to fears about rising debt with new rules designed to help people with consistently high levels of credit card debt. A decline in the demand for mortgages indicated continued weakness in the housing market, with home loan applications falling 29.3% in the first quarter. Analysts at Capital Economics said that mortgage lenders were also becoming more cautious, pointing to a balance of 19% of lenders reporting a fall in approved loan applications. \u201cThat was the highest reading seen in over five years, and suggests that tightening credit criteria may have had a meaningful effect on mortgage lending volumes,\u201d they said. But respondents to the survey said they expected a rebound in levels of mortgage lending in the coming quarter. The availability of credit to businesses was reported to be unchanged in the first quarter, with no change expected in the next three months.",

      "bodyText": "It is time to close the blog for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for all your comments and good-bye. Here\u2019s a quick summary of today\u2019s main developments. Global stock markets are rising after Donald Trump toned down his threats of missile strikes in Syria. British Airways owner IAG is considering an offer for Norwegian Air. London house prices are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender Halifax. Banks and building societies in Britain have tightened criteria for granting credit cards and loans, leading to a fall in unsecured lending in the first quarter, according to the Bank of England\u2019s latest credit conditions survey. Default rates have risen, however. In Europe, stock markets are also pushing higher. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 flat Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.83% France\u2019s CAC up 0.45% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.05% Spain\u2019s Ibex flat Wall Street has opened higher, on the back of expectations that lower US corporate taxes will boost company earnings alongside easing tensions over the Syria conflict. Dow Jones industrial average up 0.7% S&amp;P 500 up 0.55% Nasdaq up 0.6% Wall Street futures are edging higher, supported by expectations of strong corporate profits as the first-quarter earnings season gets under way and easing geopolitical tensions over Syria. Analysts are expecting quarterly profits at S&amp;P 500 companies to be 18.5% higher than a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. And in his latest tweet Donald Trump toned down his threats of military action in Syria. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2013 the west\u2019s leading economic think tank \u2013 has called on governments to use inheritance tax to reduce wealth inequality. European stock markets have ventured into positive territory, as tensions eased in the Middle East. Donald Trump sent a new tweet, saying a military strike against Syria after a suspected chemical weapons attack on civilians \u201ccould be very soon or not so soon at all\u201d. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.05% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.45% France\u2019s CAC up 0.25% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.77% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.06% Here is our full story on IAG\u2019s potential bid for low-cost carrier Norwegian. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK has had a closer look at Norwegian, which has undergone an \u201cexplosive growth path\u201d in the past few years - raising concerns that the airline might be overextending itself. In its most recent numbers Norwegian posted a bigger than expected net loss for the last three months of 2017 of $117m, down from a small profit a year before. Its rising costs in the form of new transatlantic routes has seen its costs rise quite sharply in recent years and expects to grow its capacity by 40% in 2018. Management plan to expand the fleet of operational aircraft to more than 190 planes by the end of 2019, from about 150 now, which when you consider the company only had 68 aircraft in 2012 is quite a sharp expansion. Its success in eating into the market share of its peers like Ryanair and Easyjet as well as forcing down prices on long haul routes has inevitably raised concerns that in a competitive market it could be getting ahead of itself. In a sign that it was having an effect in squeezing its competitors Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary, never one for holding back, claimed last September that Norwegian wouldn\u2019t survive the winter due to its ambitious expansion plans, and rising costs, prompting a withering response from Norwegian management that he was sore at losing his pilots to the rapidly expanding airline. We have seen in the past how over rapid expansion by accumulating too much debt can quickly get out of hand. Annual household savings in the UK have fallen to their lowest rate for a decade, according to the Office for National Statistics. The cash-based savings ratio fell to 0.9% in 2017, from 2.9% in 2016, the lowest it has been since 2008. There are different ways of measuring household savings. The latest national accounts saving ratio recorded an historic low of 4.9% in 2017, the ONS said. Charles Haresnape, chief executive of Gatehouse Bank, said: It is 2018 and yet, from a savings perspective, things are as bad in many respects as 2008. The fact that savings levels haven\u2019t been this low since the global financial crisis exploded a decade ago is a worrying sign. Rising prices have hit disposable income hard. Importantly, these ONS statistics reflect cash in purses and wallets, namely how people really feel about their spending and saving power on the ground. What they show is a marked deterioration that is unlikely to be offset by modest dips in inflation like the one we saw in February. Also weighing on people\u2019s minds will be house prices, which are not consistently keeping up with inflation. So many homeowners, emboldened to borrow by healthy rises in recent years, are all too aware now that their house is not the piggy bank it used to be. There\u2019s limited wiggle room to save and fewer reasons to borrow. The Bank of England said this morning that the amount of unsecured credit available to households fell significantly in the first quarter, as lenders tightened their credit scoring criteria for granting credit cards and personal loans. Meanwhile the availability of mortgages was unchanged in the three months to mid March, and is not expected to change in the next three months to mid-June, according to lenders polled by the central bank. The Bank\u2019s credit conditions survey also showed that demand for mortgages for house purchase has dropped significantly in the first quarter, although lenders expect a \u201cmarked pick-up in demand\u201d in the second quarter \u2013 the traditional spring selling season. Consumers also borrowed less on credit cards between January and March but sought more personal loans. Lenders expect this to reverse in the next quarter, anticipating an increase in credit card lending alongside a fall in other unsecured lending. Lenders reported no change in demand for corporate lending from businesses of all sizes. Default rates on mortgages continued to fall between January and March for the fourth quarter in a row, but rose on unsecured lending such as credit cards and personal loans, with a further slight increase expected in the three months to June. Norwegian Air has told Reuters that it did not know of IAG\u2019s interest until it saw the press reports on Thursday morning. The airline added that it has not held any discussions with IAG, and that the BA owner\u2019s interest confirms the potential of Norwegian\u2019s business model and its growth prospects. In other takeover news, Disney will have to make bid to take full control of Britain\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster even if the competition regulator quashes Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn for full control of Sky, the UK takeover panel has ruled. Our media business correspondent Mark Sweney writes: The owner of Walt Disney Studios has made a $66bn (\u00a349bn) bid to take over 21st Century Fox, which owns a 39% stake in Sky, and is awaiting the outcome of the UK competition regulator\u2019s verdict on whether to allow Murdoch to buy the 61% of Sky he does not already own. If the Competition and Markets Authority clears the bid and Disney is in turn allowed to complete its Fox deal, then Sky will come under the full ownership of the theme parks-to-films conglomerate. However, in December, Disney made a submission to the UK Takeover Panel, the city watchdog for corporate deals, saying that it did not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover of Sky if Rupert Murdoch fails to take full control. Under rule 9.1 of the takeover code, companies are normally forced to make an offer if they buy a stake of 30% or more. Disney argued that owning Sky was not a major driver of its overall Fox deal - which includes buying Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, the maker of films from X-Men to Deadpool - and so that rule should not apply. \u201cThe panel executive considers that securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney\u2019s acquiring control of Fox,\u201d the UK Takeover Panel said on Thursday. \u201cFollowing the acquisition by Disney of Fox, Disney will be required to make a mandatory offer to the holders of ordinary shares in Sky.\u201d The Takeover Panel said that if Disney is required to make a separate offer to take control of Sky then it will be at \u00a310.75 a share, the same price that Rupert Murdoch has tabled and has been accepted by Sky\u2019s directors. Analysts believe that Sky is undervalued - it is trading at \u00a313 a share - and could be valued at up to \u00a316 a share. The deal would greatly expand IAG\u2019s exposure to budget flying. Norwegian\u2019s shares have been suspended from trading on the Oslo stock exchange, after they soared as much as 28%. IAG, formed by the 2011 merger of Iberia and British Airways, bought Irish airline Aer Lingus in 2015 and Spanish budget carrier Vueling in 2013. The Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham wrote this piece about Norwegian a year ago: In response, IAG said that it is considering an offer for the low-cost carrier and has acquired a 4.6% stake in Norwegian Air. It added in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it has taken no decision to make an offer for Norwegian Air Shuttle at this time and that no discussions have taken place. Here is the statement: IAG considers Norwegian to be an attractive investment and has acquired a 4.61% ownership position in the airline (minority investment). The minority investment is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian. IAG confirms that no such discussions have taken place to date, that it has taken no decision to make an offer at this time and that there is no certainty that any such decision will be made. British Airways owner IAG is considering a bid for Norwegian Air, Bloomberg is reporting. The news sent Norwegian shares soaring by more than a quarter. They are now 14.3% ahead while IAG shares are down 1.7%, after falling as much as 3.4%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG, sums up the action so far on financial markets. \u2018Steady but cautious\u2019 is the best way to describe stock markets in Europe and the UK this morning. The British cabinet meets later to decide on military action, and the world is awaiting news of possible US strikes on Syria. As a result, it is hard to muster up the courage to keep chasing equities at present. Oil prices seem happy to consolidate around recent highs, awaiting further developments in the Syria situation. Fundamental news is going to have to do all the heavy lifting if the price is to rally further however \u2013 the size and rapidity of the move from last summer\u2019s lows means that positioning is now all on the long side, with little sign of fresh money flowing in to drive the price higher. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 24,205, 16 points higher from yesterday\u2019s close. Theresa May has recalled ministers from their Easter break for a special cabinet meeting on how to respond to what she has described as a barbaric poison gas attack by Syrian government forces on civilians in Douma, east of the capital Damascus. Ministers will discuss whether to join the US and France in a possible military attack on Syria that would bring western and Russian forces into direct conflict for the first time in the seven-year-old civil war. Syria\u2019s main ally Russia said it had deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces. The RIA news agency quoted Russia\u2019s defence ministry as saying: They are the guarantors of law and order in the region. Sterling is flat against the dollar at $1.4173 following its recent rally, to $1.4223 on Wednesday, as traders wait for more data that should help shape expectations of a Bank of England interest rate hike next month. Britain\u2019s manufacturing and construction sectors posted surprise declines in February, pointing to an economic slowdown in the first quarter of this year. One of Britain\u2019s leading forecasting bodies, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, is predicting that GDP growth halved to 0.2% between January and March from 0.4% at the end of last year, while several City analysts are expecting an easing to 0.3% growth. Key UK data on inflation and the labour market will be released next week. European stock markets are broadly flat, as traders await more news on the conflict in Syria, and on the trade spat between the US and China. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.06% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.06% France\u2019s CAC down 0.06% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.27% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.02% Oil prices have eased slightly but remain high after Brent crude soared above $73 a barrel on Wednesday, the highest since late 2014. Brent is currently trading at $71.91 a barrel, while US crude is at $66.74 a barrel. Russian stocks and the rouble have recovered somewhat, after heavy sell-offs following the announcement of new US sanctions on Friday and despite rising tensions in the Middle East, with Donald Trump warning of missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack. The rouble tumbled 2.5% to a two-year low of 65.06 against the dollar on Trump\u2019s tweet on Wednesday, but has since stabilised and is now trading at 62.33, up 0.4%. Against the euro, the rouble gained 1% to 76.65 after touching 80.50 on Wednesday, a level last seen in March 2016. Russia\u2019s finance ministry put purchases of foreign currency for its reserves on hold this week to avoid extra pressure on the rouble. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market rose 2.3% while the rouble-based MOEX index was down 1.3%. House prices in London are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to a regional survey from Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Prices in the capital fell 3.2% in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the depths of the financial crisis. London also recorded the sharpest fall in annual house prices since the start of 2011. Compared with the first quarter in 2017, property values declined by 3.8% following a 0.7% annual drop in the fourth quarter. The south east only saw a small annual increase in prices, of 0.3%, while the south west posted inflation of 1.9%. Elsewhere, prices grew strongly. The East Midlands and East Anglia recorded the strongest rates of annual price inflation, of 7.3% and 7.2% respectively, followed by Scotland at 6.7% and Yorkshire &amp; Humberside at 6.1%. Fellow British retailer Dunelm which sells bedding and kitchen equipment, has fared better. The homewares chain reported 4.6% growth in like-for-like sales in the third quarter, driven by a 36% surge in online sales. Its shares rose 8% on the news. In corporate news, Carpetright, the struggling UK carpet retailer, said it would seek approval from creditors for a restructuring plan to close 92 of its stores, with the likely loss of 300 jobs, and reduce rent at 113. It has 434 shops and concessions across Britain. The company also hopes to raise \u00a360m from shareholders through a placing and open offer to reduce debts and fund its restructuring plan. It has issued a series of profit warnings in recent months, one of many highstreet retailers that are struggling as consumers are cautious about their spending. Carpetright will seek creditor approval at a meeting on 26 April for the company voluntary arrangement which will allow it to close shops and lower rents, before asking shareholders for their support on 30 April. The company\u2019s shares plunged more than 16% in early trading. Britain\u2019s property surveyors have issued the most downbeat assessment of the housing market for five years. The monthly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed that in March demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row, new instructions from sellers declined for the seventh consecutive month, and prices were flat nationally. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has rejected the idea of a new super-committee charged with overseeing the economy and the financial system. He said merging the monetary and financial policy committees \u2013 as proposed by some politicians \u2013 would make decision-making too complicated and raise the risk of the kind of mistakes made before the financial crisis. In the text of a speech he was due to give via video link to a conference at Australia\u2019s central bank in Sydney, he argued for the separation of powers. Apart from anything else the policymaking process would be far too complicated to hold any one bit of it to account and the all-powerful policymaker would naturally tend to focus on the more verifiable tasks. A bit like the man who loses his keys in the park but looks for them under the streetlamp \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the light is\u201d the attention of policy would be directed to the most observable objectives. Perhaps we collectively fell foul of this trap, in some ways, ahead of the crisis. The risk of a rare event is not an easy thing to judge and, having gone so long without a serious problem in the financial system, our attention was distracted by the more easily monitored task of stabilising the economic cycle. And we\u2019re off. Germany\u2019s Dax, Spain\u2019s Ibex and the FTSE 100 index in London are flat while France\u2019s CAC has edged up 0.1%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices soared to their highest levels since December 2014, above $73 a barrel last night. Brent crude futures are at $72.30, still the highest in more than three years. Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that missiles \u201cwill be coming\u201d in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical attack in Douma near the Syrian capital. Both Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility. Trump\u2019s comments raised the prospect of direct conflict between the two world powers backing opposing sides for the first time in the seven-year-old civil war. Hidenori Suezawa, financial market analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Reuters: Last year Russia and Syria did not shoot back against US missiles. But this time the scale of possible attacks by the US and possibly its allies seems larger if Russia fires back, the war front will be bigger. I don\u2019t think we are heading into World War III but should there be a direct collision between the US and Russia for the first time, that\u2019s the sort of headline that would plunge stock prices. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said oil prices are also under pressure from developments in Saudia Arabia and Yemen. With nerves already frayed sentiment wasn\u2019t helped by reports that Saudi Arabian defence systems had intercepted a number of missiles fired from Yemen, over the skies of Riyadh, which in turn saw oil prices hit their highest levels since December 2014 above $73. UK prime minister Theresa May insisted that the chemical weapons attack on Douma \u201ccannot go unchallenged\u201d. She has not ruled out committing the UK to join a coordinated military intervention in Syria without consulting MPs. The Russian rouble steadied on Wednesday after two days of heavy losses amid mounting concerns over the Syrian conflict and new US sanctions. It closed down around 62.59 to the dollar, still down more than 7% so far this week. Stock futures are pointing to a flat or lower open in Europe. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei edged down 0.2% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 0.7%. On Wall Street, stocks also closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.55% while the Dow Jones lost 0.9%. Minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting on 20-21 March released on Wednesday showed all of its policymakers thought the economy would improve further and that inflation would rise in coming months, suggesting a June rate hike remains on the table.

Rising prices have hit disposable income hard.

      "bodyText": "EDF Energy has become the second of the big six energy suppliers to raise prices this week, announcing a 1.4% increase for more than a million customers. The French state-owned supplier will raise dual fuel bills for 1.3m customers on standard variable tariffs, increasing the average bill by \u00a316 to \u00a31,158. The increase is relatively modest compared to the above-inflation 5.5% rise that British Gas announced on Tuesday, triggering government criticism. Comparison sites said the move by British Gas had paved the way for other suppliers to put up prices, and urged households to switch. \u201cClearly the price rise from British Gas earlier this week has opened the floodgates and we\u2019re now officially in price rise season,\u201d said Stephen Murray, at price comparison site MoneySuperMarket. EDF blamed the rise on a significant increase wholesale energy costs, as well as government policies such as clean energy subsidies, which have to be paid through energy bills. It said the rollout of smart meters, a government policy carried out by energy suppliers, had also contributed. B\u00e9atrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: \u201cWe know that price rises are not welcome and we have worked to offset rising energy and policy charges by cutting our own costs.\u201d The firm added that 59% of its customers would not be affected, limiting the rise to 1.3m households, because they are on fixed or protected tariffs. The increase comes ahead of the government\u2019s plans for a price cap on standard variable tariffs, but that is not expected to take effect until the end of the year. While relatively small compared to British Gas in terms of customer numbers, EDF is a big player in UK electricity generation. The government has guaranteed the company twice the current wholesale cost of power for electricity from the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which EDF hopes to complete by 2025, a timetable experts said this week was in doubt because of problems at a similar French plant.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of British Airways has said it is considering making a bid for rival airline Norwegian, amid fierce competition between the two for transatlantic passengers. International Airlines Group (IAG), formed via the 2010 merger of BA with Spanish flag-carrier Iberia, said it had built up a stake of 4.6% in Norwegian, and that it sees the rapidly expanding airline as an \u201cattractive investment\u201d. In a statement to the stock market, IAG said: \u201cThe minority investment is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian.\u201d Norwegian\u2019s shares soared on the back of IAG\u2019s interest, a 47% rise taking its stock market value above \u00a3900m on the Oslo exchange. Shares in IAG closed down just over 1% on the news. The company said it did not know of IAG\u2019s interest until press reports on Thursday morning and had not held any discussions with IAG. It added that the BA owner\u2019s interest confirms the potential of Norwegian\u2019s business model and its growth prospects. Norwegian has proved a thorn in BA\u2019s side of late, launching low-cost transatlantic routes and picking up new landing slots at Gatwick as part of aggressive expansion plans. Norwegian launched its transatlantic service from UK and Ireland last year with some fares as low as \u00a369 one-way, although that excluded reserved seat, onboard food, or checked baggage. Norwegian is the fastest-growing major transatlantic carrier, with scheduled capacity for summer 2018 of more than 1.5 million passengers, an 87% increase on last year, according to data compiled for the Guardian by flight data firm OAG. Norwegian has typically been able to undercut traditional airlines by offering passengers the option to forgo services such as reserved seats, an inflight meal and checked baggage. BA responded this week by launching its own long-haul no-frills options, while it has also launched a new transatlantic service flying out of Barcelona, called Level. John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said an IAG takeover of Norwegian made sense given the growing rivalry. \u201cIAG has been proactive in response to Norwegian\u2019s growth by competing in a number of ways including putting more seats on BA\u2019s [Boeing] 777s out of Gatwick, setting up Level and using Aer Lingus via Dublin. \u201cNorwegian is also not financially strong, they made a loss last year and have warned of a larger than anticipated first-quarter loss. \u201cThey\u2019ve got significant numbers of aircraft on order and there\u2019s a lot of industry conjecture about the sustainability of the airline\u2019s model considering the ambitious growth.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, predicted last year that Norwegian wouldn\u2019t survive the winter due to its ambitious growth plans and rising costs. The suggestion drew a fierce riposte from Norwegian\u2019s management, who accused O\u2019Leary of being annoyed at losing his pilots to the rapidly expanding airline. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh has been more complimentary about Norwegian\u2019s tactics, said Strickland. \u201cWalsh has said that Norwegian has proved there\u2019s a market for low-cost long-haul \u2013 and has generated new traffic rather than cannibalising what\u2019s there already,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come up against each other more often so IAG probably see a chance to manage that in a more controlled fashion.\u201d Michael Hewson, of spreadbetting firm CMC Markets, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s news [of bid interest] suggests that IAG feels that there is an opportunity here given the level of the share price, or it could simply be keeping its options open in the event of further difficulties [at Norwegian]. Time will tell.\u201d When IAG was formed, Walsh said he had a shopping list of at least 10 airlines he believed the group could buy in order to expand. Since then, he has struck deals to take over just three: Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling; British regional airline BMI; and Aer Lingus, the Irish airline where Walsh served as chief executive before moving to British Airways. If IAG goes ahead with a bid for Norwegian, it could be forced to pay something close to its largest acquisition, the \u00a31.2bn deal for Aer Lingus completed in 2015.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Disney will have to make a full takeover bid for Sky even if the competition regulator quashes Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn attempt to buy 100% of Britain\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster, the UK takeover panel has ruled. The owner of Walt Disney Studios has made a $66bn (\u00a349bn) bid to take over 21st Century Fox, which owns a 39% stake in Sky. Meanwhile, it is awaiting the outcome of the UK competition regulator\u2019s verdict on whether to allow Murdoch to buy the 61% of Sky he does not already own \u2013 a deal that was well in train before the Disney transaction. If the Competition and Markets Authority clears Murdoch\u2019s bid and Disney is in turn allowed to complete its Fox deal, then Sky will come under the full ownership of the theme parks-to-films conglomerate. However, in December Disney turned its attention to an alternative scenario should Murdoch\u2019s bid for Sky fail. It made a submission to the UK takeover panel, the city watchdog for corporate deals, saying it did not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover of Sky if Rupert Murdoch failed to take full control. Under rule 9.1 of the takeover code, companies are normally forced to make an offer if they buy a stake of 30% or more.

      "bodyText": "House prices in London are falling at the fastest rate in nine years, according to Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Prices in the capital were down 3.2% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the sharpest decline since the depths of the financial crisis, according to regional data collated by IHS Markit and published by Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group. London also recorded the sharpest fall in annual house prices since the start of 2011. Property values fell 3.8% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 0.7% annual drop in the fourth quarter. London prices have been falling on a quarterly and annual basis since the third quarter of 2017. There was a small annual increase of 0.3% in prices in the south-east of England at the start of the year, and a rise of 1.9% in the south-west. Prices grew strongly elsewhere in the country. The east Midlands and East Anglia recorded the fastest rates of annual price inflation, at 7.3% and 7.2% respectively, followed by Scotland at 6.7% and Yorkshire and the Humber at 6.1%. The standardised price of a home in London was \u00a3430,749 in the first quarter, the lowest since the end of 2015. Figures are standardised in order to track the price of a \u201ctypical house\u201d by giving values to certain attributes of the properties and using them to calculate the price. The figure for the south-east was \u00a3337,776, a one-year low. Such prices are still far above the average UK figure of \u00a3223,819. Apart from London and the south-east, only the south-west and East Anglia remain above the national figure at \u00a3237,371 and \u00a3236,335 respectively. Average house prices are lowest in Northern Ireland at \u00a3127,793, Scotland at \u00a3145,837 and the north of England at \u00a3146,648. Across the UK, house prices stalled in the first quarter. Paul Smith, IHS Markit\u2019s economics director, said: \u201cThe subdued performance of the UK housing market, especially in the south of England, seems to reflect a general lack of appetite amongst households at present for activity related to major purchases in line with the general squeeze on real incomes seen in recent months. \u201cAllied with a general undercurrent of Brexit-related uncertainty, plus the likelihood of higher \u2013 albeit still historically low \u2013 interest rates later in the year, the market seems set to persist in a subdued state for the foreseeable future.\u201d The figures came as Britain\u2019s property surveyors gave their most downbeat assessment of the housing market for five years. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row in March, new instructions from sellers declined for the seventh consecutive month and prices were flat nationally. One surveyor, Toby Whittome of Jackson-Stops in London, said stamp duty increases and Brexit had \u201ckilled the fluidity of the London market\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carpetright has confirmed plans to close 92 stores, with the potential loss of 300 jobs, in a restructuring process designed to stave off administration. Shares in the UK\u2019s biggest carpet retailer fell sharply 16% to 35p as the company said it wanted to move out of almost a quarter of its 409 stores in September. It will also be asking landlords for rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 more sites under a company voluntary arrangement, a process designed to stave off insolvency and which must be approved by its creditors. Completion of the CVA will be dependent on Carpetright also raising \u00a360m in new funds from shareholders in order to reduce debt and cover the cost of the restructure. It also needs to secure \u00a315m in short-term funding from its banks to cover immediate costs. Carpetright, which has a UK workforce of 2,700, has issued a series of profit warnings in recent months, sending its shares sharply lower. The company said the closures were necessary to \u201crestore the viability of the group\u2019s business model\u201d as it struggles to survive amid a slowdown in the housing market and a squeeze on consumer spending which has dampened demand for expensive household goods. It has also faced increasing competition, particularly from the Tapi chain set up by Carpetright\u2019s founder, Lord Harris, and his son. Harris left Carpetright in 2014. Several major retailers have fallen into financial difficulty as they battle with rising costs, from business rates and an increase in the legal minimum wage, as well as a shift towards online shopping. Carpetright\u2019s troubles come a few weeks after fashion chain New Look, advised by Deloitte which is also advising the carpet retailer, won approval for a CVA that involves the closure of up to 60 of its 593 stores and rent reductions on dozens more. The baby goods retailer Mothercare is thought to be considering a similar move while Toys R Us pushed through a CVA before going bust earlier this year. The toy retailer said on Thursday it would close its remaining 75 stores by 24 April with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs. Carpetright said trading \u201cremained difficult\u201d and it expected to make a small loss for the year to the end of April. The company intends to provide further detail a few days after creditors vote on the CVA proposal on 26 April. Wilf Walsh, the chief executive of Carpetright, said: \u201cThese tough but necessary actions will enable us to address the burden of a legacy UK property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on unsustainable rents and are essential if we are to restore our profitability and deliver a successful turnaround.\u201d He said that getting rid of unwanted stores, most of which were signed up on 25-year leases in 1990s and early 2000s under previous management, would enable Carpetright to focus on improving the service and environment in its remaining outlets. \u201cCompletion of the CVA and equity financing will enable us to establish an appropriately sized estate of modernised stores on economic rents, complemented with a compelling online offer, enabling Carpetright to address the competitive threat from a position of strength.\u201d Walsh said he was \u201ccommitted to the project\u201d of seeing the turnaround through. \u201cI don\u2019t think now would be the time to bail,\u201d he said.",

In retail, this usually involves asking landlords of poorly performing shops to reduce rental payments or allow the company to exit leases on stores which they would otherwise be bound to for long periods. </p>\n    <p>Companies hire an insolvency practitioner to assess the business and whether a CVA has a reasonable chance of success. They then produce a CVA proposal which may involve changes to the terms of leases or termination of onerous supply or employment contracts.</p>\n    <p>In order for a CVA to go ahead, the company must call a meeting of unsecured creditors, which may include suppliers and landlords. For the CVA to be approved, creditors who are owed at least 75% of the company\u2019s total unsecured debt must vote in favour. At least 50% of creditors who voted for the CVA must not be connected to the company.</p>\n    <p>Once approved, the company can continue trading as usual and all unsecured creditors are bound by the deal, even those who voted against it or didn\u2019t vote at all. </p>\n    <p>Creditors are often willing to support a CVA in the hope of recovering more cash than they would if the company went into administration or liquidation. They hope that reducing debts will help create a viable company that can continue to trade and pay them.</p>\n    <p>The process is popular with managers because they usually remain in charge of the company and it is cheaper than other forms of insolvency.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said that getting rid of unwanted stores, most of which were signed up on 25-year leases in 1990s and early 2000s under previous management, would enable Carpetright to focus on improving the service and environment in its remaining outlets.</p> \n<p> \u201cCompletion of the CVA and equity financing will enable us to establish an appropriately sized estate of modernised stores on economic rents, complemented with a compelling online offer, enabling Carpetright to address the competitive threat from a position of strength.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walsh said he was \u201ccommitted to the project\u201d of seeing the turnaround through. \u201cI don\u2019t think now would be the time to bail,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s property surveyors have issued the most downbeat assessment of the housing market for five years. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that in March demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row, new instructions from sellers declined for the seventh consecutive month, and prices were flat nationally. Rics measures confidence in the property market by balancing surveyors seeing price rises against those seeing price falls. It said the figures were the lowest since 2013. The latest Rics survey is in sharp contrast to figures earlier this week from Halifax which revealed a spike in prices. \u201cAt the national level the price balance remained unchanged coming in at zero, representing the joint lowest reading since February 2013,\u201d said the Rics survey. The downshift is deepest in London and the south-east of England, said Rics, but prices were still rising in parts of the Midlands and north. \u201cLondon exhibits the weakest feedback, with a net balance of -47% of respondents citing further price declines. Respondents in the south-east, East Anglia and north-east, also reported prices to be falling but to a lesser extent than in the capital. Meanwhile, prices continue to drift higher across all other parts of the UK, with Northern Ireland, Wales and the East Midlands seeing the strongest readings.\u201d Surveyors in the south said Brexit and stamp duty were behind the fall in prices. \u201cStamp duty and Brexit have killed the fluidity of the London market. Only when the extent of the resulting economic damage is properly understood will things be able to change for the better,\u201d said Toby Whittome, of Jackson Stops, in London. Rics said the reversal in the property market could prompt the Bank of England to delay the next rise in interest rates. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics\u2019 chief economist, said: \u201cThe latest Rics results provide little encouragement that the drop in housing market activity is likely to be reversed any time soon. It has the potential to impact the wider economy contributing to a softer trend in household spending. \u201cThis could make Bank of England deliberations around a May hike in interest rates, which is pretty much odds-on at the moment, a little more finely balanced than would otherwise be the case.\u201d Predictions that rents would rise following the introduction of greater taxation on buy-to-lets have yet to materialise, with tenant demand weak in many parts of the country. In Guildford, Surrey, Tony Jamieson, of the estate agents Clarke Gammon, said: \u201cThere has been an increase in properties available for rent and no increase in tenant demand, so rent values are falling, and we expect this trend to continue.\u201d But in Woverhampton, Andrew Pearce, of Millennium Properties, said: \u201cDemand is at an all-time high but supply is dwindling with tax changes, stamp duty and soon agents being unable to charge for essential reference searches. A crucial sector of the housing market is being badly led \u2013 to the detriment of landlords and tenants.\u201d",
