Buyers and sellers opted to \u201cwait and see\u201d ahead of today\u2019s election according to estate agents surveyed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Enquiries from new buyers fell and the number of properties placed on the market dropped for a 15th month. The number of sales agreed also fell. \u201cSurveyors up and down the UK are observing on the ground what many others in the industry suspect; those who need to move are doing so, and those who are seriously considering it are just \u2018holding off\u2019 for a few weeks and then, regardless of the election result, are likely to get on with it,\u201d said Brian Murphy, head of lending at Mortgage Advice Bureau. A shortage of properties coming onto the market was reflected in a separate report from Halifax, which said a lack of supply helped to drive the first rise in house prices in five months in May. The average price of a home increased by 0.4% last month to \u00a3220,706, according to the lender. It was the first monthly rise in house prices since the beginning of 2017 and surprised City economists, who had forecast a 0.1% fall. Economists expect the housing market to weaken this year, as the impact of the Brexit vote weighs on the economy. Inflation is already rising at a faster pace than wages, putting pressure on household finances. However, house prices are expected to rise in 2017, albeit at a more modest pace than the 6.5% increase reported by Halifax in 2016. \u201cWhile the days of rapid house price growth fuelled by sharp increases in leverage are over, we still see scope for prices to edge up over the rest of 2017,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cMay\u2019s Halifax data should allay concerns that house prices are on a downward spiral.\u201d Annual house price growth of 3.3% in May was the weakest in four years according to the Halifax measure, and well below the recent peak of 10% in March 2016. Prices fell by 0.2% over the past three months. Martin Ellis, a housing economist at Halifax, said Britain\u2019s property shortage would continue to support house price growth. \u201cThe fact that the supply of new homes and existing properties available for sale remains low, combined with historically low mortgage rates and a high employment rate, is likely to support house price levels over the coming months,\u201d he said. Rics also reported a rise in UK houses prices in May, but at a slower pace. A balance of +17% estate agents reported a rise, down from +22% in April. Prices fell in central London. Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at Rics, described the May survey of estate agents as \u201cominous\u201d. \u201cContributors still expect house prices to increase at a faster pace than wages over the medium term despite the difficulty many first time buyers are clearly having in taking their first steps onto the property ladder. \u201cThe increasingly tight second hand market remains a cause for concern with the Rics series tracking new instructions to agents recording its fifteenth successive negative reading. It is hard to see this as anything other a major obstacle to the efficient functioning of the housing market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s GDP in March continued to grow but also continued to grow weakly. It is a situation that we have become all too accustomed to and reflects the state of the economy where, because of the shift from mining investment to exports, a massive jump in profits no longer translates into a boost for wages or jobs. In March Australia\u2019s GDP increased by 0.3% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 in line with expectations and sharply down on the 1.1% growth recorded in the December quarter last year: And while this growth is welcome, we really should not get too caught up in claims of some record run without a recession. Not only, as I pointed out on Tuesday, is there no such record, it also disguises the fact that growth at the moment is pathetic. Australia\u2019s economy has grown by just 1.7% in the past 12 months \u2013 half of what is now considered the long-term average of 2.75%. The picture for GDP per capita growth is even worse. In seasonally adjusted terms, it fell in March by 0.1% \u2013 the third fall in the past two years. In the past year GDP per capita grew by just 0.2%, the worst growth since the GFC and at a level historically associated with a recession: If you do want to talk records, here\u2019s one. In the past 18 quarters, Australia\u2019s annual GDP growth has never been above 3% \u2013 the longest such run since the ABS began calculating quarterly GDP in 1959: In the past nine years there have only been four quarters where annual GDP growth has been above 3% \u2013 a growth rate that used to be considered merely average. And we can no longer find succour from comparing ourselves with the rest of the world. Three months ago when talking up the GDP figures, Scott Morrison boasted that Australia\u2019s economy was growing faster than any of the G7 nations. Well no longer. Our growth now lags behind the UK, US and Canada and well back in the pack of all OECD nations: The reason for the growth is also not particularly invigorating. The largest contributor in the March quarter was \u201cchange in inventories\u201d. This is essentially companies building up their stocks. This was mostly done by the mining sector, which, as the treasurer noted, was largely due to their taking advantage of a spike in mineral prices by running down stock in December and thus in March they built them up again. That\u2019s not a bad sign but, as the treasurer also noted, it often cancels out the impact of exports \u2013 the volume of which actually fell in March: This is always the problem with having an economy that derives a large amount of growth from exports \u2013 it is erratic: The other big drag on the economy in March was dwelling construction \u2013 reducing GDP growth in March by 0.2% points. The housing construction boom is over: The biggest driver of growth over the past year was household consumption. And while that is not unusual, the reasons highlight why we have such weak growth at the moment. With real wages falling and the total number of hours worked growing by just 0.5% over the past year, it is somewhat surprising that household consumption continues to bolster GDP growth. But we are spending not because we are flush with cash but because we are eating into our savings. The savings ratio is now back to levels not seen since the GFC hit: But despite the large drop in our savings rate since 2011, the growth rate of our spending has not risen \u2013 it remains at a historically low 2.4%: This is also observed through the disconnect of wages with nominal GDP growth. Weak nominal GDP growth has been the bane of governments since the GFC hit. Nominal GDP growth is generally linked to tax revenue better than is real GDP growth. And, in the past six months, nominal GDP growth has taken off \u2013 up 7.7% over the past year. The reason has been the surge in exports prices \u2013 which has seen the terms of trade grow a stunning 25% over the past year. But his boom of income is not being felt by workers \u2013 while nominal GDP is spiking, wages growth is falling: Essentially all the surge in nominal GDP is going to profits. Corporate gross operating surplus (as good proxy for profits) rose 20.1% in the past year \u2013 the best growth for eight years. But wages are not responding: The big jump in profits is mostly going to the mining sector \u2013 a sector where employment is down 12% on where it was five years ago. Thus whereas during the mining boom years the big mining profits led to job growth and big wages that then filtered through the economy, that is not happening this time. In fact real labour costs in the past year fell 6% \u2013 the biggest one-year fall in history: For all the talk of a record run without a recession, the reality is such records don\u2019t pay the bills. We have had a record period in this country without a recession and yet we also have wages growing at levels that you normally would associate with a recession. Yes it has been a long time since Australia experienced a recession. But it is now close to a decade since we also experienced consistent strong growth of the type that leads to strong jobs and wages growth \u2013 and there is little in these figures to suggest that situation is about to change.

The extra \u00a31bn is how much Fred Goodwin\u2019s successors have spent settling and fighting claims from irate retail investors who thought the rights issue document was misleading. The latest settlement with RBS Action Group, worth about \u00a3200m, will probably bring an end to the process. One can\u2019t yet say so definitively, because some claimants outside the group haven\u2019t formally accepted, so the judge left the door ajar for a trial. But the diehards have only limited time in which to demonstrate they have the funds to continue, so a revival of proceedings is a long shot. Goodwin and three other former RBS directors can breathe more easily. They probably aren\u2019t going to be called as witnesses. The current chief executive of RBS, Ross McEwan, will also be relieved. He has made no secret of the fact that he regards the legal claim as a huge distraction from his day job of trying to improve RBS\u2019s fortunes. Fine, but he should try putting himself in the claimants\u2019 shoes. Most are small shareholders, and some are employees of RBS who were encouraged by former management to invest. The bank\u2019s abrasive tone with the claimants, and its seemingly freewheeling approach to racking up legal fees (a cool \u00a3100m), have felt completely wrong. \u201cWe have been very clear that putting our legacy issues behind us is a priority,\u201d said RBS as it described the settlement as a positive outcome. It may feel like a legacy issue for McEwan \u2013 but it\u2019s a hideous phrase to use when folk less wealthy than him are still living with the financial consequences of the UK\u2019s biggest banking catastrophe. Santander deal looks better for the regulators than for the buyer Ana Bot\u00edn, chair of Santander, will be the toast of Frankfurt and Brussels. A small, but potentially nasty, crisis has been averted by the bank agreeing to buy the \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d Banco Popular, Spain\u2019s sixth largest lender, for a nominal euro. For the European Central Bank and the newish Single Resolution Board, it\u2019s a useful demonstration that a redesigned system for dispatching weak banks can do the job. Popular\u2019s shareholders and holders of its riskiest class of bonds get wiped out, which is what\u2019s meant to happen, and a troubled bank ends up in the arms of a stronger owner. Depositors are unaffected, no public money is involved, and everybody can move on. It would be harder to perform the trick in, say, Italy, where bondholders tend to be retail savers, but never mind, the Spanish example sets a good precedent that holders of lower-class IOUs can lose all their capital when a bank is in distress. Their CoCo, or contingent convertible capital, paper is called loss-absorbing for a reason. The harder part to understand, however, is why Santander is so willing to play along. It\u2019s true that, on paper, the numbers can be made to add up. Santander is raising \u20ac7bn (\u00a361bn) via a rights issue to cover a \u20ac7.9bn provision for even more write-offs on Popular\u2019s troubled book of property loans. The prize at the end of the process is commanding market shares in Spain and Portugal, especially in lending to small businesses, and the chance to remove \u20ac500m from the combined cost base. The deal is expected to generate a return on investment of 13%-14% in 2020, says Santander. Will it really, though? A couple of big assumptions are being made. First, that Santander, without time to conduct a full examination, has a proper grasp on the awfulness of Popular\u2019s property loans. Second, that removing \u20ac500m of overheads from Popular will mean only a modest loss of customers. Both gambles could come good, especially if the Spanish economy continues to recover. Even so, on day one, this deal looks far better for the regulators than for the buyer. For Santander shareholders, the critical piece of information is the one they will not get: did Bot\u00edn jump to buy Popular, or was she pushed by the banking authorities? WPP is lucky \u2013 shareholders are usually far more revolting At most FTSE 100 companies, a 21% vote against the remuneration report would be a cause of embarrassment. At advertising giant WPP, a one-fifth rebellion counts as a decent result. The shareholders are usually far more revolting. The chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s pay packet fell from \u00a370m in 2015 to \u201conly\u201d \u00a348m last year, but that hardly explains the relative contentment. Rather, the shareholders were ambushed by WPP\u2019s promise in 2013 that the extravagant incentive scheme would be dismantled. But the new arrangements don\u2019t arrive until next year. During the transition period, Sorrell\u2019s winnings have been enormous, even for a successful public company. He played the long game on pay \u2013 and won.",

      "bodyText": "Rising inflation and weak wage growth will leave Britain rooted to the bottom of the league table for living standards among the west\u2019s richest countries in 2018, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. In the last piece of economic news before the general election, the Paris-based thinktank said the next government would spend the first 18 months of the next parliamentary term presiding over a severe squeeze on real incomes. The OECD said inflation at 2.7% during 2018 would dwarf wage growth of 1.5% and result in the UK have the weakest real income performance, alongside Finland, of any of its 34 rich member states. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said it was alarming that UK workers would face the biggest real wage fall of any advanced economy in 2018, while other OECD members, with the exception of Italy and Mexico, would experience real wage increases in 2018. She said: \u201cBoosting wages has to be a top priority for whoever gets the keys to Downing Street. British workers still haven\u2019t recovered from the last financial crisis. The last thing they can afford is another hit on their finances.\u201d The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has predicted a tentative recovery for the global economy this year and next but warned of risks from fragile trust in government, weak wage growth and persistent inequality. In its latest health check on growth prospects, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development described the outlook for the global economy almost a decade on from the financial crash as \u201cbetter, but not good enough\u201d. The Paris-based organisation nudged up its forecasts for global growth this year. But it trimmed its outlook for the US, to show growth accelerating a little more gently than in its previous assessment in March. The OECD made no changes to previous predictions that the UK will suffer a Brexit-related slowdown, with growth easing from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.6% this year and just 1% in 2018. But after being a strong supporter of austerity measures to curb Britain\u2019s budget deficit after the end of the 2008-09 recession, the thinktank said it was time for a different approach. \u201cThe budget deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged this year, but fiscal consolidation is planned for 2018 despite a weaker growth outlook. Instead, further fiscal initiatives to increase public investment should be considered to support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term,\u201d it said. Labour seized on the report as evidence of OECD backing for its proposal to bolster public borrowing for investment by \u00a3250bn over the next decade. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the thinktank\u2019s conclusion was \u201ca hammer blow for the Tories\u2019 economic credibility\u201d. He added: \u201cThe OECD\u2019s call for increased investment in our economy is a ringing endorsement of Labour\u2019s economic policy in this election, and shows the clear choice voters have on Thursday.\u201d Referring to the UK\u2019s decline in GDP growth in the past six months, Catherine Mann, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, said recent data had been poor and the benefit of the lower pound for exporters was offset by inflationary pressures from higher import prices hitting disposable incomes. \u201cWe are concerned about the purchasing power for consumers in an environment where the pass through [from higher import prices] seems pretty robust,\u201d she said. After 3% growth in 2016, the global economy is expected to expand by 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018. That compares with previous forecasts of 3.3% and 3.6% respectively. \u201cAfter many years of weak recovery, with global growth in 2016 at the lowest rate since 2009, some signs of improvement have begun to appear,\u201d Mann wrote in the OECD\u2019s latest outlook report. After June\u2019s EU referendum result, the OECD was, like many forecasters, forced to backtrack on its warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from the Brexit vote. Its latest outlook noted there was support for UK growth from low interest rates and from planned spending cuts being pushed back. But echoing recent signs that consumers have become more cautious, the group said the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the Brexit vote had pushed up inflation, denting household income growth and household spending. It also warned business investment would decline sharply, amid continuing uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU.",

      "bodyText": "It was a down day for European shares ahead of Thursdays key events, the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u2019s testimony. A slide in the euro unnerved European stocks while conversely, a strong pound helped push the FTSE 100 lower. Energy and commodity companies were also under pressure after a slide in the oil price following a surprise jump in US crude stocks. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 46.33 points or 0.62% at 7478.62 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.14% to 12,672.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.07% lower at 5265.53 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.1% to 20,739.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.07% at 10,871.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.42% to 774.29 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 7 points or 0.04%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with the oil price reaction to the surprise rise in US crude stocks: The pound rose to a two week high against the dollar, as investors became more convinced that the Conservatives would win Thursday\u2019s UK election despite their poll lead narrowing. Sterling touched $1.2967 against the dollar, before slipping back to its current level of $1.2936, still up 0.22%. Against the euro, it is up 0.6% at \u20ac1.1513. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said there were also other factors at work in sterling\u2019s favour: The pound found some extra energy this afternoon, though it\u2019s not quite clear whether the currency is being driven higher by home-grown news or events elsewhere. Against both the dollar and the euro sterling jumped half a percent, suggesting that the election-jitters that have bothered the pound for the last fortnight or so have subsided. However, there are potentially other explanations for its growth. The euro has been hit by reports that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts, something that would further kick the rate hike can down the road. In the US, meanwhile, the dollar is gearing up for tomorrow\u2019s testimony from former FBI chief James Comey, an event that could destabilise an already shaky White House. Here\u2019s Reuters on the rise in US crude stocks: Oil prices slid more than 3 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in inventories of crude and gasoline, fanning fears that output cuts by major world oil producers have not drained the global crude glut very much. Crude stocks in the United States grew 3.3 million barrels to 513 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That confounded forecasters who had predicted a drop of 3.5 million barrels, especially a day after preliminary data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated an even bigger drop. Gasoline inventories also unexpectedly rose, imports increased, and exports dropped, the EIA data showed... \u201cFlagging gasoline demand continues to bedevil the market. With gasoline currently the seasonal leader of the complex, its weakness is dragging everything down,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Prices slid even as some in the market remained concerned about the move by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, an OPEC member that had agreed to cut only about 30,000 barrels a day as part of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to reduce output. However, analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some were already concerned about rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement. OPEC has pledged to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to help reduce global inventories. More on the US inventory figures: The drop in the oil price following the unexpected increase in US crude stocks has also had an impact on stock markets. The FTSE 100, which had been just marginally lower, is now down 41 points or 0.56% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped into the red. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually unchanged after its earlier gains, up just 1.2 points. Brent crude is now down more than 3% at $48.46 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 4.6% to $45.95. The surprise rise in US crude stocks contradicts Tuesday\u2019s report from the API showing a decline in inventories. Oil prices were already on the slide after the blockade imposed on Qatar by its neighbours, with analysts concerned the rift could impede Opec\u2019s agreement to curb production. Now they have come under more pressure following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. According to the Energy Information Administration, US crude inventories rose by 3.3m barrels last week to 513.21m, compared to forecasts of a 3.46m decline. Gasoline stocks rose 3.32m, well ahead of the expected 0.58m increase. Brent crude has fallen to its lowest level since early May following the EIA report. Meanwhile the pound is now up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2933, while the dip in the euro on reports that the European Central Bank might cut its inflation outlook on Thursday has helped the pound gain 0.59% to \u20ac1.1512 against the single currency. US markets have opened in positive territory, but investors remain cautious ahead of Thursday\u2019s triple whammy of the UK election, the European Central Bank meeting and - of more concern to Wall Street - the testimony of ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.27%. WPP, whose boss Sir Martin Sorrell earlier received a rough ride from shareholders over his pay packet and his own future at the company, is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. That\u2019s less to do with the annual meeting outcome and more to do with the trading statement issued alongside it. This showed a slightly slowdown in like for like sales growth of 0.7% in the first four months of the year (January to April), down from 0.8% in the first quarter (January to March). Analysts at Jefferies said: One month is not a trend, but these numbers are in focus given the concern around FMCG [fast moving consumer group] spending, US growth in light of the account losses (VW and AT&amp;T) and the weaker start to the year that WPP had in Asia. Later come the latest weekly US oil stocks figures from the Energy Information Administration, a day after an industry survey showed a bigger than expected fall. But the worries over the Middle East after the rift between Qatar and other Gulf states has continued to see oil prices slide, and a positive EIA report may have little impact. Craig Erlam, market analyst at Oanda, said: The only notable data to come today is EIA crude oil inventories which follow an API release on Tuesday that reported a drawdown of 4.62 million barrels. With oil already under pressure as traders appear to question the suitability of the output deal and the latest geopolitical issues in the region weigh, it will be interesting to see whether another large drawdown will offer any support. Having broken below $50 though, Brent continues to look vulnerable to further downside. Manuel Lopez, regulation partner at law firm Ashurst in Madrid, has declared that Santander\u2019s rescue of Banco Popular is a \u201clandmark moment\u201d. It shows that the Single Resolution Board is determined to resolve failing banks, without involving state money, he says. This signals that SRB and other EU regulators will take major steps to ensure that taxpayers don\u2019t bear the cost of bank failures \u2013 and that they won\u2019t wait until the situation deteriorates too far before doing so. The shareholders of Popular have seen, overnight, the results of the lessons learned in 2008. This will not be the last such case, and investors will certainly study the result and the financial consequences of this important decision.\u201d Britain\u2019s top advertising magnate, Sir Martin Sorrell, received a rough ride from shareholders today over his pay package, and his own future. One fifth of WPP shareholders refused to back Sorrell\u2019s latest bumper pay deal, worth \u00a348m, even though the company has tightened its remuneration policy after earlier protests. Investors also demanded more action on a succession plan for life after Sorrell, who is 76, especially as either side can end his contract with no notice. Businesses who are fretting about the election could consider protecting themselves against the pound suffering wild swings when the results come in. Roy Williams, managing director at supply chain firm, Vendigital, explains why sterling volatility could be a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late for businesses to hedge against unpleasant currency-related post-Election surprises. \u201cThe currency markets appear to be banking on a Tory win but the polls are more ambivalent. Businesses operating on low margins with significant imports or exports should consider a late hedge to protect their trading position from exchange rate volatility in the immediate aftermath of the General Election. \u201cPrior to deciding what to do, businesses need to understand if they are a net importer or exporter to each of their various markets. For manufacturers that are net exporters for example, it would be worth considering locking in their exchange rate for a fixed period of time as part of a bank agreement. This will at least allow them a period of financial certainty to plan against. Another option is to line up suppliers in different regions, to give flexibility depending how the foreign exchange markets move, Williams adds. UBS Wealth Management have fired over some analysis of how the financial markets will respond to the result of tomorrow\u2019s general election: None of their scenarios sound particularly appealing, frankly, but here goes.... Conservative enhanced majority Back to business as usual for government. Established trends of rising inflation and weak growth in household incomes unlikely to change, weighing on growth in coming quarters. Conservative majority, in the case of less than stellar performance Prime Minister beholden to backbenchers in her party who favour a swift exit and hard Brexit. Less likely to see a transition deal. This results in sharp slowdown in growth as trade falters. Firms shift investment from the UK into the EU. Labour-led minority government Complete change of economic programme for the UK. Domestic policy takes a backseat amid Brexit negotiations, with lack of clarity over which aspects of Labour\u2019s proposals will be implemented. Sharp drop in business and consumer confidence amid prospect of unstable coalition, muddled Brexit stance, and higher corporate and business taxes. Downside risks to already below-consensus estimates of 1.4% GDP growth for this year and 0.7% for next. The pound has done its best impression of a somnolent sloth this morning. Sterling is unchanged on the day, at $1.2907, on the final trading session before Britons trudge to the polls to elect our next government. Traders are eager to find out which (if any) of the rival opinion polls have actually predicted the result correctly. The pound could rally if Theresa May gets an increased majority, but likely slide if the PM manages to actually lose seats. Paresh Davdra of RationalFX says: \u201cThe pound has remained steady on the eve of the general election. As campaigning reaches its climax, the pound has retreated slightly from the two-week highs seen yesterday but remains stable, as analysts await the election results. The markets are positive about the prospects of Prime Minster Theresa May emerging the winner of tomorrow\u2019s vote, as current polls indicate a secure lead for the Conservatives. However, there is still caution over the remote possibility of a hung parliament or a Labour victory, which investors fear would sink the pound in the aftermath of the election. Most European stock markets have crept a little high this morning, as traders enjoy a quiet day ahead of tomorrow\u2019s excitement. Spain\u2019s IBEX is lagging behind, with Banco Santander down 2% following its plan to raise \u20ac7bn in new capital to cover Banco Popular\u2019s non-performing assets. Thursday will include Britain\u2019s general election, a European Central Bank meeting, and ex-FBI chief James Comey testifying to Congress. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says: We\u2019re seeing mild gains in the FTSE in what is otherwise a mixed European session this morning. US futures are pointing a little higher ahead of the open, with little direction coming from across the pond. The UK index has stabilised in the weeks leading up to the election, with the sudden uncertainty around the outcome appearing to be contributing to the moves. There\u2019s suddenly some drama in the markets, as the euro slides to a four-day low. The single currency shed half a cent to $1.122 after Bloomberg reported that the ECB is preparing to cut its inflation forecasts. Government bond prices are also jumping, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on that debt. Lower inflation forecasts means less chance of the ECB tightening monetary policy soon, and unwinding its huge bond purchase scheme. The Financial Times also argue that the Banco Popular bailout has bolstered the credibility of Europe\u2019s banking sector. Their Madrid bureau chief Tobias Buck writes: Analysts said that the ability of eurozone authorities to decisively step in to wind down Popular and safeguard its assets gives the EU regime new credibility after questions were raised during the tortuous struggle to clean up Italy\u2019s troubled banks. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a case of the regulation doing exactly what it was created for,\u201d said Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u201cBut it does show that there is real risk in investing in these second tier names in the banking sector. The rescue of Banco Popular means that attention will now turn to Italy\u2019s financial sector. Some analysts are speculating on whether any Italian banks will fall into Europe\u2019s resolution mechanism, as some regional lenders are struggling to raise fresh capital. Analysts at ABN Amro, though, fear that some Italian banks aren\u2019t as attractive as Popular. The deal is facilitated by the fact that Banco Popular is actually strong enough to have buyers. Especially their loan book, and diversification to Portugal was of interest. Crucially, the deal could be performed without the need for state assistance. However, in Italy, the banks of Veneto and Vicenza are not in the equivalent balance sheet position as the Banco Popular. It would seem that the large institutions in Italy would be unwilling to take over the banks without the interaction of the Italian state, either via the Atlante fund or another mechanism. The question now is, if Banco Popular has now been stated as \u2018failing or likely to fail\u2019 by the SRB, what does this mean for the arguably weaker banks of Veneto and Vicenza banks This chart, from M&amp;S\u2019s Bond Vigilantes team, shows how Banco Popular\u2019s risky bonds have been wiped out by today\u2019s deal (the orange line). But senior debt (which is further down the pecking order when a company fails) is not being \u2018bailed-in\u2019 to today\u2019s rescue, so its value has actually risen. Once upon a time, a failing eurozone bank would have sparked mayhem in the financial markets. Not today, though. The news that Banco Popular has been acquired for one shiny euro by Santander has caused a notable lack of drama. And that\u2019s because Europe\u2019s bank resolution mechanism is acting like it was meant to. Shareholders in a failed bank have been wiped out, and crucially so have the riskier bondholders. Various Banco Popular debt instruments have been written down, or converted into equity which was then handed to Santander, as part of today\u2019s deal. That means that bondholders who took a risk by holding this debt (which offered attractive returns) are suffering losses, rather than the taxpayer. James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal has tweeted the details: The OECD also hiked its growth forecasts for the eurozone and Japan, but didn\u2019t nudge its UK forecasts. Angel Gurria, head of the OECD, says we shouldn\u2019t get too excited that global growth is heading for a six-year high of 3.5%. He told Reuters that: \u201cEverything is relative. What I would not like us to do is celebrate the fact that we\u2019re moving from very bad to mediocre. It doesn\u2019t mean that we have to get used to it or live with it. We have to continue to strive to do better.\u201d Something to ponder.... This shows why global growth still isn\u2019t \u2018good enough\u2019, in the OECD\u2019s view. This chart shows how the OECD expects the global economy to grow faster, but with many of the benefits heading to the richest: The OECD\u2019s latest global economic outlook is just out, and it gives a mixed picture. On the upside, the Paris-based thinktank has hiked its global growth forecast this year to 3.5%, from 3.3% previously. That would be the best performance in six years. The OECD sees growth rising further to 3.6% in 2018. But it is also concerned by persistent inequality in the global economy, lacklustre wage growth, and signs that the public are losing faith in their governments. And it says the outlook is \u201cbetter, but not good enough\u201d. The OECD has cut its US growth forecasts, but it now more optimistic about China\u2019s economic prospects. My colleague Katie Allen has read the report, and explains: The OECD devoted a significant proportion of its latest report to the possible forces behind a backlash against globalisation. That discontent was seen as a key factor behind Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the race for the US presidency, since when he has pledged to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d. Anti-globalisation sentiment also appears to have boosted protectionist politicians in other countries, including France where the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen made it to the final round of the presidential election but lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron. The OECD said international trade had been a \u201cpowerful engine of global economic growth and convergence in living standards between countries\u201d but that despite those gains, the backlash against it had been rising. Readers may remember that Santander has a track record on rescuing ailing and troubled banks, including in the UK. It took over Britain\u2019s Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester before the financial crisis in 2008, and then added Bradford &amp; Bingley savers to its businesses when B&amp;B\u2019s mortgage book was nationalised. Santander\u2019s chairman, Ana Botin, has insisted that she came under \u201cabsolutely no pressure\u201d from regulators to rescue Banco Popular. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she says This is a transaction that is very good for our franchise in Spain and Portugal. It creates the best bank in both markets. Botin says that an opportunity arose yesterday to present an offer to the Single Resolution Board, to take over Popular, and she\u2019s impressed by how quickly the rescue was handled. This is really great news for Europe, for the financial system, for Spain, and for Santander\u2019s shareholders. Botin says that the deal won\u2019t hurt Santander -- it is sticking with all its financial targets for 2017 and 2018, and will be able to improve on its targets from 2019. The \u20ac7bn of fresh capital is coming from a rights issue, she points out, so Santander\u2019s capital reserves won\u2019t be depleted. There\u2019s no word on any potential job cuts or branch closures. Botin says: We are fully committed to supporting both the team and the customers from today. But what about Popular\u2019s non-performing real estate loans - does Santander really know what it\u2019s taking on? Botin says her staff did have time to do due diligence on Popular\u2019s assets, prior to making its offer. And with Spain\u2019s economy growing strongly, she\u2019s confident this deal will be a success. Elke K\u00f6nig, chair of Europe\u2019s Single Resolution Board (which triggered Banco Popular\u2019s rescue), says that the deal will protect the bank\u2019s savers. K\u00f6nig also argues that the deal vindicates Europe\u2019s efforts to avoid another financial crisis. \u201cThe decision taken today safeguards the depositors and critical functions of Banco Popular. This shows that the tools given to resolution authorities after the crisis are effective to protect taxpayers\u2019 money from bailing out banks\u201d. Here\u2019s the official statement: The Single Resolution Board adopts resolution decision for Banco Popular Back in the UK, the Halifax bank building society has reported that house prices rose by 0.4% in May. That ends a run of four monthly falls in a row, and means prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago. But prices were still 0.2% lower in the March-to-May quarter than in the previous three months, highlighting how the UK housing market has cooled. Spain\u2019s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, has welcomed Santander\u2019s rescue of Banco Popular. In a statement, de Guindos says: \u201cIt\u2019s a good outcome for the bank, given the situation it had arrived at in recent weeks, as it implies maximum protection for depositors and continuity of the bank\u2019s operations\u201d He added that taxpayer money is not involved, and there is no danger of \u2018credit risk contagion\u2019 spreading to other banks. Shares in Santander have dropped by 3% at the start of trading in Madrid. That\u2019s because investors are reacting to its plan to raise \u20ac7bn in new capital to fund its rescue of Banco Popular. Popular\u2019s shares have been suspended, following their sale to Sandander If Banco Popular is in such trouble, why did Santander buy it? Popular\u2019s attraction is its retail banking division, and its small business customers. They can bolster Santander\u2019s existing business, and give it a larger share of the Spanish banking market. Bloomberg reporter Rodrigo Orihuela says: On the one hand, Popular has a very strong SME business and a very strong retail business, which is what Santander wants. The real estate business is the big big question....Everyone will have to wonder whether Sandander can solve it. They probably have a plan. Here\u2019s a video clip of Orihuela explaining the situation: Banco Popular\u2019s collapse into the arms of Santander today was primarily due to \u2018toxic\u2019 real estate loans on its books, and its failure to raise fresh capital. The bank made some seriously bad loans before the financial crisis triggered a major Spanish housing crash, and its management have been unable to fix the damage. Back in February, Popular posted a \u20ac3.5bn annual loss due to bad debts, restructuring costs and various writedowns. Then in May it admitted that it was setting aside even more money to cover real estate losses. Its new chairman, Emilio Saracho, has been trying to sell assets and issue more shares to raise capital, but the market has proved unreceptive to his efforts. The crisis escalated in recent days, as a series of potential buyers dropped out of an auction to buy Banco Popular. With capital levels running dangerously low, and its shares in freefall, the ECB was forced to step in and trigger today\u2019s rescue, to Sandander. Karen Tso of CNBC points out that today\u2019s rescue isn\u2019t costing the taxpayer anything, because Santander will raise \u20ac7bn of new capital from the markets. Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who broke Barings Bank in the 1990s, is struck by the symbolic price of today\u2019s deal: Breaking news from Spain: Banco Santander has bought Banco Popular for \u20ac1, rescuing its fellow Spanish lender from from the brink of collapse. Santander said it would raise \u20ac7bn to cover the capital shortfall and strengthen the balance sheet of Popular, after the European Central Bank deemed it to be \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d. The ECB (which supervises the eurozone\u2019s largest banks) triggered the move after concluding yesterday that Banco Popular was running out of cash. It says: \u201cThe significant deterioration of the liquidity situation of the bank in recent days led to a determination that the entity would have, in the near future, been unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fell due. Santander said it was making the purchase after \u201ca competitive sale process\u201d to rescue the ailing bank. Popular lost more than half of its market value in recent days as investors grew increasingly fearful over its ability to deal with its capital shortfall. Moody\u2019s downgraded the lender on Tuesday. Details and reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. You have to take your hat off to Australia. Despite the economic challenges of the last decade, it has just racked up its 103rd successive quarter of growth - dating all the way back to 1991. However, these latest growth figures aren\u2019t too impressive. Australia\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% in the first three months of this year, a little faster than Britain but slower than France or Germany. That means annual growth is now just 1.7%; the weakest since 2009. Bad weather is partly to blame, with some economists pointing to the disruption caused by Cyclone Debbie in Match. But others are concerned. Michael Workman, a Commonwealth Bank senior economist, says: \u201cThe Australian economy began 2017 with a whimper following a decent pace of expansion in the final quarter of 2016.\u201d \u201cThe weakness in today\u2019s data extends beyond the weather, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has occurred at a time when the global economic backdrop has improved. Here\u2019s more details: That sets the scene for this morning\u2019s main economic event, the OECD\u2019s latest assessment of the global economy. The Paris-based thinktank will update its growth forecasts, and highlight the key threats it sees ahead. We\u2019re not expecting much drama in the London markets today. The pound is hovering around the $1.29 mark, and the FTSE 100 is forecast to open unchanged. Oil remains volatile, though, as the diplomatic crisis in the region rumbles on.

      "bodyText": "There was a time, for many British teenagers, when no Saturday was complete without a trip to Topshop. It was a name that had cache \u2013 and fashion editors didn\u2019t think twice about dressing in Topshop threads. But now young consumers are more likely to pick their party outfits and festival fashion on their phones than traipse to bricks and mortar stores. And Topshop, once a stalwart of the British high street, is falling behind the rash of other UK retailers offering up fast(er) fashion, on the cheap, online. While Manchester-based Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided, as well as Asos, have adventurous online offerings, Topshop is beginning to feel staid. Styling seems to be second nature to these younger brands \u2013 shoots of models wearing metallic bralets and sequinned miniskirts mirror what young consumers see on the Instagrams of influencers and reality TV stars. Next to this, Topshop\u2019s online presence falls flat \u2013 clunky and unglamorous. Fashions rise and fall on Instagram feeds. To keep them interested, retailers need to match that pace. Online retailers don\u2019t have physical stores holding them back, and are better able to better match the dynamism of social media trends. While Topshop\u2019s Oxford Circus flagship store is still a \u201cdestination\u201d shop, branches outside the capital can feel like relics of an age before digital shopping carts, without the pull of a brow, nail or blowdry bar. Young, often cash-strapped shoppers also want cheap clothes. Topshop\u2019s current festival fashion includes an \u00a385 maxi sequin cape, a \u00a390 cropped feather gilet and a \u00a350 limited edition feather collar . And these are not clothes to be worn again and again. Compare that to Boohoo, whose Festival Shop has very few items over \u00a330, and most under \u00a320. For those seeking something a bit more high-end, but still high street \u2013 the people who grew up buying Topshop as teens, but have since become buyers of office wear and maternity wear \u2013 other brands have stepped up. There\u2019s Zara for the more fashion-forward crowd, Cos and newcomers such as Finery. Topshop\u2019s top-end offerings \u2013 such as its Unique line that is sold on Net-a-Porter \u2013 are less enticing than the cheaper offshoots of luxury brands for those with \u00a3200 to spend on a single item. Topshop \u2013 once shorthand for teenage style and its ability to capture the zeitgeist with festival-friendly florals \u2013 is not catering to Generation Z, and it\u2019s not winning over the Generation Y pound either.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire suffered a worse than expected 79% fall in profits last year as it reeled from the closure of BHS and a tough fashion market, during which Topshop\u2019s UK sales fell for the first time in more than a decade. The company said it faced competition from new fashion retailers at a time when clothing had become a less important part of the household budget. Accounts filed at Companies House for Taveta Investments, the Green family company, showed pre-tax profits slumped to \u00a336.8m in the year to 27 August 2016, compared with \u00a3172.2m the year before. Total turnover dived 17% to \u00a32.02bn. Taveta owns the Arcadia Group, which comprises Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis as well as Topshop and Topman. The slump is dramatically worse than the 16% fall in operating profits at Taveta\u2019s continuing operation leaked at the weekend. Sales at Topshop and Topman\u2019s UK stores, by far the biggest brand in Green\u2019s empire, slid 1.3% to \u00a3896m according to separate accounts filed at Companies House. However, a spokesman said Topshop/Topman Limited, the main holding company for the Topshop chain, which owns its businesses in the US and Ireland, was continuing to grow strongly outside the UK. UK sales for Taveta slid 22% to \u00a31.7bn, with a big hit coming from the loss of nearly \u00a3370m in income from BHS stores after it was sold. The problems at Taveta cap a difficult year for Green, who was hauled before MPs and faced calls for him to be stripped of his knighthood after the collapse of BHS. Arcadia has lost several of its top bosses recently, including Topshop\u2019s managing director, Mary Homer, who left last week to run The White Company. Evans\u2019 boss, Fiona Ross, Burton\u2019s managing director, Wesley Taylor, and Miss Selfridge\u2019s creative director, Yasmin Yusuf, have also left in recent months. Taveta\u2019s pre-tax profits were hit by \u00a3129m in one-off charges including \u00a326m in legal fees, redundancies and other costs linked to BHS, which collapsed last April, about a year after Green sold it for \u00a31 to investors led by former bankrupt and racing driver Dominic Chappell. Profits were also affected by a one-off \u00a381m write-down on the value of the group\u2019s stores and a \u00a322m provision for loss-making stores and onerous leases. Green is said to have called in McKinsey management consultants to help him turn around Arcadia\u2019s fortunes and allow the company catch up with rivals in online shopping. In the accounts Taveta\u2019s directors said shoppers were becoming \u201cever more selective and value conscious\u201d and that sales channels were becoming \u201cmore diverse, fast-changing and complex\u201d. They added: \u201cClothing has become a less important part of the household budget.\u201d The directors also pointed to other challenges, including the declining value of the pound, new competition, particularly online, and a squeeze on the spending power from slow growth in average earnings.\u201d Nevertheless, the accounts show Taveta paid \u00a326.6m to Green\u2019s wife, Tina, the ultimate owner of Arcadia, as part of the deals agreed when Taveta bought BHS from the Green family in 2009. Taveta still owes the Green family nearly \u00a387m for the failed department store. The accounts also show Arcadia\u2019s pension deficit, the difference between its assets and liabilities, more than doubled to \u00a3426.8m in 2016 from \u00a3189.6m a year before. Total liabilities are more than \u00a31bn. Taveta has agreed to pay \u00a350m a year over the next three years into Arcadia\u2019s two pension funds for executives and regular staff. In February, the Green family agreed to hand over \u00a3363m in cash to rescue the BHS pension scheme, and settle one of the biggest City rows of recent decades. That came after months of pressure after the collapse of BHS, which led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit assessed at \u00a3571m.",

    "webTitle": "More than a fifth of WPP investors reject Sorrell\u2019s \u00a348m pay package", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than a fifth of WPP investors have voted against Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a348m pay package, as the chief executive and his board faced a barrage of questions at the annual meeting over who will take over as head of the world\u2019s largest advertising group. A total of 21.3% of shareholders either voted against his pay or abstained, the lowest level of unrest over Sorrell\u2019s pay since 2010; 20.79% voted against and about 0.5% abstained. The vote against Sorrell\u2019s pay \u2013 which was down 32% on the \u00a370.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history \u2013 was smaller than last year\u2019s 34%. WPP has moved to significantly tighten Sorrell\u2019s pay, which has seen him receive more than \u00a3210m in the past five years. In 2012, nearly 60% of investors rejected his pay packet, one of the biggest shareholder revolts. \u201cWe are highly uncomfortable with the 2016 quantum, not least in light of our historic concerns about board composition and the remuneration committee\u2019s apparent lack of vigour and stress-testing when the legacy plan was devised,\u201d said Hans Christoph-Hirt of Hermes, which represents investors holding just over 1% of voting rights in WPP. WPP has scrapped the controversial Leap scheme behind the huge payouts and implemented a more stringent policy, which it tightened further last month. Just under 10% of investors voted against or failed to approve the new policy. The revised policy is expected to pay out about \u00a319m a year, and a late revision will see it drop to potentially as low as \u00a313m from 2021. \u201cWe feel able to give qualified support to the proposed new remuneration policy,\u201d said Christoph-Hirt. \u201cAlthough we do remain uncomfortable with the plan\u2019s leverage and therefore the opportunity for high pay.\u201d Sorrell pointed out that WPP\u2019s top staff are on the same incentive pay scheme he is and that tightening the reward policy could impact the company\u2019s performance. \u201cWhat happens to me personally cascades down inside the organisation,\u201d he said, speaking after the annual meeting. \u201cThese were incentive plans that focussed people on performance. The more relevant question is whether the new plans achieve the same result for shareholders. Whether this is the best way. We will see, time will tell whether this is the best way to ensure we get the best results.\u201d He said the overwhelming approval of the new tighter remuneration policy \u201creflects a view that these are better plans from a governance point of view\u201d. In 2021, Sorrell, who has recently become a father again, will be 76. With the question of pay mostly dealt with, investors focused on the long-running issue of succession at WPP. WPP shareholders and funds including Standard Life Investments, Royal London Asset Management, Hermes and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum questioned the chairman, Roberto Quarta, about the plans for life after Sorrell. Quarta, who is a year into his job at the helm of WPP, said succession planning had become even more focused and detailed over the past year. He said the board had meetings with key talent across the WPP group, as well as maintaining a \u201cconstantly refined list\u201d of external candidates. Christoph-Hirt said: \u201cWhile we appreciate the steps that the company has taken so far, we urge the chair to continue to focus on the management of succession risks. Our engagement with WPP does not question whether Sir Martin is the right person to lead WPP but is about ensuring that the company\u2019s success is appropriately safeguarded with an eventual succession proceeding smoothly.\u201d Deborah Gilshan, stewardship and governance director at Standard Life Investments, said: \u201c[Succession] remains the key governance risk to our long term investment in WPP. As another annual meeting passes, the time to address succession for the chief executive shortens and the necessity to do so becomes more pressing.\u201d One quirk of Sorrell\u2019s relationship with WPP is that his contract states that he or the company can terminate his service \u201cat will\u201d, rather than the more usual notice period of 12 months. Standard Life Investments, which holds a 1.5% stake in WPP, challenged the board to force Sorrell to extend his notice period. \u201cUnusually, the CEO\u2019s service contract may be terminated by either the company or Sir Martin without any notice,\u201d said Gilshan. \u201cGiven this, we suggest the board consider what lead time would be required to ensure an orderly succession and discuss this with Sir Martin. \u201cWe would like the board to come to an agreement with him that, other things being equal, he will provide sufficient warning to meet this timeframe. In our opinion, this increases the likelihood of a seamless succession as it would allow the board to execute their succession plans effectively and would reduce further the risk profile of the company.\u201d",

In 2012, nearly 60% of investors rejected his pay packet, one of the biggest shareholder revolts. </p> <p>\u201cWe are highly uncomfortable with the 2016 quantum, not least in light of our historic concerns about board composition and the remuneration committee\u2019s apparent lack of vigour and stress-testing when the legacy plan was devised,\u201d said Hans Christoph-Hirt of Hermes, which represents investors holding just over 1% of voting rights in WPP.</p> <p>WPP has scrapped the controversial Leap scheme behind the huge payouts and implemented a more stringent policy, which it tightened further last month.</p> <p>Just under 10% of investors voted against or failed to approve the new policy. The revised policy is expected to pay out about \u00a319m a year, and a late revision will see it drop to potentially as low as \u00a313m from 2021.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel able to give qualified support to the proposed new remuneration policy,\u201d said Christoph-Hirt. \u201cAlthough we do remain uncomfortable with the plan\u2019s leverage and therefore the opportunity for high pay.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrell pointed out that WPP\u2019s top staff are on the same incentive pay scheme he is and that tightening the reward policy could impact the company\u2019s performance.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens to me personally cascades down inside the organisation,\u201d he said, speaking after the annual meeting. \u201cThese were incentive plans that focussed people on performance. The more relevant question is whether the new plans achieve the same result for shareholders. Whether this is the best way. We will see, time will tell whether this is the best way to ensure we get the best results.\u201d </p> <p>He said the overwhelming approval of the new tighter remuneration policy \u201creflects a view that these are better plans from a governance point of view\u201d.<em> <br></em></p> <p>In 2021, Sorrell, who has recently become a father again, will be 76. With the question of pay mostly dealt with, investors focused on the long-running issue of succession at WPP.</p> <p>WPP shareholders and funds including Standard Life Investments, Royal London Asset Management, Hermes and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum questioned the chairman, Roberto Quarta, about the plans for life after Sorrell.</p> <p>Quarta, who is a year into his job at the helm of WPP, said succession planning had become even more focused and detailed over the past year. He said the board had meetings with key talent across the WPP group, as well as maintaining a \u201cconstantly refined list\u201d of external candidates.</p> <p>Christoph-Hirt said: \u201cWhile we appreciate the steps that the company has taken so far, we urge the chair to continue to focus on the management of succession risks. Our engagement with WPP does not question whether Sir Martin is the right person to lead WPP but is about ensuring that the company\u2019s success is appropriately safeguarded with an eventual succession proceeding smoothly.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Gilshan, stewardship and governance director at Standard Life Investments, said: \u201c[Succession] remains the key governance risk to our long term investment in WPP. As another annual meeting passes, the time to address succession for the chief executive shortens and the necessity to do so becomes more pressing.\u201d</p> <p>One quirk of Sorrell\u2019s relationship with WPP is that his contract states that he or the company can terminate his service \u201cat will\u201d, rather than the more usual notice period of 12 months.</p> <p>Standard Life Investments, which holds a 1.5% stake in WPP, challenged the board to force Sorrell to extend his notice period.</p> <p>\u201cUnusually, the CEO\u2019s service contract may be terminated by either the company or Sir Martin without any notice,\u201d said Gilshan. \u201cGiven this, we suggest the board consider what lead time would be required to ensure an orderly succession and discuss this with Sir Martin. </p> <p>\u201cWe would like the board to come to an agreement with him that, other things being equal, he will provide sufficient warning to meet this timeframe. In our opinion, this increases the likelihood of a seamless succession as it would allow the board to execute their succession plans effectively and would reduce further the risk profile of the company.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of electric cars in the world accelerated past the 2m barrier last year, as prices fell and manufacturers launched new models. The number of battery-powered vehicles numbered just hundreds globally in 2005 and passed the 1m milestone in 2015, but sales jumped 60% in 2016. China, the US and Europe accounted for more than 90% of electric vehicle sales last year, with China the single biggest market, according to research by the International Energy Agency. In some European countries, growth has been so fast that electric cars are taking significant market share from petrol and diesel cars. Nearly a third of new cars sold in Norway are electric, the highest proportion worldwide, followed by 6.4% in the Netherlands and 3.4% in Sweden. While the UK lags behind on annual registrations, industry figures this week showed that a record 4.4% of new cars sold in May were hybrid or pure electric models. More than 100,000 electric cars have been sold in the UK under a grant scheme launched in 2011. The growth globally indicated a \u201crapid market evolution\u201d in electric cars, the IEA said, but it cautioned that they made up only 0.2% of all passenger cars. Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at the Brussels-based Transport and Environment group, said: \u201cThe rapid rise in electric vehicle sales is a consumer-driven phenomenon rather than being down to the efforts of suppliers.\u201d Decreasing costs, longer battery ranges and an increasing number of charging points were driving demand, he said. Worldwide, the IEA found there were 2.3m charging points, although public ones were outnumbered more than six to one, suggesting most drivers were recharging at home. The agency estimates that there will be 140m electric cars by 2030 globally if countries meet the Paris climate deal\u2019s goal of avoiding dangerous temperature rises. Previous forecasts for the growth of the cleaner vehicles has been overly optimistic. Barack Obama hoped US drivers would have bought 1m by 2015, but the actual number was 280,000. In May, Angela Merkel admitted that her goal of 1m electric cars on Germany\u2019s roads by 2020 would also be missed. However, the IEA said government policies to tackle air pollution and global warming would buoy electric cars. The vehicles also got a boost this week from 10 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany and Japan, which have committed to an aspirational but non-binding target of 30% of market share for electric vehicles by 2030. Oil companies have been sceptical about the impact electric cars will have on oil demand. BP projected this year that even with a hundred-fold growth in electric cars by 2035, oil demand will still be growing. However, the company\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, said recently that in the 20 years \u201cobviously sales of electric vehicles will accelerate\u201d. Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP\u2019s chairman, told shareholders at the group\u2019s AGM in May that the company would benefit from producing the gas to generate electricity for the increasing number of battery-powered cars.",

    "webTitle": "RBS court case called off but some investors still refuse settlement", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A high court judge has agreed to call off a landmark case that would have forced the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin to give evidence, but has left the door open for diehard investors to revive proceedings against the bank next month. The case \u2013 in which investors claimed they were misled by the former RBS boss, three former directors and the bank itself during a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008 \u2013 had been due to start on 22 May but a last-minute settlement offer from RBS saw a series of adjournments. During a complex hearing on Wednesday, a high court judge, Mr Justice Hildyard, called for a review of the way such complex lawsuits are brought in the future. He had been told by Jonathan Nash, the QC for 9,000 private investors and a handful of major institutions bringing the legal action, that the case should not proceed after 87% of the shareholder group settled with the bailed-out bank or said they intended to. The judge has called for the remaining 13% of investors to agree to sign up by 20 June and sign up formally by 4 July, or to tell the court by the end of July if they want to resume the trial. To do so, they would need to prove they have the funding to go ahead. \u201cThis solution is, perhaps, I hesitate to use the word \u2018impure\u2019, but nevertheless an unusual one,\u201d said Hildyard, who referred to the fact that the case had been going on for four years. \u201cIn a difficult and novel situation, the process of bringing an end is not as easy as might be thought,\u201d he added. The court was told the RBS Action Group, representing thousands of retail investors, had agreed to the settlement. Nash said he expected a significant number of the 13% yet to sign up would do so. The bailed-out bank offered to double the amount of compensation agreed with shareholders who lost out when they backed the rights issue, which took place six months before the bank teetered on the brink of collapse and required a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. Outside the court RBS, which has spent \u00a31bn keeping the case out of court, said: \u201c87% of the remaining claimants by value have accepted the settlement offer and the trial has now been vacated. This includes the action group, which represents the individual retail claimants. \u201cThe offer remains open for acceptance for a short period to the further 13%. It was made clear today in court that this delay is the result of procedural issues. None of the outstanding claimants have indicated any intention to continue the claim.\u201d While Goodwin now looks likely to escape a court hearing, Rachel Reeves, who was a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee before the election was called, raised the prospect of the former RBS chief executive being called to parliament again. \u201cA lot of questions remain that he should be held accountable for. When parliament returns, this might be something for the Treasury select committee to look into,\u201d she told City AM. The last time Goodwin was called on to account for his action at RBS in public was when he gave evidence to MPs in February 2009 and offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. The settlement of the long-running legal battle has cost RBS about \u00a3900m, with another \u00a3100m in legal fees. Before these legal proceedings, RBS had reached settlements with 87% of investors who had originally brought claims totalling \u00a34bn. The RBS Shareholder Action Group said its refusal to settle earlier had been vindicated by the higher compensation it had received. \u201cThis settlement with RBS comes after many years of campaigning for compensation on behalf of those who lost out in 2008. In that time we have been forced to endure many struggles, including having to fund and run an entire case when the other claimants settled early. Our decision and resolve to press on has been vindicated by this settlement, which is twice that accepted by others who had much greater resources than us,\u201d the group said. The earlier settlement was about 42p a share. Nash told the judge that only one investor, with 2,000 shares, had said they were \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the settlement.",

When parliament returns, this might be something for the Treasury select committee to look into,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/266060/royal-bank-scotland-trial-looks-off-shareholder-group\"> she told City AM</a>.</p> <p>The last time Goodwin was called on to account for his action at RBS in public was when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/10/bankers-apologise-to-mps\">he gave evidence to MPs in February 2009</a> and offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d.</p> <p>The settlement of the long-running legal battle has cost RBS about \u00a3900m, with another \u00a3100m in legal fees.</p> <p>Before these legal proceedings, RBS had reached settlements with 87% of investors who had originally brought claims totalling \u00a34bn. The RBS Shareholder Action Group said its refusal to settle earlier had been vindicated by the higher compensation it had received. </p> <p><em>\u201c</em>This settlement with RBS comes after many years of campaigning for compensation on behalf of those who lost out in 2008. In that time we have been forced to endure many struggles, including having to fund and run an entire case when the other claimants settled early. Our decision and resolve to press on has been vindicated by this settlement, which is twice that accepted by others who had much greater resources than us,\u201d the group said. The earlier settlement was about 42p a share.</p> <p>Nash told the judge that only one investor, with 2,000 shares, had said they were \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the settlement.</p>",

Vodafone will no longer rely on website \u201cblacklists\u201d drawn up by the social media titans and its own advertising agency. Instead, to prevent its ads appearing next to hate speech or fake news, Vodafone will issue a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which it is happy for its commercial messages to appear. The new approach is sensible. Indeed, it\u2019s a wonder that major advertisers have been so slow to protect themselves from Facebook and Google\u2019s failures. Vodafone spends \u00a3400m a year on online advertising. Even if 99% of that money ends up being directed to reputable sites, the other 1% can do serious damage to a brand while also generating revenue for some hideous websites. Advertisers\u2019 reluctance to take the initiative may stem from two factors. First, the worry that drawing up \u201cwhitelists\u201d and employing human judgment is a more expensive way to advertise. Second, a sense that Google and Facebook\u2019s machines are too big and powerful to challenge. Vodafone, let\u2019s hope, has shattered both ideas. Yes, it\u2019s a big advertiser that can afford to carry a few extra costs but it is surely right when it says algorithms, designed to carve up demographic categories, are simply not up to the job of making editorial judgments. It also seems to have little difficulty in laying down the new terms of trade to Google and Facebook. Other advertisers should follow Vodafone\u2019s lead \u2013 and, if not, explain why they\u2019re happy to turn a blind eye when even small portions of their advertising budgets end up funding some of the internet\u2019s most gruesome offerings. Shawbrook would be better going private Shawbrook is the challenger bank that has been a challenging investment at times for its shareholders. Floated at 290p in 2015, the shares fell as low at 130p a year ago after the referendum result \u2013 Brexit was deemed by the market to be unhelpful for UK buy-to-let lenders. Then came Shawbrook\u2019s confidence-rattling revelation of lending \u201cirregularities\u201d in one division. In the circumstances, you might have expected the board to embrace the takeover approach from Pollen Street, already a 38% owner, plus fellow private equity house BC Partners. That was the way the plot seemed to be heading when Shawbrook agreed to open its books. But the board has now rejected four offers, deeming the bidders\u2019 final pitch at 340p a share, or \u00a3868m, to be an undervaluation. One admires the independent directors\u2019 determination to squeeze Pollen Street for every last drop of value. In the end, however, resistance is likely to be futile since acceptances are already 45% and many of the other shares are already in the hands of arbitrage funds who are only there for the final bump in the bid. The real question is whether the bidders manage to pass 75%, at which point Shawbrook would be delisted. It would be a shame to see the ranks of quoted challenger banks depleted. But, actually, Pollen Street and BC make a fair point. The strength of the Brexit storms are unknowable for specialist lenders and may be better combated away from a public market that tends to demand lending growth in all circumstances. It\u2019s possible that Shawbrook, whose returns on equity have been strong when it has avoided cock-ups, will sail through happily. But the bidders aren\u2019t making a risk-free bet. It\u2019s probably best to let Shawbrook go private. Bailey stays on trend at Burberry The annual report would have been a good place for Burberry to explain what on earth the job of \u201cpresident\u201d involves. Christopher Bailey, the outgoing chief executive but continuing chief creative officer, will have presidential status from next month but the demands of the role remain obscure. The \u201cevolved structure\u201d, which will see Marco Gobbetti become chief executive, \u201cwill allow me to redouble my focus on design for this next phase, and on making products and telling stories that inspire our customers\u201d, Bailey tells shareholders in the report. But isn\u2019t all that designing stuff covered by the creative gig? Maybe the un-corporate title is just there to remind everyone who is really boss. The remuneration arrangements suggest the same. Bailey, who has just picked up \u00a310.5m as a delayed retention bonus, will be able to earn an indicative maximum of \u00a37.6m in the coming year. Gobbetti will be chasing a whisker less at \u00a37.3m. A difference of \u00a3300,000 is a rounding error at those levels, of course \u2013 but maybe it simply wouldn\u2019t do for the president to be denied bragging rights.",

    "webTitle": "Australia records 103rd successive quarter of recession-free economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy grew at 0.3% in the first three months of the year, confirming that the country will enjoy 26 years without a recession. Strong growth was recorded in service industries such as finance and insurance, wholesale trade and healthcare, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, but the manufacturing sector slipped backwards for the 10th time in 11 quarters. It means Australia\u2019s economy has grown by just 1.7% over the 12 months to the end of March. It marks the slowest pace of annual growth since late 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The Australian dollar spiked 0.4% on the news, sending the unit to US75.4c. It puts Australia\u2019s annual growth rate below the Reserve Bank\u2019s forecast of 2% to 3% for this year, prompting some economists to say the RBA will now not want to raise rates until 2019. The RBA left rates at an historic low of 1.5% this week, where it has sat since August last year. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, welcomed the 0.3% growth figure, saying it demonstrated Australia\u2019s resilience, but he acknowledged there were \u201cchallenges\u201d in the data, particularly with dwelling investment and net exports. \u201cWeather conditions during the March quarter did affect exports,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI\u2019m advised particularly on other exports in the west. Exports declined by 0.6% in the quarter, detracting from growth \u2026 particularly in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie.\u201d Michael Workman, a Commonwealth Bank senior economist, said the growth figure was disappointing, particularly since global conditions had been improving lately. \u201cThe Australian economy began 2017 with a whimper following a decent pace of expansion in the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weakness in today\u2019s data extends beyond the weather, and the slowdown in the domestic economy has occurred at a time when the global economic backdrop has improved. \u201cThis suggests that policymakers have their work cut out for them if Australia is to post the kind of growth outcomes they have forecast over 2017.\u201d Australia has now recorded 103 successive quarters without a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d (two successive quarters of negative growth), meaning the economy will enjoy 26 years of continuous growth even if the June quarter GDP figure is negative.
