      "bodyText": "Fiat Chrysler announced the recall of 1.9m vehicles worldwide on Thursday related to an airbag controller defect that has been linked to three deaths and five injuries. The recall includes models sold between 2010 and 2014, including the Chrysler Sebring and 200, Dodge Caliber and Avenger, Jeep Patriot and Compass SUVs and aims to resolve a defect in a device called an occupational restraint controller \u2013 a computer that controls the deployment of airbags and automatic seat-belt tighteners in crashes. In the recalled models, the computer may trigger airbags and tighteners unexpectedly, or it might not deploy them at all in the event of a crash. \u201cFCA US no longer uses the occupant restraint controllers or wire routing design found in the affected vehicles,\u201d the company said in a statement. A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler said the company would not disclose who had made the defective part. It\u2019s the second recall this year for this specific type of device at Fiat Chrysler. In February the company recalled airbag controllers in 112,001 cars due to a problem with a desiccant \u2013 a substance added to keep its workings safe from moisture. That recall was related to an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) into airbag controllers manufactured by Continental Automotive Systems. But the problem with desiccants in airbag systems is wider spread than a single supplier or even a single automaker: Takata, the Japanese manufacturer of airbag inflators that supplies Toyota, Nissan and Honda, used ammonium nitrate to expand airbags. When that company did not include desiccants in some inflators, the moisture sometimes caused the inflator to explode into shrapnel. The resulting recall of cars containing Takata inflators affected one in every four cars in the US. In a May press conference, NHTSA administrator Mark Rosekind asked reporters to urge their readers to act rapidly if they discovered they had a vehicle affected by the Takata recall: \u201cPlease, as you report your stories, include this: Vehicle owners who have received notice that there are parts available for their repair should take action immediately.\u201d The cars affected in the current Chrysler recall include the 2010 Chrysler Sebring, the 2011-2014 Chrysler 200s, the 2010-2012 Dodge Calibers, the 2010-2014 Dodge Avengers and the 2010-2014 Jeep Patriots and Compasses. In Canada, an additional 142,959 vehicles are recalled; in Mexico 81,901 will be recalled, including the 2010 Chrysler Cirrus compact car. Models sold outside North America include the 2012-2013 Lancia Flavias in addition to the models listed, totaling 284,051 additional cars. Customers can contact Dodge for information on how to schedule service at (800) 853-1403. This article was amended on 16 September 2016 to clarify the use of dessicants in Takata airbag inflators, and what went wrong in those inflators that triggered the company\u2019s recall.",

      "bodyText": "Glenn Stevens is leaving his post as governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and is passing the torch of monetary leadership to Philip Lowe. When it comes to leadership transitions at central banks, there is a track record of incumbents spruiking the property market before retiring just at the right time to leave things for the new guy who \u201ccouldn\u2019t see it coming\u201d. For instance, after 19 years heading the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan retired from his post in 2006 and was replaced by Ben Bernanke. Like Lowe, in the months prior to his appointment as head of a central bank, Bernanke was denying the existence of a debt-financed housing bubble. Bernanke\u2019s brash denial about any problem with subprime lending cost the US dearly. The same could happen in Australia. As with Bernanke and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Lowe holds a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Likewise, Lowe may eventually engage in extraordinary intervention to bail out a banking system that is dangerously overleveraged and exposed to an inflated housing market. But the RBA must think that\u2019s a good thing \u2013 because it let it happen in the first place. Relative to scale, Australia\u2019s level of household debt dwarfs that of the US at the peak of its housing bubble. Today, the Australian household sector is the most leveraged in the world, with debts equal to 125% of GDP as of the first three months of 2016. In contrast, US household debt peaked at 98% in the first quarter of 2008. The US government was obliged to bail out its overleveraged banking system and mortgage lenders that were too heavily geared towards profiting from mortgage debt. Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the four largest banks in America \u2013 JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo \u2013 had a combined loan book equivalent to 21% of American GDP. In Australia, the mortgage book of the Commonwealth Bank alone is equal to 23% of Australian GDP. We are essentially talking about a housing bubble and leverage profile that has reached a completely different realm of \u201cprime\u201d banking and lending. So what will a future Australian economy look like now under Lowe\u2019s tenure? Though nobody has a crystal ball, RBA policy has been structured in a way to promote inefficient financialisation of the economy and debt-financed speculation to specifically inflate land prices. Unfortunately, it is as simple as that. Stevens\u2019 legacy (whether he likes it or not) clearly sucked diversity out of the Australian economy by allowing our banking system to engage in a scheme to funnel a disproportionate sum of new debt specifically towards the housing market so many more people can suddenly afford to pay more for a home (which raises house prices). Though this strategy is already failing in parts of the country, Lowe\u2019s Australia will not, and cannot, afford to care about reforming the economy to be more efficient or innovative. As under the leadership of Stevens, all that matters now is whether house prices rise or fall and household debt continues to expand faster than GDP and household income. If prices rise, already leveraged households feel comfortable spending more. If house prices fall, homeowners who are stuck with a mortgage five to 10 times their annual income place pressure on economic growth and the overleveraged banking system. If there is a house price correction on the scale some of us fear, expect Lowe to introduce more monetary easing followed possibly by a bailout of Australia\u2019s overleveraged banks with the $300bn bailout facility \u2013 called the committed liquidity facility. A bailout of this size for our \u201ctoo big to save\u201d banks may not be enough to cover all shortfalls without possible nationalisation of some of our financial institutions. Our major banks are simply too big, too leveraged and too undercapitalised to survive a crash in house prices without driving the hard-working middle class a little closer to the poverty line. If inequality in Australia is wide and rising today, programs such as quantitative easing and bailouts, i.e. the RBA purchasing junk mortgages from banks at a premium, will further boost inequality. It will be an attempt to re-inflate house prices whilst rewarding the same bank executives who messed up in the first place and leaving everyone else to fend for themselves. This will be the RBA policy response under a Lowe leadership. Quantitative easing can theoretically go on indefinitely. Globally we are in uncharted waters and do not yet know the true limits of QE. However, there are limits to the specific problems QE can solve, particularly structural problems. If it did solve structural problems, Japan\u2019s central bank would have stopped printing money more than a decade ago. Japan\u2019s unemployment rate today is just 3%. Yet its declining population continues to flank economic expansion. Hence in this instance, a wiser approach for Japan would be to reform its immigration policy or restructure the economy to combat a falling population rather than just printing money and hoping it spurs real growth. Back in Australia, the economy is not looking healthy or progressive amid 17 consecutive quarters (a national record) of falling real net national disposable income per capita, plunging capital expenditure, record low wage growth, immense household debt, negative nominal rental price growth, a trade-exposed sector gutted by the high dollar and a lacklustre innovation scene starved of capital. Unfortunately for Lowe, printing money will not solve these structural issues. RBA policy has helped to generate the largest debt-financed asset bubble in Australian history. This is defended by the RBA, including government and industry, as a natural result of deregulation and \u201cinnovation\u201d by the banking and financial sector. This (Wonder Bra) paper wealth creation model has already been tried and tested on numerous occasions globally. Without exception, all have failed.

    "webTitle": "Hinkley Point C: now for a deep rethink on the nuclear adventure?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s astonishing. British governments have fiddled for a decade with the terms and structure of the Hinkley Point deal. The proposed agreement runs to thousands of pages, as you would expect with an \u00a318bn contract to build the first new nuclear power station in the UK for a generation. Yet nobody seems to have considered what would happen if EDF, an over-indebted outfit over-reliant on the goodwill of current and future French politicians, ever wanted to sell Hinkley. Theresa May\u2019s review is a let-down on the central question of whether the Hinkley Point C project should proceed; she should have binned the project because the technology was unproven and the financial terms a rip-off. But she has addressed the question of future ownership. The UK government will be able to block EDF from selling its stake before and after construction. Similar powers will be secured in future by the UK government taking a special share in infrastructure projects deemed critical to the nation\u2019s security. This is welcome and overdue. Before the clause was inserted, it would have been possible, in theory, for EDF to sell its majority stake in Hinkley to its Chinese co-financiers, the state-backed CGN firm. Overnight, 7% of the UK\u2019s energy supply could have been in the hands of a country with a long and dishonourable history of cyber espionage. David Cameron and George Osborne, as they conducted their love-in with Beijing in recent years, ignored the worry in their desperation to find a new partner for EDF after Centrica, the owner of British Gas, dropped out of the Hinkley consortium in 2013. The energy select committee, shamefully, also danced around the subject of national security. May deserves some credit for addressing it. The Brexit vote, incidentally, may have strengthened her hand. The EU tends to hate golden shares. Outside the club, it should be easier for the UK to adopt stronger protection over ownership of critical infrastructure. But the government is overstating matters when it says the UK\u2019s policy will now fall into line with other big economies. The US imposes far stricter restrictions on foreign ownership of nuclear plants on its soil. That is why, one assumes, the Chinese appear happy to accept May\u2019s \u201csignificant new safeguards\u201d. For Beijing, the big prize has always been the chance to gain international recognition for Chinese technology by building a nuclear power station in Bradwell, Essex, to its own design. That prospect is still alive. But let\u2019s hope May\u2019s brief probe of Hinkley heralds a deeper rethink on the UK\u2019s entire nuclear programme. On cost and design, the adventure has lost touch with common sense. First, cost. Hinkley, as everybody knows by now, is hideously expensive. If it were up and running today, EDF and CGN would be receiving annual revenues of \u00a32.8bn, calculates Peter Atherton, of Cornwall Energy. But only \u00a31.2bn would represent the market price of the electricity produced. The rest, \u00a31.6bn, would be a top-up payment ultimately paid by the public. The figure is large but, if it were a one-off, perhaps tolerable. The UK\u2019s 27m households use about 40% of the country\u2019s energy. Crunch the numbers and a theoretical \u201cHinkley subsidy\u201d works out to about \u00a324 per household a year at current prices. The problem, of course, is that Hinkley in north Somerset is not a one-off. It will provide about 3,200MW of capacity. The government\u2019s decarbonisation programme envisages up to 18,000MW of nuclear capacity by 2035. If Hinkley-style handouts are repeated, you\u2019re talking serious money for consumers and a big hit to the competitiveness of UK industry. That risk is real because of the second issue: the madness of a nuclear new-build programme in which all are invited to pitch. It\u2019s not just China that wants to bring its kit \u2013 Japanese, South Korean and US firms are also on the ticket for new plants. The UK could end up building four different reactor designs from five different manufacturers. That is inherently more expensive than picking the best design, replicating it and harvesting economies of scale. The UK\u2019s approach, argues Atherton, is \u201cthe equivalent of having the four new Trident nuclear subs built in different shipyards to different designs\u201d. It\u2019s too late, it seems, to stop Hinkley. But May should order a rethink of the rest of the UK\u2019s nuclear plan. It\u2019s a badly designed mess that no other country would copy.",

The UK government will be able to block EDF from selling its stake before and after construction.

      "bodyText": "Eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a global financial crisis, the spread of Britain\u2019s bonus culture from the bankers of the City to the hi-tech startups of London\u2019s Shoreditch has seen pay top-ups leap to a new record level. While regular pay growth has remained modest for most UK workers, generous bonuses at firms outside the financial sector have pushed bonuses above their previous pre-financial crisis peak. Total bonus payouts in the year to the end of March rose 4.4% to \u00a344.3bn, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures \u2013 with the biggest cash payments still going to the financial services sector. The total in cash terms beat the record of \u00a342.5bn that had stood for the past eight years \u2013 and threatens to reignite controversy about how key staff are remunerated. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cUK workers have suffered the biggest fall in wages of any developed country apart from Greece. They are still paying the price for the financial crash. For millions of hard-pressed families, these figures will just add fresh salt to the wounds. \u201cTheresa May says she wants a Britain that works for the many, not just the privileged few. What better way to show she means business than by clamping down on mega bonuses and excessive pay at the top.\u201d The new prime minister has made tackling inequality a key pledge after the Brexit vote highlighted the scale of public anger at the growing gap between rich and poor. May has promised to \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d and also criticised fat cat pay. The new prime minister wants companies to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and the average company worker\u2019s pay, and it has emerged that the powerful Commons business committee will on Friday launch a wide-ranging inquiry into the make-up of company boards and executive pay. Latest official figures show that regular earnings growth has slowed since the EU referendum and in a sign of continued insecurity in the workplace. Earlier this month new data also showed there has been a 20% rise in the number of people employed on zero-hour contracts, to 900,000, over the last year. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre said bonuses had their uses but must be handled with care and he highlighted the return to levels last seen when the financial crisis struck in 2008. \u201cOn the one hand, you could see why some employers would want to recognise people and reward them and say \u2018We are through the worst of it\u2019. But on the other hand, there\u2019s a worry that bad habits could return \u2026 I think small bonuses are perhaps a good idea but big bonuses are potentially very dangerous if they encourage people to take excessive risks.\u201d David Hillman, with the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u201cOnce again these figures show that financial sector bonuses are way out of kilter with the rest of the economy. There is a long way to go before the excess of the City is curbed and this huge gulf in rewards between bankers and the public sector is addressed.\u201d The City\u2019s annual bonus round was a feature of the boom years in the early part of the 2000s, but the credit crunch, job losses and a clampdown on some of the riskier activities produced a sharp reduction in the payouts made by banks and other financial companies. The EU also introduced rules designed to limit City bonuses, although the rules actually resulted in many workers demanding higher basic pay. But bonus payments have gradually picked up again. The ONS data shows that finance and insurance remained the biggest contributor to the total. Employers in the sector handed out bonuses of \u00a313.9bn to their staff last year \u2013 an increase of 2.2% from a year earlier. But other sectors, such as IT and communication services \u2013 including marketing, advertising and PR \u2013 contributed more to growth as bonuses at non-financial companies rose 5.4% to \u00a330.4bn. The rewards on offer in the communications business were highlighted when WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, paid its founder and boss Sir Martin Sorrell almost \u00a367m in bonuses for last year. WPP suffered a shareholder rebellion, but approved the payout. At BP, a majority of shareholders opposed chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s bonus-fuelled \u00a314m pay deal. But the vote is only advisory and the rewards were still handed over. Nick Palmer, a statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cAlthough the finance and insurance industry retains the largest share of the total, other industries, particularly among professional and hi-tech business services, have been the biggest drivers of growth since 2008.\u201d Bonuses are spreading beyond the City, even as evidence mounts that the payouts are not good for companies in the long run. A Cornell Law School study found in 2014 that a company performs worse the more it pays its chief executive and that bonuses promote selfishness and opportunism. Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s top fund managers, has recently scrapped bonuses for his employees, arguing they are ineffective and can encourage bad behaviour. Finance and insurance workers received the highest average bonus at \u00a313,400 per employee. Health and social workers got virtually nothing. Almost all the total for last year \u2013 \u00a343.7bn \u2013 was in the private sector with few bonuses in the public sector. Civil servants, teachers and hospitality workers were also near the bottom of the rankings. Though the cash value of bonuses was a record last year, the peak year for bonuses as a proportion of total pay was in 2008, when they accounted for 7.1% compared with 6% last year. The City\u2019s bonus culture was widely blamed for fuelling the credit boom and financial crisis by rewarding bosses and traders with cash for short-term results. In some cases, such as Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, chief executives became multimillionaires while leading their companies to the edge of collapse. In the finance industry, bonuses peaked as a share of total pay in 2008 at 34%. The equivalent figure was 22.7% last year, down from 23.1% the year before. In other sectors, bonuses were 4.5% of total pay last year \u2013 the highest level since the ONS started its calculations in 2000. Oliver Parry, Head of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said bonuses could be a useful incentive for staff, but warned caution was necessary with financial sector bonuses and that the scale of payouts should be linked closely to performance: \u201cFirms have to be very careful in areas like financial products that they don\u2019t create a culture which encourages staff to behave unethically, as we saw with PPI mis-selling. \u201cA separate question is the use of performance-related pay for senior executives, where there have been problems. A few thousand pounds for an employee who hits their targets is one thing, but multi-million bonuses and share awards for CEOs where company performance has not been outstanding, such as we saw at BP, anger shareholders and employees alike.\u201d The ONS said bonuses as a percentage of total pay were 6% for the whole economy, a small increase on the previous financial year.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis and Next, two of the country\u2019s biggest retailers, have reported falling profits as Britons slash spending on clothing and the internet sucks sales out of high street stores. Next chief executive, Simon Wolfson, batted away talk of a July retail sales bounce after it was forced to discount heavily in the wake of poor summer sales in its stores. The retailer revealed 30% more clothing went into its end-of-season sale which contributed to a near-17% fall in first-half profits at its high street store division. He said trading remained \u201cchallenging and volatile\u201d as Britons opted to spend spare cash on eating out and other leisure pursuits. The weak performance worried investors, making Next the second biggest faller in the FTSE 100 with its shares losing almost 5%. The grim picture it painted of high street trading conditions also weighed on the fortunes of rival Marks &amp; Spencer, whose shares were pulled down 2.6%. The gloom was compounded by the John Lewis Partnership, which said it was scaling back the expansion of its Waitrose supermarket chain and warned of further job losses. Pre-tax profits for the group fell 14.7% to \u00a381.9m, excluding exceptional property items, for the six months to the end of July. Operating profits slumped 31.2% at John Lewis, as its Never Knowingly Undersold promise forced it to match rivals promotions, while Waitrose saw a 10.5% fall. John Lewis Partnership chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said the performance reflected the decision to invest in its infrastructure as well as to improve staff pay levels. \u201cWe have grown gross sales and market share across both Waitrose and John Lewis, but our profits are down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reflects market conditions and steps we are taking to adapt the partnership for the future.\u201d The company, which is owned by its employees\u2013 known as partners, said it was taking a \u00a325m writedown relating to sites it had acquired to build seven Waitrose supermarkets that it no longer plans to open. It will instead invest money in sprucing up existing branches, adding new attractions such as wine and sushi bars, which appeal to its upmarket shoppers. The divergence between the performance of each chain\u2019s physical and internet presence showed the challenge bricks and mortar retailers face in a digital age. While sales at established Waitrose stores fell 1%, in line with a fall in its food prices, they were up 4.3% online. At John Lewis department store sales fell 1%, while its website recorded a 18.4% sales surge. Next\u2019s first half performance was shored up by a recovery at its internet arm Directory, where profits rose 10.9% to \u00a3204.2m. As a result, Next\u2019s pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of July was down just 1.5% at \u00a3342.1m. To adapt to this sea change in shopping habits, John Lewis has been investing heavily and last week unveiled the \u00a3150m extension to its Milton Keynes depot that will boost efficiency at its home shopping business before the key Christmas period. The retailer banks at least two-thirds of its annual profits in the second half. Mayfield said it had also increased pay for its lowest-paid partners by \u00a333m \u2013 \u00a330m more than was required by the introduction of the national living wage \u2013 but warned there would be a steady reduction in staff numbers from now on after cutting about 1,500 jobs last year. \u201cWe anticipate that this will mean we will have fewer partners over time compared with today,\u201d he said. Mayfield said John Lewis had felt little effect from the vote to leave the EU, but that uncertainty created by the referendum result would linger. One immediate impact of the Brexit vote was that the group\u2019s pension deficit soared by \u00a3512m to \u00a31.44bn in the first half, because of falling yields on bonds used to fund the scheme. Wolfson warned in March that the high street would suffer the most difficult trading conditions this year since the financial crisis. At the time he likened conditions to \u201cwalking up the down escalator\u201d. The retailer expects its full-price sales to either grow or contract by 2.5% this year, and Wolfson said he hoped to present a clearer picture of trading in November when it reports its third-quarter sales. \u201cWe will hopefully have a bit of cold weather then and be able to see the reaction to our winter ranges, because at the moment it\u2019s impossible to read because no one is buying winter ranges,\u201d Wolfson said.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Sports Direct have fallen by more than 5% after its joint house broker cut full-year profit expectations for the beleaguered retailer by a fifth. Goldman Sachs, which in May recommended investors sell Sports Direct\u2019s stock for the first time in four years, said it had now cut its profit forecast after the company\u2019s warning this month about higher operating costs. Goldman Sachs also said it now believed the group\u2019s profits would be lower after Sports Direct said it would be marking down the value of its property and other assets this year by \u00a3120m, compared with the \u00a395m the broker had expected. Shares in Sports Direct have fallen by about 17% since 6 September when the company released a critical report by its own lawyers in which it identified \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d in working practices at the group\u2019s main warehouse. That was followed by a bad-tempered annual general meeting where Sports Direct\u2019s board was criticised for holding on to chairman Keith Hellawell despite the majority of independent shareholders voting to boot him out. The company is preparing to hold a new vote where Ashley will use his 55% stake to override other investors\u2019 concerns. The company also warned at the AGM that it now expected that profits would be just \u00a3300m in the year to April 2017, \u00a320m less than City analysts were predicting, and well below the \u00a3380m profits earned this year. The company said profits margins would shrink, costs would rise and it would spend more on buying property. Sports Direct has said it expects to increase sales by 9% in the year to April 2017 as it invests more in new stores and improving the look of existing outlets to boost relations with major brands such as Nike and Adidas, whom Ashley said were tired of seeing their product displayed in a \u201cpile-it-high sell-it-cheap\u201d style. At its annual shareholder meeting Sports Direct said it expected to spend more than \u00a3300m a year on property acquisitions \u2013 controversially led by Michael Murray, the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s daughter and head of Sports Direct\u2019s property team. In a statement to the stock exchange in January, the company said Murray was paid no salary and was not a director of any Sports Direct company. It said he would be paid based on \u201ccreating value\u201d, although it did not explain how the added value was calculated. This week the head of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, Iain Wright MP, urged Ashley to stop using the Transline employment agency at the Shirebrook depot. In a letter to Ashley, Wright said: \u201cWe ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with the likes of Selfridges and John Lewis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The World Bank and the United Nations have highlighted the impact of conflicts on civilians in a report showing that the number of displaced people around the globe is equivalent to the UK\u2019s population of 65 million. A study launched jointly by the Bank and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) shows that the root of the problem are 10 conflicts responsible for the majority of forced displacement every year for the past quarter of a century. The report said the issue was emerging as an important development challenge that threatened a backlash against refugees. \u201cExtreme poverty is now increasingly concentrated among vulnerable groups, including people who had to flee in the face of conflict and violence, and their presence affects development prospects in the communities that are hosting them,\u201d the report said. \u201cLarge movements of people are also fuelling xenophobic reactions, even in high-income countries, and this could threaten the consensus that is underpinning global economic growth.\u201d The study singled out Afghanistan, Burundi, the Caucasus, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and the former Yugoslavia as responsible for a crisis that affects 1% of the world\u2019s population. Despite the controversy over refugees and often strong opposition to them in developed countries, the Bank and the UN said that neighbouring developing countries shouldered almost all of the responsibility for coping with the impact of the violent struggles. The report said that 89% of refugees and 99% of internally displaced people were hosted by around 15 developing countries, a pattern unchanged since 1991. At the end of 2015, Syria\u2019s neighbours \u2013 Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey \u2013 hosted 27% of all refugees worldwide; Iran and Pakistan, Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours, hosted 16%; and Ethiopia and Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan\u2019s neighbours, hosted 7%. \u201cForced displacement denies development opportunities to millions, creating a major obstacle to our efforts to end extreme poverty by 2030,\u201d said the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with our partners to help the displaced overcome their ordeal and seize economic opportunities, while ensuring that host communities can also benefit and continue to pursue their own development.\u201d The report also highlighted that refugees account for less than 1% of the population in most host countries. In Turkey, Chad, Djibouti and South Sudan, they account for between 2% and 3.5%. Only in Lebanon and Jordan does the proportion exceed 4%, and by a large margin \u2013 18% in Lebanon and 9% in Jordan. The new report said it was important that development organisations intervene to help countries affected by displacement. It identified three phases of support: helping host nations prepare before large numbers of people arrived; providing support to tackle long-standing issues such as health and education; and helping to create jobs. It added that unlike economic migrants moving to places where there were jobs, the forcibly displaced were fleeing conflict and violence, often suffering from a loss of assets, lack of legal rights and a lack of opportunity. \u201cThey need dedicated support to overcome these vulnerabilities and regain confidence in their future \u2026 so they can work, send their children to school and have access to services,\u201d the report said. Kim has made tackling the causes of the refugee crisis a key priority for his tenure at the World Bank, and is expected to build on this report with initiatives to boost the economic prospects of displaced people.",

On that day, official borrowing costs in the UK stood at 5%. In the months that followed the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee cut them aggressively until in early 2009 they hit 0.5%. Nobody \u2013 not even the ultra-pessimists \u2013 imagined back then that in September 2016 the Bank would be considering cutting interest rates, from 0.25% to 0.1%. But the assumption that ultra-low interest rates were a passing phase proved to be entirely false. The world economy has never truly recovered from the shock administered by the near-death of the banking system in late 2008, symbolised by the Lehman Brother\u2019s bankruptcy. Growth has remained weak, real incomes have been squeezed, popular anger at ruling elites has grown. Donald Trump\u2019s run at the US presidency and the Brexit vote can both be traced back to those tumultuous days eight years ago. The possible implications of a British exit from the European Union explain why the Bank could well cut interest rates again before Christmas. As expected, the MPC kept rates unchanged at 0.25% at its latest meeting but sent out a strong signal to the markets that it was in the mood for further easing. That\u2019s despite the fact that the economy has performed rather better since the referendum than the Bank envisaged when it announced its big package of stimulus measures in early August. Back then, the MPC envisaged that the economy would grind to a virtual standstill in the third quarter. Now Threadneedle Street\u2019s in-house economists think the initial stab at estimating activity from the Office for National Statistics will show growth of 0.2%, rising to 0.3% when more data comes in. So why is another rate cut in the offing? Firstly, the Bank thinks some of the deleterious effects of Brexit \u2013 on investment in particular \u2013 will take time to show up. Secondly, it wants to keep downward pressure on the pound to boost exports. And finally, the prospect of still cheaper money has boosted financial markets and it fears a backlash if it fails to deliver. That doesn\u2019t mean rates at 0.1% are a dead cert. But it will take even better economic news over the coming weeks to prevent them from happening.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons was the FTSE 100\u2019s highest climber after the supermarket chain reported its third consecutive quarter of sales growth. Sales, excluding fuel, at stores open for more than a year rose 2% in the three months to the end of July, more than double the rate analysts had predicted. This helped lift underlying half-year profits at Britain\u2019s fourth largest grocer by a better-than-expected 11% to \u00a3157m. Total sales slid 0.4% to just over \u00a38bn, with Morrisons saying it had shut down stores equivalent to nearly 5% of its total space. The closure of loss-making stores helped boost profits and led to Morrison\u2019s first rise in sales at its physical outlets since 2012. Morrisons finished the day as the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Thursday morning as investors reacted positively to its first-half results, with shares up 7.5% to 208p. The retailer said it also expected cost savings to exceed its \u00a31bn target by the end of 2016-17 after it cut head office jobs, rejigged its pensions scheme and made lots of small efficiency savings. David Potts, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe are still in the foothills of our recovery programme. We\u2019ve returned the business to core customers and sped the business up. We\u2019re pleased with progress so far and there\u2019s a lot more we can do and will do for customers and colleagues but so far so good.\u201d The Bradford-based business said it was too early to know how the EU referendum result would affect the British economy, but \u201ccustomers tell us their food shopping has not changed. We have seen no negative impact on customer sentiment or customer behaviour.\u201d However, it warned of some uncertainties, especially on the price of imported food, if sterling remained at its current lower level against the euro and the dollar. Potts said that whatever the rise in costs and economic impact of the Brexit vote, it fell to Morrisons to \u201cbecome increasingly competitive in the sector regardless of the prevailing circumstances\u201d. Morrisons\u2019 strong sales performance comes after two rounds of price cuts in recent months. Earlier this month it trimmed prices on nearly 160 products by an average 12%, just a month after cutting the price of more than 1,000 products, including toiletries and seasonal fruit and vegetables, by an average of 18%. Potts added that introducing more takeaway foods and placing them in handier positions near its supermarket entrances. Potts said sandwiches had probably been the group\u2019s top performing area, with sales of ready meals up 9% after it improved quality and reduced prices. Before Christmas, the chain will double the range of its premium The Best range and also attempt to reduce costs with new initiatives including the installation of rapid self-scan tills that handle a trolley of shopping via a conveyor belt, without the need for a staff member. Morrisons has begun selling fresh and frozen food via Amazon as well as through its own website. During the six-month period, Morrisons said it had made \u00a35m of additional profit from wholesaling food to Amazon and its petrol forecourt\u2019s partner Motor Fuel Group as well as new services, interest and online improvements. Potts said there was still room to introduce new services that would help attract people to Morrisons stores. The group recently installed about 100 Amazon collection lockers at it stores and now plans hundreds more. It also wants to bring in other online collection services including Doddle and InPost as it tries to find a way to exploit the rise in online shopping.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England left the door open to another interest rate cut this year but decided that the safest option for now was to wait and see if the economy can continue to weather the initial shock of the Brexit vote. Following signs that businesses and households have largely shrugged off the initial shock of the referendum, all nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted to leave interest rates at a record low of 0.25% and to continue with an electronic money printing programme. That package of measures, which included a reduction in the main borrowing rate from 0.5%, was announced in August in an attempt to shore up the economy after the referendum. Minutes from this month\u2019s meeting showed policymakers thought there would still be a \u201cmaterial slowing\u201d in economic growth in the second half of this year, but to a lesser extent than predicted at the time of August\u2019s rate cut. \u201cA number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cThe committee now expects less of a slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016.\u201d For now, an internal judgment by Bank staff suggests GDP growth will come in at about 0.2-0.3% in the third quarter, the minutes said. That was stronger than their view at the time of the August rate cut, when they forecast growth would be close to zero. The meeting record showed a majority of policymakers were still open to another rate cut, probably to 0.1%, before the end of the year. Much will depend on the Bank\u2019s next inflation report due out on 3 November, when it produces new forecasts for the economy based on the latest indicators. \u201cIf, in light of that full updated assessment, the outlook at that time is judged to be broadly consistent with the August inflation report projections, a majority of members expect to support a further cut in Bank rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC\u2019s forthcoming meetings during the course of the year,\u201d the minutes said. City commentators highlighted that statement, which reiterated the Bank\u2019s guidance in August that another interest rate cut could come this year. Reacting to the minutes, Paul Hollingsworth, at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWe, along with the consensus of economists and the markets, expect another cut in interest rates to 0.10% in November.\u201d But Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, was more cautious about predicting a cut. \u201cOf course, the data may well worsen from here. But as things stand, the conditions laid out for a rate cut this year - for the outlook to remain in line with that published in the August inflation report - are not in place,\u201d she said. Ahead of June\u2019s referendum, Bank governor Mark Carney and other economists drew criticism from Brexit campaigners by warning that a vote to leave the EU could tip the UK into recession. With early indicators since then suggesting the economy has continued to grow, Carney has defended his pre-referendum comments and August\u2019s decision to cut interest rates and pump money into the economy through quantitative easing, where the bank buys bonds off financial institutions. One former member of the monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, said on Thursday that the Bank was right to launch a package of supportive measures in August. \u201cAbsolutely clear MPC was right to act and consumer and business expectations picked up because they did so,\u201d Blanchflower tweeted. The decision to leave policy unchanged at this meeting comes after several economic indicators suggested activity has rebounded from the initial post-EU referendum fall . But economists warn that overall growth will still be sharply lower this quarter and next, compared with the first half of 2016, and that spending by households and firms risks slowing more markedly as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest. Earlier this week, the British Chambers of Commerce slashed its growth outlook on expectations of a slump in investment and slowdown in consumer spending. Echoing that longer-term caution, the Bank\u2019s policymakers said it was difficult to use recent data to gauge the prospects for 2017 and that there had not been any new clues as to the longer-term prospects for the UK economy. Economists had not expected a move at this meeting but said the Bank would be closely watching how the referendum outcome affected sentiment and activity in the months ahead. James Knightly, economist at ING bank, said: \u201cFor now, there isn\u2019t a strong case for additional stimulus, but we are a little concerned that activity could weaken now that Brexit is much more in the news after a summer lull. Arguments and animosity about the situation along with the uncertainty that Brexit creates are likely to weigh on sentiment as the positive effects of the Olympics and a warm end to the summer start to fade.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China is set for a central role in Britain\u2019s nuclear industry after the government gave the go-ahead for a new power station at Hinkley Point. The Chinese company involved in the \u00a318bn project plans to submit a design for a nuclear power station in Essex within weeks. China General Nuclear agreed to take a 33% stake in Hinkley Point C in Somerset, alongside the French energy group EDF, in return for leading the project at Bradwell, Essex. CGN said it was \u201cdelighted\u201d that Theresa May\u2019s government had approved the power station at Hinkley Point. Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power plant in Britain since 1995 and eventually provide 7% of the country\u2019s electricity. However, it has been dogged by concerns about its cost and safety. The plant could eventually cost British taxpayers almost \u00a330bn in subsidies to EDF and its Chinese backer. The government provoked uncertainty about the future of the nuclear industry after it delayed giving final approval for Hinkley Point C in July. May was said to have had concerns about Chinese involvement in such a sensitive project. However, it is understood that as part of the government approving Hinkley Point C it has assured CGN that its plans for Bradwell are still welcome. Sources close to the Chinese state-backed company said it intended to formally submit plans to the regulator to build its own nuclear reactor at Bradwell soon, potentially within weeks and almost certainly this autumn. CGN is understood to be confident about winning approval for its plans for Bradwell, although the review process for proposed power stations can take years. It is also ready to press ahead with proposals for another power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. If approved, the plants would give CGN a pivotal role in providing Britain with energy for the next generation. This is despite May insisting on a \u201crevised agreement\u201d for Hinkley Point C and the government pledging to take a special share in future nuclear projects to protect national security. CGN said: \u201cWe are delighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy. \u201cCGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years\u2019 experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK\u2019s future energy needs.\u201d Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, chief executive of EDF, said the government\u2019s decision \u201cmarks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe\u201d. CGN\u2019s role in Bradwell B and Sizewell C were agreed with EDF in return for investing in Hinkley Point C. While EDF owns two-thirds of Hinkley Point C and CGN owns a third, this is likely to be reversed for Bradwell. It is intended that EDF will have an 80% share in Sizewell, with CGN holding the rest. China\u2019s investment in nuclear power stations has attracted a mixed response. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said the funding of new power stations should be separated from the design. He said: \u201cWith Hinkley now confirmed, attention must rightly shift to the other new nuclear power stations \u2013 including Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk \u2013 which we badly need across the country. The solution, however, is not to hand over the replacement of vital UK infrastructure lock, stock and barrel to China. \u201cGMB strongly cautions that the funding of nuclear developments should always be kept totally separate from the regulation of the design and construction of new nuclear facilities and the transport and safeguarding of nuclear and radioactive materials. Chinese pop-up power stations are not a solution on their own.\u201d However, business leaders welcomed the investment in Britain\u2019s infrastructure and the introduction of a special share to protect national security. The changes to the Hinkley Point C deal mean the government will be able to block EDF selling its controlling stake in the project and have more influence over future developments. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe government is right to grasp the nettle to remove the potential for uncertainty surrounding a future sale by seeking a \u2018golden share\u2019 in critical infrastructure projects. \u201cThis is a well-considered approach to balance foreign investment, which the UK needs, against an uncertain future. This is an important dynamic to consider, especially in the context of critical infrastructure projects where decisions on ownership could have direct implications for businesses being able to operate.\u201d A so-called golden share in Hinkley Point C was first muted by the Liberal Democrats when they were in government. However, George Osborne, then the chancellor, is understood to have opposed it. EDF has previously signalled that it could reduce its stake in the project to 50% by bringing in other investors. CGN could also include fellow Chinese-stated backed energy company CNNC. However, Nick Timothy, May\u2019s joint chief of staff, pointed out in an article for ConservativeHome last year that CNNC stated on its website that it was responsible not just for \u201cincreasing the value of state assets and developing the society\u201d but the \u201cbuilding of national defence\u201d. Timothy claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to \u201cshut down Britain\u2019s energy production at will\u201d and argued against giving a \u201chostile state\u201d access to the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, as the dust settles following the Bank of England\u2019s meeting. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s updated news story: Back tomorrow. Cheers! GW In other news....a double-dose of bad economic news from America just hit the wires. Retail sales in the world\u2019s largest economy shrank by 0.4% in August, twice as fast as in the UK during the same month. And US industrial production shrank 0.4 per cent last month \u2013 dashing expectations of a 0.2% rise. That\u2019s the biggest monthly decline since March, and suggests America\u2019s economy isn\u2019t ready for an interest rate rise. Britain\u2019s savers and pension fund holders may be irked by the prospect of another interest rate cut before Christmas. Charles Cowling, director at pensions consultants JLT Employee Benefits, says that ultra-loose monetary policy will have serious implications: \u201cIf markets are to be believed we could see interest rates stay at current record lows for the next 5 years, which is not good news for pension schemes. This means there is no respite in sight from the record pension deficits caused by the Bank\u2019s interest rate policy. As a result, there are going to be inexorable demands on employers for significant increases to cash funding of pension schemes. This will not be good news for share prices or dividends.\u201d Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, believes central banks are playing a dangerous game: \u201cLast month\u2019s monetary stimulus package, however, dragged down bond yields and added to the funding problems of pension funds. These long-term consequences of a prolonged period of low interest rates require more consideration from the Bank of England and other central banks. As we approach the 8th anniversary of the collapse of Lehmans, interest rates around the western world are still stuck close to zero. That is not a healthy situation for the long-term growth of economies - as we have seen in Japan.\u201d Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, shows how stock markets have outperformed bank accounts since 1996: If anyone is unsure about the benefits of investing in the stock market over stashing cash under the mattress, our calculations show if you had invested \u00a315,000 into the FTSE All Share index 20 years ago you would now be left with \u00a355,105. If, however, you had invested \u00a315,000 into the average UK savings account over the same period, you would be left with a paltry \u00a320,100. That\u2019s a difference of \u00a335,005 \u2013 far too big for anyone to ignore. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects another rate cut in November: Here\u2019s his take: \u201cThe Monetary Policy Committee had already cast doubt on the large fall in the July PMIs, so the economy\u2019s bounce back in August should not have come as a surprise to them. There is enough evidence to suggest that while the economy may have slowed in Q3, it did not fall into recession, and the MPC note that data has actually been slightly stronger than they expected. \u201cHowever, the Bank sees these short term concerns as a side issue, noting that there has been no new information since the August Inflation Report relevant for the UK economy\u2019s longer-term prospects. \u201cThe Bank\u2019s view is that the Brexit process will take some time, and will create uncertainties for households and firms. Specifically, they expect business spending to slow more sharply than consumer spending in response to this uncertainty. In my view, the news since the August Inflation Report should not have impacted this medium term assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects, and I expect another rate cut in November.\u201d The minutes of today\u2019s meeting are online here. This was the last monthly meeting held by the MPC, which now moves to a new schedule of just eight meetings a year. The next scheduled announcement on interest rates is 3 November, when the Bank will also publish new forecasts for inflation and growth and Carney will hold a press conference. This is widely seen as the most likely time for another interest rate cut. The last scheduled MPC meeting for 2016 is on 15 December. Another factor that could sway Bank policymakers deciding on whether to cut interest rates even lower is chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement due on 23 November when he will set out the new government\u2019s tax and spending plans. Bank governor Mark Carney has repeatedly urged ministers they need to play a role in helping shore up the economy rather than leaving all the work to interest rate-setters at the Bank. Sterling is gloriously unrattled by the Bank of England\u2019s announcement, and still hovering around the $1.322 mark. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes that the Bank of England could well cut interest rates again before Christmas. But he also believes it won\u2019t do much good; instead, chancellor Phillip Hammond needs to boost government spending in November\u2019s autumn statement. \u201cUK interest rates already close to zero, further cuts will do little to stimulate growth and are likely to exacerbate the cost pressures that both businesses and consumers may face in the coming months from a weakening currency. \u201cWith the monetary policy tools at the MPC\u2019s disposal largely exhausted, it is vital that the government uses the upcoming Autumn Statement to deliver a fiscal environment that supports confidence and incentivises businesses to invest.\u201d Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says government spending, not central bank firepower, is the key to boosting UK growth. \u201cIn a world with zero bound growth, central banks will become increasingly judicious in choosing when, and how to act, and currently there is no pressing need for the MPC to show their hand again. Though trade data following Brexit reflects a positive narrative, there are still long-term considerations. The economy is still imbalanced, and investment has stumbled somewhat in light of uncertainty around the finer details of what a post-Brexit UK will look like. Businesses and investors are likely to exercise caution in the meantime, looking ahead to a potentially changing fiscal agenda, and the timing and nature of the article 50 trigger. A trigger as early as Q1 2017 would ease uncertainty, but any longer will make businesses think twice about commencing long-term capex plans.\u201d Some snap reaction to the Bank\u2019s announcement: The Bank of England also reckons that business spending will suffer a bigger hit from Brexit uncertainty than consumer spending (a theory borne out by this morning\u2019s strong retail sales figures). It says: While most business investment intentions surveys weakened further since the August Inflation Report, the near-term outlook for the housing market is less negative than expected and the indicators of consumption have been a little stronger than expected. The Bank of England has dropped a clear hint that it could cut interest rates soon, perhaps as soon as November, unless the economy picks up. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting say: \u201cThe committee\u2019s view of the contours of the economic outlook following the EU referendum had not changed. News on the near-term momentum of the UK economy had, however, been slightly to the upside relative to the August inflation report projections. The committee will assess that news, along with other forthcoming indicators, during its November forecast round. If, in light of that full updated assessment, the outlook at that time is judged to be broadly consistent with the August inflation report projections, a majority of members expect to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC\u2019s forthcoming meetings during the course of the year. The MPC currently judges this bound to be close to, but a little above, zero.\u201d The Bank minutes noted inflation had come in weaker than anticipated back in August. They also noted that share prices had risen following last month\u2019s interest rate cut and expansion to the electronic money-printing programme known as quantitative easing. \u201cThe package of measures announced by the committee at its August meeting led to a greater than anticipated boost to UK asset prices,\u201d the minutes said. The Bank of England says it is less pessimistic about the UK economy. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting state that \u201ca number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected\u201d since August\u2019s rate cut. \u201cThe committee now expect less of a slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016. But policymakers said it was more difficult to use recent data to gauge the prospects for 2017 and beyond. \u201cMoreover, there had been no new information since the August inflation report for longer-term prospects for the UK economy.\u201d Ooooh, the two Bank of England policymakers who opposed expanding quantitative easing last month still think it was a bad idea. Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty argued that the extra \u00a360bn of bond purchases was \u201cunwarranted\u201d, but reversing the decision would be too costly and disruptive. Here\u2019s the news, hot off the Bank\u2019s twitter feed: Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at 0.25%, an all-time low. It has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3435bn. Both decisions were unanimous, with the MPC voting 9-0. More to follow! City traders are bracing for the Bank of England announcement at noon. Anthony Cheung of Amplify Trading says investors will be scrutinising the minutes of today\u2019s meeting for signs of a split within the Monetary Policy Committee. With 20 minutes until the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates, let\u2019s take a moment to remember that eight years ago all hell was breaking loose in the markets. Just after midnight US time on 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The news rocked Wall Street, triggering panic selling, and forcing policymakers to bail out a string of other financial firms to avoid complete meltdown. It was a genuinely scary time -- financial workers have been reminiscing about how they raced to withdraw cash as they feared the game was up. Eight years later, forecasts of a new great depression or massive market crashes have not come to pass. Instead, central banks have instead driven asset prices up, slashing borrowing costs and sending bond yields to record lows. Have policymakers saved the day, or simply deferred the day of reckoning? Ask us in in another eight years..... Here\u2019s our news story about the UK retail sales figures: The recent run of strong economic data shows that confidence has bounced back after the immediate Brexit vote shock, says Sir John Gieve, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gieve says that the BoE would probably claim some credit, as might Theresa May (for rapidly forming a new government). Both things probably has an impact in stopping things escalating through the summer. But there\u2019s no case for fresh action from the Bank of England today, Gieve adds. Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance is also on the show. He doesn\u2019t believe Mark Carney should take credit for the economy\u2019s resilience. It takes six to nine months for interest rate changes to feed through to the economy.... the Bank of England has moved prematurely [by cutting rates last month]. UK consumers are saying \u201cso much for Brexit, the sun is shining!\u201d, writes Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank. He reckons the UK economy may keep growing in the July-September quarter, despite the Brexit shock. But he also warns that retail sales growth may slow, especially if inflation and unemployment rise... The risk is that there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Good weather has been the main driver of spending growth in the last 2 months. But that might come unstuck in September - seasonal sales of warm clothing may suffer amid spectacular September weather. I\u2019d rather have the warm weather than a warm coat, but I\u2019m trying to sell government bonds, not coats and jumpers. The retail sales figures show that Britain\u2019s economy is defying pessimistic predictions, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: The vote to leave the EU appears to have had little to no effect on consumers\u2019 willingness to spend, and the underlying trend in UK retail sales remains one of robust growth. Surveys in the immediate aftermath of the referendum showed a sharp dip in consumer confidence, leading to predictions of weak sales over the coming months. However, the post-referendum landscape has been characterised by surveys forecasting a sharp weakening of activity, which have thus far failed to appear in the hard data. Today\u2019s figures show that, so far at least, it appears to be business as usual for the UK consumer. Here\u2019s some more detail about the 6.2% year-on-year jump in retail sales in August: all store types except textile, clothing and footwear, and household goods stores showed increases in the quantity bought and amount spent compared with August 2015 the quantity bought in household goods contracted year-on-year for the first time since May 2014 compared with August 2015 there were falls in average store prices across all store types, with the largest fall in petrol stations (2.5%); however, the fall of 1.9% in all retailing is the smallest fall we have seen since November 2014 Those strong August retail sales figures mean there\u2019s even less reason for the Bank of England to slash interest rates again today. Boom! New retail sales figures show that British consumers haven\u2019t been badly upset by the Brexit vote. Retail sales dipped by just 0.2% in August, the Office for National Statistics says, and were 6.2% higher than in August 2015. That beats City forecasts for a 0.4% monthly decline. And July\u2019s already-impressive figures have been revised even higher, from 1.5% to 1.9% during the month. The ONS says: Regarding the EU referendum in late June, our data on retail sales since the vote show little evidence of a departure from recent trends. This chart shows how the City expects the Bank of England to cut interest rates again in the months ahead (but probably not today). John Lewis has reported that the Brexit referendum hasn\u2019t caused it any grief yet. But the bellweather retailer is still finding life tough - profits have dropped by 15% in the last six months. And the company\u2019s pensions deficit has widened alarmingly - up by over \u00a3512m to \u00a31.44bn. John Lewis blames the fall in government bond yields, which has cut the income generated from sovereign debt. The foreign exchange markets are eerily calm this morning, as traders await the Bank of England\u2019s announcement at noon. The pound has dipped by 0.2%, and is bobbing around the $1.32 mark: Newsflash from Zurich: the Swiss central bank has slashed its growth forecasts for the European economy, following the UK\u2019s EU referendum. The Swiss National Bank says: The SNB still expects the moderate growth in the global economy to sustain over the coming quarters. However, the vote for the UK to leave the European Union has caused considerable uncertainty and makes an assessment of the global economic outlook more difficult. The SNB has revised downwards its growth expectations for the UK and the euro area. As regards the global economy, the risks remain to the downside, owing to numerous structural problems. The SNB also cut its inflation forecasts, and left interest rates on hold, at minus 0.75%. Here\u2019s the official tweet confirming that Hinkley is going ahead: And here\u2019s some early reaction: Today\u2019s Bank of England meeting follows a decent set of economic data this week. For example, inflation remained at 0.6% in August, and the jobless rate remained at 4.9% in the May-July quarter. That suggests the economy isn\u2019t being spooked badly by June\u2019s referendum. But there\u2019s still a serious risk of a downturn this autumn; confidence may slide as the process of actually leaving the EU gets underway Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains: As MPC member Kristin Forbes warned in front of the Treasury select committee, the recent run of strong data must be taken cautiously with a potential downturn around the corner as Brexit negotiations begin and the economy processes the consequences. Whilst many believe the bank may have acted too soon, lower rates will facilitate the economy if there is a downturn in data over September and October as we approach the end of the year and near closer to the expected triggering of Article 50. Newsflash: After weeks of indecision, the UK government has decided to press on with the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. The decison was made after striking a new agreement with French energy firm EDF. The government says: The Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. However, ministers will impose a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain\u2019s critical infrastructure, which will include nuclear energy and apply after Hinkley. More here: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that Bank of England policymakers could clash over the impact of the Brexit vote at today\u2019s meeting. He writes: While Bank of England governor Mark Carney has claimed that he is \u201cserene\u201d about the MPC\u2019s \u201csledgehammer\u201d actions last month he has already found himself in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the extent of the Bank\u2019s response. This means that there is virtually no chance of any further policy action on the part of the central bank much before the Autumn Statement in November. If anything the minutes could well show up robust debate particularly amongst those who voted against further QE at the last meeting, and who now have proved to have been correct in their assessment, that it wasn\u2019t necessary, even though one of them Martin Weale has since been replaced by Citibank\u2019s Michael Saunders. Most City economists expect the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold today. But many also expect a fresh rate cut at November\u2019s meeting. A Reuters poll, just released, found that a majority believe borrowing costs will be cut to just 0.1% in two month\u2019s time. They are also less pessimistic about the impact of the Brexit vote on the economy, and now believe there is only a 35% chance of a recession over the next year. That\u2019s down from 60% in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney told MPs last week that he was gloriously \u2018serene\u2019 about the Bank of England\u2019s approach to Britain\u2019s Brexit vote. And today, the governor will be corralled with fellow policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee to discuss the state of the UK economy and decide if more stimulus measures are needed. In truth, the Bank is very unlikely to take any fresh measures today - just a month after slashing interest rates to record lows and extending its quantitative-easing bond-buying programme by \u00a360bn. But the minutes of today\u2019s meeting, which will be released at midday, will show the Bank\u2019s thinking on Brexit -- and whether the MPC are split. Last month, three hawkish members of the committee rebelled against Carney - voting against the \u00a360bn QE boost. Might Ian McCafferty and Kristin Forbes give the governor a hard time today (Martin Weale has now left the MPC). Forbes and McCafferty might point to recent economic data that has showed little immediate damage from the Brexit vote - and no sign of the recession which forecasters had predicted (yet anyway). Analysts at RBC Capital Markets reckon the Bank will sit tight today, as the dust settles following June\u2019s referendum. They say: No change in policy is expected this time and if the recent Treasury Select Committee hearing on the August Inflation Report is anything to go by, there isn\u2019t likely to be much of an elaboration on the Committee\u2019s view about post-referendum economic performance. We know the Committee are cautious about placing too much weight on the survey indicators after the vote so it is clear they are taking a longer-term approach. Also coming up today... Here\u2019s the economic calendar: 9.30am: The latest UK retail sales figures, for August 10am: Eurozone inflation for August 12pm: Bank of England interest rate decision &amp; minutes 1.30pm: US retail sales figures, for August We\u2019ll have an eye on Greece today too, as talks continue with its lenders over its bailout programme (and the slow pace of reforms). It\u2019s also a busy morning in the City, with retail group John Lewis and high street chain Next both reporting a drop in sales. But things may be improving for supermarket group Morrisons. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

There is enough evidence to suggest that while the economy may have slowed in Q3, it did not fall into recession, and the MPC note that data has actually been slightly stronger than they expected. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, the Bank sees these short term concerns as a side issue, noting that there has been no new information since the August Inflation Report relevant for the UK economy\u2019s longer-term prospects. </p> <p>\u201cThe Bank\u2019s view is that the Brexit process will take some time, and will create uncertainties for households and firms. Specifically, they expect business spending to slow more sharply than consumer spending in response to this uncertainty. In my view, the news since the August Inflation Report should not have impacted this medium term assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects, and I expect another rate cut in November.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da8967e4b05caf65ecd76f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T11:43:51.142Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2016/sep.pdf\">The minutes of today\u2019s meeting are online here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da880de4b05caf65ecd766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katieallen\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T11:42:51.389Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This was the last monthly meeting held by the MPC, which now moves to a new schedule of just eight meetings a year.</strong></p> <p>The next scheduled announcement on interest rates is 3 November, when the Bank will also publish new forecasts for inflation and growth and Carney will hold a press conference.

Personally I do not have a problem with him working for a private bank \u2013 but maybe not this bank,\u201d Juncker said in an interview featured on YouTube (at 45 mins). \u201cGoldman Sachs was one of the organisations that knowingly or unknowingly contributed to the enormous financial crisis we had between 2007 and 2009. So one does wonder about the particular bank he has ended up working for.\u201d Barroso led the commission from 2004-14 and has come under intense pressure since his appointment in July as chairman of Goldman Sachs International, the bank\u2019s UK and European operations. Earlier this week, Juncker launched an unprecedented investigation into whether Barroso broke EU rules by taking the job. The former prime minister of Portugal is being asked to clarify his responsibilities at the bank, according to a letter from Juncker to the EU ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly. Some staff from European Union bodies have reacted with fury to the appointment, denouncing their former boss\u2019s behaviour as \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d. An anonymous group of workers launched a petition calling on Barroso to forfeit his pension for bringing the EU into disrepute by joining Goldman Sachs. The petition has been signed by almost 145,000 people. Barroso, however, hit back at the criticism, insisting he would act with integrity and discretion in his role. In a letter to Juncker, Barroso said he was not being employed as a lobbyist nor as a special adviser on Brexit. \u201cI have not been engaged to lobby on behalf of Goldman Sachs and I do not intend to do so.\u201d He accused Juncker of discrimination by warning Barroso he would not be received in EU institutions as a former president, but as an \u201cinterest representative\u201d subject to the same rules as other lobbyists. \u201cI have never sought a privileged position but I would not expect to be discriminated against,\u201d Barroso said. \u201cNot only are these actions discriminatory but they appear inconsistent with decisions taken in respect of other former members of the commission.\u201d",

Whatever it was \u2013 and it was probably a combination of all those factors \u2013 August was a hot month for the retail trade.

The underlying picture, reflected in the 1.6% increase in retail sales volumes over the three months to August, is one of strong consumer confidence. This is perhaps not entirely surprising.

With retail sales growing at an annual rate of more than 6%, the ONS\u2019s comment that there did not appear to have been any major fall in consumer confidence since 23 June is self-evident. Given the strength of spending, critics of the Bank of England will question Threadneedle Street\u2019s decision to cut the cost of borrowing last month. The Bank would argue that its package of measures helped to lift spirits when they were particularly low, although the big jump in retail sales over the summer came in July, before its monetary policy committee intervened.

Pre-tax profit for the partnership for the six months to the end of July fell 14.7% to \u00a381.9m, excluding exceptional property items. Operating profit dropped 58.3% to \u00a3113.7m as the group wrote down \u00a325m relating to the value of property acquired to develop seven Waitrose supermarkets that it no longer plans to open. Profits slid at the group\u2019s department stores and supermarkets as they were forced to adapt to a rapid shift toward online shopping. Sales rose 3.1% but profit was held back by price competition, pay increases, IT costs and a new distribution network that includes a \u00a3150m extension to the group\u2019s Milton Keynes depot. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the employee-owned partnership\u2019s chairman, said John Lewis had felt little effect from the vote to leave the EU, but that uncertainty created by the referendum result would linger. One immediate impact of the Brexit vote was that the group\u2019s pension deficit soared by \u00a3512m to \u00a31.44bn in the first half, because of falling yields on bonds used to fund the scheme. Mayfield said: \u201cOur commitment to competitive pricing, excellent service, increasing pay and investing for the long term have held back profits. We expect the trading pressures to continue through this year and next. \u201cThe EU referendum result \u2026 has had little quantifiable impact on sales so far. Instead there are far-reaching changes taking place in society, in retail and in the workplace that have much greater implications.\u201d He said John Lewis had increased pay for its lowest-paid partners, as its workers are called, by \u00a333m \u2013 \u00a330m more than was required by the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. He said the group wanted to keep average partner earnings well above the new minimum wage for over-25s, but that there would be a steady reduction in staff numbers from now on.. Rob Collins, the managing director of Waitrose who took over from Mark Price this year, plans to open just five Little Waitrose convenience stores over the next six months and two main supermarkets, and plough money into improving existing stores instead. He wants to open more in-store eateries such as bakeries, wine bars and sushi stands to drive up underlying sales at existing stores. Collins expects to add bakeries in at least 200 more large stores over the next three years.",

      "bodyText": "Biffa, the waste management business, has announced plans to raise \u00a3270m in the biggest UK flotation since the vote to leave the EU. The 104-year-old company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) will value it at a reported \u00a31bn or more and will consist of new shares and those held by its owners. Biffa said it would use the money from the flotation, once transaction fees were paid, to reduce debt and pay the government in connection with a dispute over landfill tax. It also signalled plans to buy competitors in a sector with lots of smaller operators. The flotation will mark a return to the stock market after Biffa was bought by a group of private equity firms in 2008 in one of the last big buyouts before the financial crisis peaked. The company, which was part of Severn Trent until 2006, was forced into an emergency restructuring in 2012 and was taken over by its lenders. Biffa, which has an annual turnover of \u00a3927.5m and employs more than 7,000 people, is Britain\u2019s second-biggest waste management company and has contracts with many local councils. It collects, processes and disposes of 6.6m tonnes of waste and recyclables for more than 95% of UK postal codes and 2.4 million households. The once-booming market for flotations froze in the first half of this year as companies waited for the result of the EU referendum held on 23 June. The IPO market has shown recent signs of recovery: Pure Gym, the no-frills fitness chain, announced plans on Wednesday to raise \u00a3190m. Setting out reasons to buy its shares, Biffa said the UK waste market was expected to grow 5% a year until 2020 as the population and number of households increase. Extra rules requiring separate collections and treatment of waste items would lead to more business, it said. Smaller operators would struggle to cope with increasing regulation and complex supply chains, giving Biffa opportunities to buy competitors and cut costs, it added. It has been snapping up competitors and has a list of potential future deals. Ian Wakelin, Biffa\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThere are multiple levers for continued organic growth and margin expansion in a market underpinned by structural growth drivers which favour Biffa\u2019s service-oriented business model. We operate in a fragmented market providing opportunities for further highly synergistic in-fill acquisitions.\u201d Underlying operating profit has increased to \u00a362.5m from \u00a333.6m in the past three years and recent trading has been good, the company said.",

      "bodyText": "UK retail sales dipped only slightly in August following a bumper July in the latest sign that the Brexit vote has done little to dent consumers\u2019 willingness to spend. Sales fell by 0.2% last month, driven by lower sales of clothing, shoes, and household goods according to the Office for National Statistics. But it was a better-than-expected performance, with economists forecasting a 0.4% drop, partly because July was an unexpectedly strong month on the high street. The ONS said July was even better than initially thought, revising up the monthly jump in sales to 1.9% from 1.4%. It was the best July for retail sales in 14 years. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said: \u201cThe takeaway point from this report is UK consumers are saying \u2018so much for Brexit, the sun is shining\u2019.\u201d Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes were 6.2% higher in August than in the same month last year, suggesting any uncertainty caused by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU is having little impact on consumer confidence. Mel Richard, a statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cDespite a small fall after July\u2019s sharp increase, the underlying pattern in the retail sector remains one of solid growth. Overall the figures do not suggest any major fall in post-referendum consumer confidence.\u201d The healthy picture painted by the official retail sales figures of the high street was not reflected by John Lewis and Next, which both reported a fall in profits. John Lewis said price competition and a rising wage bill contributed to a 15% fall in profits in the first half of 2016. Lord Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, said that strong sales at the retailer in July were driven by a bigger end-of-summer sale than the year before, adding that current trading was difficult. Profit fell 1.5% in the first half of the year. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \u201cHopes had been building for something of a summer recovery on the UK high street, but Next\u2019s comments today have tempered that optimism a touch.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Post Office workers across the UK are striking today in protest against branch closures, job cuts and pension changes. About 4,000 members of the Communication Workers Union, which represents postal workers, and about 700 members of Unite, which acts for managers, are to picket around the country throughout the day. We asked staff why they were supporting the action. Many of their responses echo what Dave Ward, general secretary of CWU said in an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday. Their main concerns are pension reforms, a culture of unattainable sales targets and job losses across the business. Below are their stories, which we\u2019ve kept anonymous. \u2018I will be facing a 47% reduction in my pension\u2019\u2013 postal officer, 50 From the Post Office\u2019s own projection as to how their pension changes will affect me personally, I will be facing a 47% reduction. Having worked for the service for 14 years, this is why I will be striking. Who in their right mind would sit idly by and let this happen without fighting for a better deal? As employees we are trying to focus on providing the best service we can despite the changes and disruption being constantly thrown at us. The government and Post Office management should accept that we are a vital service for communities across the length and breadth of the British Isles and properly fund it to maintain this service rather than trying their best to run it into the ground. Their actions are either deliberate or incompetent and I\u2019m not sure which of those scares me the most. \u2018I and many others have had our loyalty thrown back at us\u2019 \u2013 customer advisor, 55 I like many others have been pushed to breaking point. The company I was once proud to work for no longer cares about me or our loyal customers. The once 18-strong workforce in our busy office is reduced to nine. Last week we had to open with just two staff due to holidays, long term sickness and bad management. It is so wrong and a complete breach of our security. My pension is about to be slashed. I and many others have had our loyalty thrown back at us and job security taken from us by a higher management team that want us destroyed. The fact that no one cares and trying to do the job I love with less help than ever before Many of us have worked and dedicated our lives to the Post Office \u2013 I\u2019ve been here 20 years. Losing our branch offices and the knowledge of your dedicated workers is not good customer service at all. The smaller branches will not only have staff that are not trained, but will not be able to provide all the services to the customer or indeed the companies we represent. \u2018We\u2019re a public service, not a supermarket\u2019 \u2013 Post Office manager I\u2019m tired of senior management running this business so badly. All they do is cut. They never look at ways to invest in people and products. They don\u2019t look at ways to increase business with services the public actually want. The general public are tired of being flogged home phones and life insurance. The government needs to step up and take accountability for a public service rather than allowing branches to be closed. It also needs to take accountability for the decision to separate Royal Mail and the Post Office \u2013 huge mistake. Sales targets are the biggest issue for me. We\u2019re a public service, not a supermarket. People want good customer service, not a sales pitch every time they walk into a Post Office. If things keep on going this way the post office will cease to exist within 10 years, and the government will only have themselves to blame. \u2018It\u2019s not a business and never will be\u2019 \u2013 postal officer, 50 After 31 years with the Post Office I\u2019m striking because I\u2019m sick of being continually lied to, because offices are constantly being closed or franchised and because we as employees are continually forced to try to force products on customers who are sick of being targeted week in week out. The business has no plans for growth, just cuts, cuts and more cuts. Frontline staff are bullied to achieve unrealistic sales targets and continually blamed for not getting the sales, and there is no job security at all. Now the Post Office Ltd are planning to close our pension scheme, which is multi-award winning. This will leave thousands of colleagues with around 30% less in retirement. I\u2019d say to them hands off. It\u2019s ours. Many colleagues have given 30-plus years service and have seen countless business reinvention programmes that have all failed miserably. The current board has also failed in its attempt to grow a business that is not a business and never will be. It needs to listen to the customers. \u2018I have been threatened and abused at work on many occasions\u2019 \u2013 former Post Office mortgage specialist, 60 I will be supporting my ex-colleagues on the picket line because what management are doing to the Post Office is appalling. Staff are bullied into selling financial products whether they are suitable for the customer or not. Morale is the lowest it\u2019s ever been \u2013 I used to love my job but in the end it made me ill and I couldn\u2019t continue any longer. Staff have to record in a diary how many \u2018conversations\u2019 they have had and how many leads they have provided to the financial specialist and mortgage specialists \u2013 the customer base in my branch was mainly pensioners and asylum seekers, neither of whom qualify for a mortgage (or most of the other products to be honest) but this wasn\u2019t taken into account. I have been threatened and abused at work on many occasions (If I had a pound for every time a customer said to me \u2018why don\u2019t you get behind the counter instead of trying to sell us life insurance\u2019 I\u2019d be rich ...) I\u2019d say to the government: think about the workers. Come and walk a mile in their shoes and see how you get on. I doubt any one of them would be able to stand the constant pressure of a working week behind the counter, trying to serve customers, putting up with abuse, trying to fit back office duties in while not making mistakes with money. It\u2019s a nightmare. I\u2019m glad to be out of it but I feel for my colleagues who are a wonderful bunch of caring people.",

      "bodyText": "Next said it had seen no post-referendum recovery in sales and that trading remained difficult after profit fell in the first half of the year. The fashion retailer said it had strong sales in July but that this was the result of a bigger end-of-summer sale than the year before. Lord Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, said the pound\u2019s fall could push up inflation and squeeze consumer spending power. Wolfson said the pound\u2019s fall could increase the wholesale cost of buying garments by up to 5%. He said he would sooner lose some sales than take a big hit on profit margins, suggesting prices are likely to rise in stores. The company\u2019s shares were leading the FTSE 100 fallers on Thursday morning, down 5% at \u00a349.52. The Tory peer said consumers had continued to switch spending away from clothing to leisure items such as eating out and holidays. He said the current quarter was likely to be the toughest of the year for Next but that business would pick up if there was a cold winter. He said: \u201cFull price sales in July remained subdued, so we do not believe that July trading represented any change in underlying consumer spending patterns. Trading since July, which to some extent may have been affected by the sale, has remained challenging and volatile.\u201d Next\u2019s pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of July fell 1.5% to \u00a3342.1m as full-price retail sales fell 4%. Retail profits fell 16.8% to \u00a3133.9m but group results were supported by a recovery at the Directory home shopping division where sales rose 10.9% to \u00a3204.2m. Retail sales rose in July after falling in June, according to official figures. The numbers appeared to suggest shoppers had shrugged off the Brexit vote as warmer weather boosted trade though economists warned the snapshot could have little bearing on the longer term health of the high street. Wolfson warned in March that the high street would suffer the most difficult trading conditions this year since the financial crisis. He blamed a general consumer slowdown and a growing trend for people to spend on experiences rather than material goods, as well as unseasonal weather. Wolfson stuck to guidance for annual profit published in August, which said annual profit could fall as much as 5.6% or rise by up to 2.9%. He said the wide range reflected economic uncertainty and volatile consumer demand.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union\u2019s trade negotiators are due to meet their US counterparts on Thursday amid growing speculation that talks over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have ground to a halt. The European commission\u2019s trade chief, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, will meet US trade ambassador Michael Froman in a bid to rescue the TTIP talks at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday described as a \u201cstocktake\u201d of the negotiations so far. The two sides are understood to be preparing to put the talks on the back burner while policymakers consider complaints about a similar and equally controversial EU trade deal with Canada. The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) deal with Canada is due to be ratified by the council of ministers next month prior to being debated by the Strasbourg parliament. But protests in Germany, France and Finland could wreck the agreement and with it the prospects for the TTIP talks. A gathering in Germany of SPD members next week at a special congress could force the left-of-centre party\u2019s leadership to reverse its support for CETA, and trigger widespread revolt across the continent against the deal and its cousin TTIP. Last month Sigmar Gabriel, the SPD leader and economy minister in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said that \u201cin my opinion, the negotiations with the US have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it\u201d, though he remains a supporter of the CETA deal. EU officials believe the ailing European economy can only recover with the help of trade deals that harmonise rules and regulations, making it easier to sell goods and services abroad. A spokesman for the commission said it was aiming to strike a comprehensive deal with the US. He said: \u201cSince the beginning of this year there has been a intensification of contact between negotiators, both at technical and political level.\u201d He denied that negotiators were shedding controversial elements of the talks to secure a deal before the US president, Barack Obama, leaves office at the end of the year. \u201cA quick deal would likely be a scaled down deal that would not include meaningful outcomes for most of the EU\u2019s interests. That would mean far fewer benefits for EU citizens. It is in the EU\u2019s interest that substance prevails over deadlines,\u201d he said. But Jude Kirton-Darling, Labour MEP for north-east England and a member of the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the political arm-twisting needed to secure the CETA deal could spell the end for TTIP. \u201cTTIP has been stalled for months, and [Thursday\u2019s] meeting is merely a face-saving exercise for both the US and the EU. Political attention in Europe is now really focused on the finalised EU-Canada CETA deal, due to be ratified in the coming months, which up to now has been subject to less public scrutiny but raises many of the same concerns around standards, public services and the rule of law,\u201d she said. \u201cLoud public declarations from EU leaders and their opposition to TTIP in recent weeks can only be understood in the context of growing public discontent over the CETA deal. TTIP\u2019s life support machine will be turned off if doing so helps to secure a majority in favour of CETA.\u201d TTIP has become the focus of anti-globalisation protests in the US and Europe with both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, accusing the Obama administration of promoting a trade deal that would cost jobs and drive down wages. The European commission has come under intense pressure to abandon the talks following protests across Europe against provisions that campaigners argue will allow US companies to demand access to public sector contracts. Opponents have also complained that a separate courts system to resolve trade disputes will allow corporations to sue governments when new laws restrict their ability to make profits. Malmstr\u00f6m has overhauled the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system used in most trade deals, which anti-TTIP campaigners have described as a secretive courts process for the sole benefit of multinational corporations. She has proposed a more transparent version, which has retrospectively been inserted into the CETA agreement. The anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now has described TTIP as having \u201clittle to do with selling more products\u201d and being \u201cmore a charter for deregulation, which threatens to change the way we make decisions about laws\u201d. This week Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, called for all future trade agreements to \u201cstipulate the primacy of human rights\u201d in a clear reference to the private courts systems included in TTIP and CETA deals. He said existing treaties should be revised to ensure that they did not conflict with the duty of government to fulfil binding human rights treaties and meet environmental and health goals.",

    "webTitle": "Ford to move all small-car production to Mexico as profits set to fall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ford has warned shareholders that it is pouring cash into \u201cemerging opportunities\u201d and expects a steep decline in its financial performance in 2017. The second-largest US automaker dropped its expected pre-tax profits forecast from $10.8bn to $10.2bn as it announced plans to expand its self-driving and electric lines in the face of intense competition from Silicon Valley as well as traditional car firms. Chief executive Mark Fields also said that the company was moving all of its small-car production to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who called the decision \u201chorrible\u201d. \u201cWe will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States,\u201d over the next two to three years, Fields told Wall Street analysts at annual investor day presentation. Fields reiterated plans to explore ride-sharing options for its automated vehicles, framing the change as an expansion into a new market. \u201cAs we expand to be an auto and a mobility company, we\u2019re not moving from an \u2018old\u2019 business to a \u2018new\u2019 business,\u201d Fields said. \u201cThe world is moving from simply owning vehicles to owning and sharing them. That\u2019s why we are expanding to sell more vehicles and provide transportation services at the same time.\u201d The lowered guidance from Ford was also driven by old school problems as well as future plans. The company lowered its 2016 pre-tax profit forecast to $10.2bn from a minimum of $10.8bn because of an expanded a vehicle recall. Multiple models across multiple years were found to have door latches that could malfunction and cause the doors to fly open while driving, causing a $640m impairment charge. The recall comes at a bad moment as Ford attempts to move forward with the development of nascent technology that will take years to return investment, notably self-driving cars. The company has highly ambitious plans to enter the emerging sector as early as possible with a \u201chigh volume\u201d of cars available. Ford is also pushing an unusually large number of electric vehicles and will invest some $4.5bn in 13 new models that will comprise 40% of its lineup by 2020. Driverless cars are gaining acceptance in parts of the US. Uber began a pilot study for automated cabs in Pittsburgh this week, although they have a human co-pilot for now. And California\u2019s legislators are pushing for a relaxation in the rules governing robot cars on their roads. Ford expects its first fully automated models to be road-ready by 2021, regulators permitting. Though the focus at the moment is on consumer vehicles, the possibility of automated commercial highway travel is also enticing. Rival manufacturers including Daimler and General Motors are also working on plans to build driverless trucks that would allow trucking companies to send shipments across the country. Ford and its peers are also facing a growing challenge from technology companies including Apple and Google which are testing their own models, while high-end electric vehicle maker Tesla already produces vehicles that enable partial automation with its \u201cautopilot\u201d function, which was involved in a fatal accident this summer. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Ford said it \u201cplans to achieve cost efficiencies averaging $3bn annually between 2016 and 2018 and is adding new processes like zero-based budgeting to further its business transformation\u201d. \u201cZero-based budgeting\u201d requires that every single budget item be individually approved, which bodes ill for new staplers at the Ford offices. Beyond the simple cost of the research and development, though, there are serious regulatory hurdles to interstate travel in self-driving vehicles, as the US Congress has pushed back on automakers who believe their own standards are high enough: \u201cIf I asked somebody, \u2018Do you think that that red light means stop?\u2019 and they came back to me and said: \u2018We have great respect for stoplights,\u2019 I would say, \u2018The answer is \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d Senator Michael Blumenthal of Connecticut told General Motors\u2019 Michael Ableson at a hearing in March. \u201cThe credibility of this technology is exceedingly fragile if people can\u2019t trust standards,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cNot necessarily for you, but for all the other actors that may come into this space at this point.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The OECD report, Investing in Youth: Australia released this week argues that the rise of the youth not in employment, education or training (Neets) requires a strong policy response including improving the quality of vocational education and training, better identification of at-risk youth and somewhat controversially, follow up on the recent tightening of eligibility for disability benefits to ensure youth are not on a path out of the labour force. While here in Australia we don\u2019t talk about the \u201cthe Great Recession\u201d, for Australian youth the events of 2008-09 were truly a recession. In March 2008, a record high 65.1% of those aged 15 to 24 were employed. By July 2016, it was just 58.8%. By contrast the fall in the percentage of those employed aged over 25 was just 0.7% points: Not surprisingly, given that 10% drop in the level of youth in employment, the OECD report found that there had been a significant increase in the numbers of youth out of employment, but also out of education and training. This is a crucial point. While there might be economic benefits from these youth working rather than learning, essentially the problem is that they are doing neither. The OECD found that since 2008 there has been a 100,000 increase in the number of 15-29 year old Neets. Now, including people up to 29 years old is a bit of a stretch but even when we use the standard youth employment definition of 15-24 year olds we see a similar increase. In the middle of 2008, 9.9% of youth aged 15-24 were neither working nor in full-time education (the OECD figures include those in any form of education); now it is up to 11%. But it is worth getting some historical context. The current level of 11.0% is actually quite low. Prior to the mining boom years it was never below 12%: It\u2019s why I have in the past been rather quick to counter the narrative pushed by the likes of Joe Hockey that youth need to either be earning or learning. The reality is that youth, almost as much ever in the past, are doing just that. And it is important that the OECD notes the difference between those Neets who are looking for work, and those who are \u201cidle Neets\u201d \u2013 neither working, nor in education, nor even looking for work. But a look at the figures again show that the current level of 6.5% of youth who could be classified as \u201cidle Neets\u201d is among the lowest level in the past 30 years: The big driver of the rise of Neets is the number of youth who are unemployed \u2013 having risen from 3.5% of all youth in 2008 to now 4.4%. A look over the past 30 years shows that the big change has not been an increase in idle youth, but those who once left the education system to work, to those who are working while staying in education. Thirty years ago, 61% of youth were workers who had left the education system; now only 41% are in that category. By contrast, back then only 10% were working and also attending full-time education compared to 26% of youth doing that now: But that things are not too bad historically doesn\u2019t mean we can dust our hands and not worry about the situation. Even among 15-24 year olds, we are still talking about 344,000 people. And as the OECD report notes, there are also big issues when you break down the numbers. The report notes that Indigenous youth are most at risk of falling into the not-employed, not-in education category. It found that while Indigenous youth represent 3% of the youth population they account for 10% of all Neets. Similarly young women are much more likely to be \u201cidle Neets\u201d than are men. While just 5% of male youth are idle Neets, 8% of women aged 15-24 are in that category: The OECD notes that this is driven \u201centirely by women with young children.\u201d So this includes women who are by no means idle at all, but who are prevented from working due to a \u201clack of access to affordable childcare and insufficiently flexible working arrangements\u201d. In response, the OECD argues the government focus on the availability and affordability of childcare, particularly for single parents and that it also \u201ctarget childcare benefits more efficiently towards parents\u201d on lower incomes. It also notes that as those with year 10 or lower education attainment are more likely to become trapped in the Neet category, there should be work done to \u201cimprove the identification of youth at risk of dropping out of school through a timelier and more systematic sharing of school attendance data\u201d. It also argues that \u201chigh-quality vocational education and training is essential in preparing young people for the labour market\u201d and that while Australia does have high numbers of such students, the low level of completion rates suggests a need for \u201cfurther improved guidance for at-risk youth wishing to choose these routes\u201d. The report also noted that Newstart is \u201csignificantly less generous than those in other OECD countries\u201d, and that it was clear that \u201cthe benefit rates on their own are not sufficient to keep a young person above the poverty line\u201d. One consequence of this is the rates of Australians on disability benefits is the sixth highest among the OECD. On this score, the report agreed with the government\u2019s efforts to tighten the ability for people to gain access to the disability support pension because \u201ca person\u2019s chances of returning to employment are very low\u201d once disability benefits have been granted. The report was however quite scathing of the government\u2019s work for the dole scheme. It noted that \u201cthere is little robust evidence\u201d to show that such programs were effective, \u201cin particular when compared to alternative measures such as training programs\u201d. The report also found that work for the dole programs actually reduced youths\u2019 participation in training. Nearly 94% of Australian youth are either working, learning or trying to get work. That level is as high as it has ever been, but it does not mean we should not worry about the remaining 6%, because, above all, the biggest problem is that youth who are out of the work force and not in education are much more likely to end up living a life in poverty.",
