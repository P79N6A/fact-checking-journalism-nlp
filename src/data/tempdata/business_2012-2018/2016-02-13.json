      "bodyText": "Anita Roddick was never an everyday entrepreneur and the Body Shop business, which she founded 40 years ago this year, was never a conventional company. Back in the have-it-all 1980s of Margaret Thatcher and yuppies, Roddick was a hippy chick running a right-on ethical beauty company. She railed against what she saw as the misery created by body and beauty fascism, and campaigned loudly on multiple causes \u2013 from saving whales to freeing Black Panther activists. She trekked to rainforests and Nigerian villages to champion the rights of indigenous people and the environment, and to seek out local beauty secrets. Ten years ago, however, Roddick shocked her fans by selling out to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the world\u2019s biggest cosmetics maker. Body Shop remains a vast international business \u2013 with more than 3,000 stores in 65 countries \u2013 but faces far more competition than when it started out, from more upmarket ethical brands such as Dr Hauschka and Chantecaille, plus British rivals Lush and Neal\u2019s Yard. But now the chain is hoping to revive the spirit of Roddick, who died in 2007, with environmental and community-minded initiatives designed to put it back at the forefront of ethical business. The man with the plan could not be more different to Roddick. Jeremy Schwartz, who took over as chief executive of The Body Shop in 2013, is a corporate man with a CV that stretches from management consulting to marketing roles at L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Coca-Cola, Sainsbury\u2019s, News International and back to L\u2019Or\u00e9al. He intends to mix the latest technology \u2013 such as making packaging from plastic created using excess methane collected from farms and refineries \u2013 with ideas once championed by its founder. Roddick originally encouraged customers to return its trademark plastic bottles for refills, while Schwartz is planning a trial in which shoppers can return used plastic pots and see them turned into pellets for recycling in store. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of Heath Robinson machine. I\u2019m a bit worried about health and safety, but I hope it can work,\u201d he says of the pellet-maker. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al takeover gave Body Shop\u2019s ethical image a knock, as the international cosmetics firm had been criticised for its record on animal testing before the Europe-wide ban came into force in 2009. Roddick ensured that Body Shop\u2019s own principles were protected under the terms of the takeover, and insisted she could be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d who would be able to influence the new parent into adopting some of her ethical ideas. Schwartz, like Roddick, is an adventurous type who has cycled across Tibet and hitch-hiked from Cape Town to Zimbabwe. He has also travelled to Borneo to check out palm oil plantations and visited Amazonian tribes by canoe to see for himself if it is possible to make a profit while protecting the planet. He seems keen to take on Roddick\u2019s mantle, returning to the UK with ideas for new ingredients that could be sustainably sourced from biodiversity hotspots that will both support locals and protect their environment. Roddick\u2019s ideas still make sense, he says, and are being accepted not just by L\u2019Or\u00e9al but by many other multinationals. \u201cThe idea of a company that made money but is also a force for good was laughed at 40 years ago. That\u2019s now mainstream ... Lots of people are doing corporate social responsibility now, from BMW to Coke. They have copied us. Anita was a pioneer, but we can\u2019t just say we are doing this [already]. We have to find a brand new thought.\u201d He has therefore come up with a list of 14 targets for 2020, including ensuring all its natural ingredients are traceable and sustainably sourced, compared to just under half today, and that 70% of its packaging does not come from fossil fuels, compared to 30% today. The company will report on progress annually and intends to bring in an independent body to verify how it is doing. There is also a new Body Shop catchphrase \u2013 Enrich not Exploit \u2013 and the chain also plans to double the number of \u201ccommunity trade\u201d ingredients it sources, from 19 at present. The community trade programme deals directly with small-scale farmers and artisans promising them a fair, sustainable price and community support. Other ambitious ideas include the creation of \u201cbio bridges\u201d, in which 75 million sq metres of habitat where forest has been cut away will be rejuvenated to create more sustainable habitat for wildlife. The first project in Vietnam will involve protecting 20 million sq metres of biodiversity-rich forest \u2013 one square metre protected for every customer transaction. Schwartz says future areas for \u201cbio bridges\u201d might include the US, Indonesia, Sweden and Saudi Arabia. One thing missing from the list is the kind of hard-hitting campaign Roddick championed. She backed Greenpeace\u2019s Save the Whale mission, joined Amazonian indians in campaigning against a hydro-electric dam and supported the Ogoni people\u2019s battle for reparations for damage to their local environment in Nigeria by oil multinationals. Her stand against animal testing challenged the whole cosmetics industry to make changes that led to the European ban. Schwartz says Body Shop is still taking a stand, refusing to sell in China, for example, where any imported cosmetics must be tested on animals. The chain pulled out of airport duty-free stores there in 2014, after a consumer watchdog raised fears that Body Shop products could be randomly tested on animals by authorities. Sales rose 10.7% to \u20ac967m (\u00a3750m) last year, but profits slipped back 16% to \u20ac54.8m as a result of investment in stores, digital marketing and developing new skincare products and services. However, Schwartz thinks Body Shop\u2019s links to local communities around the world will continue to power its growth. \u201cWe have discovered ingredients nobody is using and are developing products with those ... I\u2019m confident we have healthy competition but we\u2019ll stay ahead,\u201d he says. This article was amended on 16 February 2016 to correct the area measurement of proposed \u201cbio-bridge\u201d rejuvenation.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that the banking sector is facing a new onslaught of pressures dominated markets last week. Global bank shares were sold off \u2013 the index of major banking shares in the UK at one point hit its lowest levels since the depths of the recession \u2013 and questions were being asked about the impact of low interest rates amid concerns about the possibility of a global economic slowdown. While much of the focus was on big banks in the eurozone \u2013 Deutsche and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 analysts pointed out that the share prices of UK banks were already pricing in another global financial crisis when it hadn\u2019t even happened. So when the UK\u2019s major players reveal in the coming weeks how they have fared in 2015, they will be doing so in the most febrile atmosphere since the Lehman Brothers collapse seven-and-a-half years ago. Analysts will be looking for confirmation that another 2008-style crisis is not about to the grip the sector. The gloom may well be overdone. The stock market value of some of Britain\u2019s biggest banks is lower than the value of their assets, notably HSBC, Standard Chartered and Barclays. HSBC \u2013 one of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100 \u2013 has been trading at levels not seen since 2009. Standard Chartered is selling for prices last witnessed a quarter of a century ago. In the depths of last weeks\u2019s market chaos, shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland hit their lowest levels since 2012 while George Osborne has already had to postpone his plan to sell off shares in Lloyds Banking Group to the public. However, the bombed-out banks came off their lows by the end of last week, and analysts point out that all hold more capital \u2013 the key measure of their financial health \u2013 than they did before the start of 2008. The results of stress tests on the major players announced in December by the Bank of England showed that they were all strong enough to withstand a downturn, and Threadneedle Street said it was not concerned about the strength of the system. Analysts have calculated that Europe\u2019s banks are holding \u20ac700m worth of capital more than they were at the time of the last crisis and have disposed of their riskiest assets. So financial strength shouldn\u2019t be a problem, and no one is expecting to hear the likes of Barclays, HSBC or Lloyds report losses. However, there are headwinds. The ability of banks to generate revenue will be a focus; the low interest rate environment is punishing them as it restricts the profits on their lending. Any sign that provisions for bad debts are starting to go up dramatically will be regarded with concern, while banks are expected to set aside more money to cover scandals, such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Investors will be watching for any impact on the payouts they receive through dividends \u2013 particularly how that compares with the total spent on staff bonuses. Many banks are expected to publish annual reports alongside their results, showing remuneration for board members. HSBC The board of Britain\u2019s biggest bank met on Sunday to decide whether to shift its headquarters out of London to another location, most likely Hong Kong. Once that decision is out of the way \u2013 with expectations that HSBC will decide to stay put \u2013 the focus returns to the 2015 results. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver last week gave clues to his view of the market outlook. As he went back on a staff pay freeze, he warned workers of the \u201cvery challenging operating environment\u201d. Gulliver is already six months into a plan to cut staff numbers by 25,000 and save $5bn (\u00a33.5bn). The City will now be wanting progress on these cost reduction measures and an update on the impact of slowing growth in China, where Gulliver is targeting expansion. So what is the problem with the underperforming share price? Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec bank, says it indicates that the City is braced for a rise in bad debts in emerging markets. In the third quarter, Gulliver stressed that while revenues were down, credit quality was not being affected. He has received at least \u00a37m a year in pay since taking the helm in 2011. His pay, and that of his 250,000 staff, will also be in focus. Standard Chartered Fears over the strength of emerging markets have been a key factor in this year\u2019s stock-market gyrations, so analysts are wondering if a bank focused on those economies can have made a profit in 2015. Standard Chartered has its own problems, which new chief executive Bill Winters has tried to address by tapping shareholders for \u00a33.3bn and putting 15,000 jobs on the line. Even so, the market is valuing the bank at 0.4 times the value of its assets, as the stock trades at a 25-year low. Winters has embarked on a major restructuring, reducing exposure to China and commodities. The bank is also being more selective about the customers to which it lends and is ending $20bn of loans to a handful of customers. Any signs that this restructuring is slowing down or that bad debts are rising could further unnerve investors, while the bank has already warned it remains in the regulatory spotlight after a 2012 fine from US authorities over breaches of sanctions. \u201cStandard Chartered\u2019s earnings have been under sustained pressure for the past two years, and we expect little respite from the full-year 2015 results,\u201d said analysts at Barclays. \u201cUnderlying earnings are likely to suffer from difficult trading conditions, a slowing economic environment and further declines in commodity prices. The recently announced restructuring is likely to add to these headwinds, disrupting underlying business performance and leading to significant restructuring charges.\u201d Lloyds Banking Group The market rout has driven shares in Lloyds to 57p, their lowest price since April 2013, quashing any short-term chance of the government further selling its stake in the bank, which was bailed out in 2008 with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money. That stake has fallen from 43% to below 10%, and the bank will hope it can convince investors that its ability to generate dividends will put fuel back into the shares. But hanging over the bank is the prospect of another provision for PPI \u2013 its bill is already over \u00a313bn. Analysts at Jefferies said the extra PPI provision, which they believe could amount to \u00a32bn in the fourth quarter, would make it difficult for Lloyds to promise any special dividends. The bank acts as a barometer of the UK economy and is also the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, so any signs that lending is slowing down or house prices tanking will worry FTSE investors. Royal Bank of Scotland The biggest casualty of the 2008 banking crisis is yet to report a full-year profit since taxpayers pumped in \u00a345bn to keep it afloat. Last month, Ross McEwan, the chief executive, admitted that 2015 would be its eighth consecutive loss-making year as the bank issued an unscheduled announcement warning ofa string of charges relating to PPI and a long list of litigation in the US relating to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The losses it has reported since 2008 already exceed the \u00a345bn used to prevent it from collapsing. Uncertainty surrounding the cost of these fines is a concern for investors, alongside penalties related to the mortgage securities cases, for which it has set aside \u00a33.8bn. This is holding back the bank\u2019s ability to make payouts to investors, which might help bolster the shares. They have plunged to 2012 lows and have been trading at 230p \u2013 100p below the price at which Osborne sold off the first tranche in August. Barclays Shares are back where they were when former chief executive Bob Diamond was forced out during the 2012 Libor-rigging scandal. Antony Jenkins, promoted to replace Diamond, has also been ousted and replaced with the US banker Jes Staley, who will be making his first presentation when the bank announces its 2015 results. He is facing calls to embark on a major overhaul. Analysts at stockbroker Bernstein have already urged him to get Barclays out of Africa, sell the US credit card business and float the investment bank in the US. The investment bank, once its powerhouse, is likely to be the focus. Investec\u2019s Gordon says Barclays has already signalled that investment banking revenues fell 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. Some 1,200 job cuts in the division have already been earmarked and more focus on cost-cutting its expected. In addition, Staley faces a major challenge in complying with UK rules requiring banks to ringfence their high-street banks from their investment banking operations. Analysts at Jefferies expect Barclays to incur another \u00a31bn of costs to implement the ringfence and another \u00a31bn PPI charge for the last three months of 2015.",

Analysts will be looking for confirmation that another 2008-style crisis is not about to the grip the sector.</p> <p>The gloom may well be overdone. The stock market value of some of Britain\u2019s biggest banks is lower than the value of their assets, notably HSBC, Standard Chartered and Barclays. HSBC \u2013 one of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100 \u2013 has been trading at levels not seen since 2009. Standard Chartered is selling for prices last witnessed a quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>In the depths of last weeks\u2019s market chaos, shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland hit their lowest levels since 2012 while George Osborne has already <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/preview/business/2016/jan/28/george-osborne-postpones-sale-sell-off-last-publicly-owned-lloyds-bank-shares\" title=\"\">had to postpone his plan to sell off shares in Lloyds Banking Group to the public.</a></p> <p>However, the bombed-out banks came off their lows by the end of last week, and analysts point out that all hold more capital \u2013 the key measure of their financial health \u2013 than they did before the start of 2008.</p> <p>The results of stress tests on the major players announced in December by the Bank of England showed that they were all strong enough to withstand a downturn, and Threadneedle Street <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/bank-stress-tests-rbs-and-standard-chartered-weakest-in-crash-scenario\" title=\"\">said it was not concerned about the strength of the system</a>. Analysts have calculated that Europe\u2019s banks are holding \u20ac700m worth of capital more than they were at the time of the last crisis and have disposed of their riskiest assets. So financial strength shouldn\u2019t be a problem, and no one is expecting to hear the likes of Barclays, HSBC or Lloyds report losses.</p> <p>However, there are headwinds. The ability of banks to generate revenue will be a focus; the low interest rate environment is punishing them as it restricts the profits on their lending. Any sign that provisions for bad debts are starting to go up dramatically will be regarded with concern, while banks are expected to set aside more money to cover scandals, such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Investors will be watching for any impact on the payouts they receive through dividends \u2013 particularly how that compares with the total spent on staff bonuses. Many banks are expected to publish annual reports alongside their results, showing remuneration for board members.</p> <h2><strong>HSBC</strong></h2> <p>The board of Britain\u2019s biggest bank met on Sunday to decide whether to shift its headquarters out of London to another location, most likely Hong Kong. Once that decision is out of the way \u2013 with expectations that HSBC will decide to stay put \u2013 the focus returns to the 2015 results. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver last week gave clues to his view of the market outlook. As he went back on a staff pay freeze, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/11/hsbc-axes-2016-pay-freeze-after-staff-protests\" title=\"\">he warned workers of the \u201cvery challenging operating environment\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Gulliver is already six months into a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/09/hsbc-cuts-25000-jobs-globally\" title=\"\">plan to cut staff numbers by 25,000</a> and save $5bn (\u00a33.5bn). The City will now be wanting progress on these cost reduction measures and an update on the impact of slowing growth in China, where Gulliver is targeting expansion.</p> <p>So what is the problem with the underperforming share price? Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec bank, says it indicates that the City is braced for a rise in bad debts in emerging markets.</p> <p>In the third quarter, Gulliver stressed that while revenues were down, credit quality was not being affected. He has received at least \u00a37m a year in pay since taking the helm in 2011. His pay, and that of his 250,000 staff, will also be in focus.</p> <h2><strong>Standard Chartered</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb9d263649f14a03c7b36f4eb5d5edf99c2891d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb9d263649f14a03c7b36f4eb5d5edf99c2891d/313_250_4496_2696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s Hong Kong headquarters: new chief executive Bill Winters has been seeking \u00a33.3bn from shareholders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s Hong Kong headquarters: new chief executive Bill Winters has been seeking \u00a33.3bn from shareholders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fears over the strength of emerging markets have been a key factor in this year\u2019s stock-market gyrations, so analysts are wondering if a bank focused on those economies can have made a profit in 2015. Standard Chartered has its own problems, which new chief executive Bill Winters has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/03/standard-chartered-seeks-billions-from-investors\" title=\"\"> tried to address by tapping shareholders for \u00a33.3bn and putting 15,000 jobs on the line</a>. Even so, the market is valuing the bank at 0.4 times the value of its assets, as the stock trades at a 25-year low. Winters has embarked on a major restructuring, reducing exposure to China and commodities.</p> <p>The bank is also being more selective about the customers to which it lends and is ending $20bn of loans to a handful of customers. Any signs that this restructuring is slowing down or that bad debts are rising could further unnerve investors, while the bank has already warned it remains in the regulatory spotlight after a 2012 fine from US authorities over breaches of sanctions.</p> <p>\u201cStandard Chartered\u2019s earnings have been under sustained pressure for the past two years, and we expect little respite from the full-year 2015 results,\u201d said analysts at Barclays. \u201cUnderlying earnings are likely to suffer from difficult trading conditions, a slowing economic environment and further declines in commodity prices. The recently announced restructuring is likely to add to these headwinds, disrupting underlying business performance and leading to significant restructuring charges.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong></h2> <p>The market rout has driven shares in Lloyds to 57p, their lowest price since April 2013, quashing any short-term chance of the government further selling its stake in the bank, which was bailed out in 2008 with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money. That stake has fallen from 43% to below 10%, and the bank will hope it can convince investors that its ability to generate dividends will put fuel back into the shares. But hanging over the bank is the prospect of another provision for PPI \u2013 its bill is already over \u00a313bn. Analysts at Jefferies said the extra PPI provision, which they believe could amount to \u00a32bn in the fourth quarter, would make it difficult for Lloyds to promise any special dividends.</p> <p>The bank acts as a barometer of the UK economy and is also the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, so any signs that lending is slowing down or house prices tanking will worry FTSE investors.</p> <h2><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong></h2> <p>The biggest casualty of the 2008 banking crisis is yet to report a full-year profit since taxpayers pumped in \u00a345bn to keep it afloat. Last month, Ross McEwan, the chief executive, admitted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/27/rbs-royal-bank-scotland-chief-executive-announces-clean-up\" title=\"\">that 2015 would be its eighth consecutive loss-making year</a> as the bank issued an unscheduled announcement warning ofa string of charges relating to PPI and a long list of litigation in the US relating to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).</p> <p>The losses it has reported since 2008 already exceed the \u00a345bn used to prevent it from collapsing. Uncertainty surrounding the cost of these fines is a concern for investors, alongside penalties related to the mortgage securities cases, for which it has set aside \u00a33.8bn. This is holding back the bank\u2019s ability to make payouts to investors, which might help bolster the shares. They have plunged to 2012 lows and have been trading at 230p \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\" title=\"\">100p below the price at which Osborne sold off the first tranche in August</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dea1253746d09705bb31c11e8d891b86bf1cfc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dea1253746d09705bb31c11e8d891b86bf1cfc1/0_17_1944_1167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross McEwan of RBS\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross McEwan of RBS: eight straight years of losses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Barclays</strong></h2> <p>Shares are back where they were<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/bob-diamond-quits-barclays-libor-scandal\" title=\"\"> when former chief executive Bob Diamond was forced out during the 2012 Libor-rigging scandal.</a> Antony Jenkins, promoted to replace Diamond, has also been ousted and replaced with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">the US banker Jes Staley, </a>who will be making his first presentation when the bank announces its 2015 results.</p> <p>He is facing calls to embark on a major overhaul. Analysts at stockbroker Bernstein have already urged him to get Barclays out of Africa, sell the US credit card business and float the investment bank in the US.</p> <p>The investment bank, once its powerhouse, is likely to be the focus. Investec\u2019s Gordon says Barclays has already signalled that investment banking revenues fell 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. Some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/barclays-axe-1200-investment-bank-jobs-worldwide\" title=\"\">1,200 job cuts in the division have already been earmarked</a> and more focus on cost-cutting its expected.</p> <p>In addition, Staley faces a major challenge in complying with UK rules requiring banks to ringfence their high-street banks from their investment banking operations. Analysts at Jefferies expect Barclays to incur another \u00a31bn of costs to implement the ringfence and another \u00a31bn PPI charge for the last three months of 2015.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in turmoil. Nervous investors seeking out safe havens for their money. Rumours swirling about the vulnerability of some of the world\u2019s biggest banks. February 2016 is starting to smell suspiciously like early September 2008 and the days before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. To be sure, the comparison between now and that September seven-and-a-half years ago, when the global financial crisis came to a head, is not exact. The big banks say they are better equipped to withstand losses now, a view supported by their official regulators. Rising energy prices were squeezing real incomes in the summer of 2008, but today consumers and businesses are getting quite a windfall from the drop in the price of crude. But there have now been six weeks of unrelenting turmoil in the financial markets since the start of 2016 and the argument that this represents a fleeting spasm of panic before life returns to normal is wearing thin. The sell-off in shares, the collapse in commodity prices and the flight to gold have forced a long overdue reassessment of the sustainability of the uneven recovery that has been under way since spring 2009. One lesson from those dark days of crisis is that the time to start worrying is when bank bosses feel obliged to insist publicly that their institutions are rock solid. The story starts with China and the fear that the problems of the world\u2019s second biggest economy mark the third iteration of the global crisis that began in the US in 2007, and subsequently moved to the eurozone in 2010. Like the US, and some peripheral eurozone countries, China pumped up its economic growth using cheap credit and is now finding that many of the loans are going sour. The economy is clearly slowing, with debate over whether China is expanding at close to 7% a year, as the official figures suggest, or a much lower rate. Danny Gabay, who runs the Fathom consultancy, thinks the real rate of growth could be 3% or lower. Countries that supply commodities \u2013 from Angola to Australia \u2013 did well out of China\u2019s industrial boom. They could sell all the oil, aluminium, iron ore and copper they could produce at premium prices. Many of these countries \u2013 especially the ones that spent and borrowed freely in the expectation that high commodity prices would last forever \u2013 now look vulnerable. So when the sell-off in the markets started in January, the main concern was that the slowdown in China and the crash in commodity prices would have a domino effect on some of the weaker emerging-market economies. That source of anxiety remains, but has now been pushed slightly into the background by speculation about the health of the big European banks. Four separate factors have come together. Firstly, eurozone banks still have a lot of non-performing loans on their books from the last crisis. Secondly, the belief is that they have lent money for shale oil exploration and high-end property deals that will make losses. Thirdly, weaker growth prospects are hurting profitability. Finally, the increased use of negative interest rates is adding to financial pressures, because it now costs the banks to deposit cash at central banks. In past economic cycles, central banks had no need for recourse to unconventional tools such as negative interest rates and quantitative easing. The fact that they are still being used seven years after recovery worries investors \u2013 and rightly so. Central banks feel obliged to take action to prevent the deflation caused by China\u2019s slowdown and the big fall in oil prices from becoming entrenched. But some of the unpleasant side effects of QE and ultra-low interest rates are now becoming obvious: QE pumps up asset-price bubbles through its encouragement of reckless lending, while low and negative interest rates add to financial pressures on commercial banks. To sum up, the past seven-and-a-half years have seen the most colossal use of monetary stimulus in recorded history, yet recovery has been weak by past standards and has been accompanied by a drift towards deflation. As policy becomes ever more unconventional, markets are starting to think central banks have lost control of the situation. The fundamental problems of the pre-crash economy \u2013 rising income inequality, over-reliance on debt, weak effective demand \u2013 have not been solved: merely papered over.",
