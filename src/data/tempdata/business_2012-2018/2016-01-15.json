      "bodyText": "US stock markets suffered further heavy losses on Friday with the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500, the index of America\u2019s biggest companies, falling 2.2% to 1,880 points \u2013 the lowest since August 2014. The losses, which follow declines across the world due to concerns about the health of the Chinese economy and the plunging price of oil, extend the US markets\u2019 worst-ever start to the year. The Dow Jones, which fell by more than 500 points at one point before ending the day down 391 points to 15,988, has fallen by 8.24% so far in 2016. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 has lost more than 8% in the past two weeks and the Nasdaq index of technology stocks is down 10.4%. Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest private investment fund, warned that he expected the market to crash even further in the next few weeks. \u201cI actually believe there\u2019s not enough blood in the streets,\u201d Mr Fink told CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to test the markets lower, and I think when we test the markets lower it\u2019s going to be a pretty good buying opportunity.\u201d Fink said the markets\u2019 decline has put \u201ca negativity across the economy, a negativity to every CEO looking at his or her stock price, a negativity about business\u201d. He also warned that the oil price, which on Friday settled below $30 for the first time in 12 years, could fall as far as $25 a barrel or lower. \u201cInvestors are scared to death, and the fact that it\u2019s happening at the beginning of the year has some historical significance,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. It was a broad sell-off with each of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones index down on the day, and every stock except Walmart is in the red for the year so far. Analysts said the share market drops were fuelled by fears about the health of the Chinese and US economies and the continued slide in the oil price. The price of oil, which is down 20% so far this year, crashed a further 6% on Friday. The oil price fall, which began over concerns about the rout on Chinese stock markets, has been exacerbated by traders\u2019 expectations of the market being flooded by Iranian exports following the lifting of sanctions. Tehran is expected to target India and Europe with increased exports once sanctions are lifted. The first two weeks of 2016 has been the worst two-week decline for oil since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cMarkets have to go through several stages and right now they\u2019re just holding their head and crying,\u201d Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds in New York, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThe drama and issue overnight is more related to oil prices not finding a floor. If it was just China and everything else was OK, we\u2019d see through that. But when China is down and oil drops every day, the market recognizes it has substantial issues.\u201d Sam Stovall, managing director of US equity strategy at S&amp;P Capital IQ, said: \u201cThe sentiment is dominated by fear. Ahead of a long weekend, no one wants to be exposed.\u201d Wall Street will be closed on Monday, for Martin Luther King Day. The falling oil price and disappointing retail sales data released on Friday have pushed back expectations of when the Federal Reserve will next increase interest rates, following the first rate rise in almost a decade in December. Fed funds futures show rates are now more likely to raise in September rather than June, as the odds suggested on Thursday. Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve and the second-most important US central banker after Janet Yellen, said the lower oil price and strong dollar have increased the risk of US inflation heading lower and thereby extending the time it will take to reach the Fed\u2019s goal of 2%. \u201cWith respect to the risks to the inflation outlook, the most concerning is the possibility that inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside,\u201d he said in a speech to the New Jersey Bankers Association. To add to already heightened concerns about the economy, US government figures on Friday showed that retail sales declined in December to make 2015 the worst year for US shops since 2009. The Commerce Department said retail sales dropped 0.1% compared to November, which benefitted from Black Friday shopping fever. Total sales for 2015 came in 2.1% higher than 2014, but it was the slowest annual growth since 2009. \u201cWeather, inventory challenges, advances in consumer technology and the deep discounts that started earlier in the season and that have carried into January presented stiff headwinds as retailers competed with one another and their own bottom line,\u201d said Matthew Shay, president and chief executive of the National Retail Federation. Dudley said the retail data pointed towards a \u201crelatively weak\u201d fourth quarter for overall GDP growth. Stock markets across the rest of the world also declined sharply on Friday, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 and France\u2019s CAC down 2% and Germany\u2019s Dax down 2.4%.",

    "webTitle": "Fiat Chrysler CEO: US can make cars that meet 54.5mpg fuel efficiency standard", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US car industry has the technology to make future vehicles meet the federal 54.5-mile per gallon average fuel economy requirement scheduled to arrive in 2025, the CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles told journalists at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this week. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with owning ambitious targets,\u201d Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference at the show, which opens to the public on Saturday. \u201cYou can see it here with all this hype about hybrids and self-driving cars and everything else; technology is undoubtedly available to make those numbers.\u201d What was in question, Marchionne said, was the cost of meeting the new standards, and how increased cost would affect demand for vehicles in the US. Low fuel prices over the past few years have led to increased demand for larger vehicles, which take more power to move and offer a bigger profit margin. But building engines and other key components of a vehicle designed to get better fuel economy is expensive, Marchionne said. Other automakers have been employing various strategies to ramp up fuel economy. Toyota, currently the world\u2019s largest automaker, has been a strong proponent of hydrogen fuel cell technology. There is not much of a fueling infrastructure for hydrogen in the US outside of southern California, so the automaker \u2013 already known as the producer of the bestselling hybrid in the US, the Prius \u2013 has also developed hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles to round out its portfolio and lower overall fuel consumption. \u201cToyota takes a long-term view on product decisions,\u201d Corey Proffitt, a spokesman for the company, said in an email. \u201cFuel prices are currently low, but we know they will ebb and flow over time.\u201d David Albritton, a spokesman for General Motors\u2019 product development division, said in an email that the three main areas to focus on when trying to make vehicles more fuel efficient were reducing aerodynamic drag, reducing weight and improving mechanical efficiency. \u201cWe do not believe there is a single solution,\u201d he said, adding that GM was using direct fuel injection, cylinder deactivation (turning a V8 or V6 engine temporarily into a V4 when maximum power is not needed), turbocharging, start-stop technology (the engine shuts down when the vehicle is stopped at an intersection) and transmissions with eight, nine and 10 speeds to increase efficiency in its high-volume models. \u201cBroadly speaking, intensive use of lightweight materials can be expected.\u201d The key, Albritton said, would be customer acceptance of new technologies and the added cost associated with them. He pointed out that low fuel prices posed a challenge in getting customers to opt for more efficient cars and trucks. Jeff Jowett, an analyst with IHS Automotive, said in an interview that meeting the new standards was going to require greater electrification across the entire US vehicle fleet. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a big challenge; especially with low gas prices,\u201d he said, adding that there hasn\u2019t been any indication that prices would increase significantly within the next several years. \u201cWhen you have low gas prices, you don\u2019t have the natural pull from consumers to spur development of electric technology.\u201d Jowett named a number of other technologies that were making vehicles more efficient. Among them were grille shutters to improve aerodynamics and more efficient air conditioning systems. He also explained that the 2025 fuel economy number that\u2019s most often quoted \u2013 54.5mpg \u2013 is misleading. The real number, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that include more real-world driving parameters, is about 49mpg. \u201cThe EPA number is based upon two-cycle testing that came about 30 years ago, when the national speed limit was 55 miles per hour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take cold weather testing, air conditioning use and other factors into account.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is on the side of the banks and not those who rely on them, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said, responding to reports that the chancellor cut the bank levy after sustained lobbying from the City. McDonnell said the reports were \u201cyet another example of how George Osborne dances to the tune of whatever the bankers call for, and everyone else is a second thought\u201d. Following freedom of information requests, the Evening Standard reported on Friday that the CBI, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and the British Bankers\u2019 Association all called on the government to lower the levy after it was first introduced in 2010 in response to the financial crisis. In his July budget, Osborne announced that the levy \u2013 which has raised over \u00a38bn since 2010 \u2013 would be reduced from 0.21% to 0.1% by 2021 and would only apply to the UK balance sheets of banks. \u201cThe chancellor has an ever softer touch on the banks; cutting the bank levy, slashing corporation tax, selling the publicly owned banks off at a loss, watering down the regulations on senior bankers and staying silent when the watchdog he set up watered down its review into the sector,\u201d said McDonnell. \u201cCustomers and taxpayers who bailed out the banks and continue to pay the price for their past actions and excesses will see this as yet more proof that George Osborne is simply on the side of those who run the banks and not those who rely on them.\u201d Responding to complaints from banks that the levy had frequently been raised without warning, Osborne in July set out a timetable for reductions from 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016 and 0.17% from January 2017, before reaching 0.1% from January 2021. The levy has previously been based on banks\u2019 global balance sheets, but will be changed to focus only on their UK operations from 2021. The Conservative manifesto ahead of last May\u2019s general election pledged that the levy \u2013 which had been increased nine times \u2013 would be permanent. Following Osborne\u2019s announcement to change it, City analysts estimated the changes would save major international banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered almost \u00a31bn in tax a year. A spokeswoman for the Treasury told the Evening Standard that \u201cany suggestion of undue influence is wrong.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is on the side of the banks and not those who rely on them, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said, responding to reports that the chancellor cut the bank levy after sustained lobbying from the City. </p> <p>McDonnell said the reports were \u201cyet another example of how George Osborne dances to the tune of whatever the bankers call for, and everyone else is a second thought\u201d.</p> <p>Following freedom of information requests, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/bank-levy-watered-down-after-firms-paying-no-uk-tax-put-pressure-on-chancellor-a3157261.html\">the Evening Standard reported on Friday</a> that the CBI, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and the British Bankers\u2019 Association all called on the government to lower the levy after it was first introduced in 2010 in response to the financial crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy\">In his July budget</a>, Osborne announced that the levy \u2013 which has raised over \u00a38bn since 2010 \u2013 would be reduced from 0.21% to 0.1% by 2021 and would only apply to the UK balance sheets of banks. </p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor has an ever softer touch on the banks; cutting the bank levy, slashing corporation tax, selling the publicly owned banks off at a loss, watering down the regulations on senior bankers and staying silent when the watchdog he set up watered down its review into the sector,\u201d said McDonnell.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers and taxpayers who bailed out the banks and continue to pay the price for their past actions and excesses will see this as yet more proof that George Osborne is simply on the side of those who run the banks and not those who rely on them.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to complaints from banks that the levy had frequently been raised without warning, Osborne in July set out a timetable for reductions from 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016 and 0.17% from January 2017, before reaching 0.1% from January 2021. The levy has previously been based on banks\u2019 global balance sheets, but will be changed to focus only on their UK operations from 2021. </p> <p>The Conservative manifesto ahead of last May\u2019s general election pledged that the levy \u2013 which had been increased nine times \u2013 would be permanent. Following Osborne\u2019s announcement to change it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/budget-means-hsbc-and-standard-chartered-banks-will-pay-1bn-less-in-tax\">City analysts estimated the changes would save major international banks </a>such as HSBC and Standard Chartered almost \u00a31bn in tax a year.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Treasury told the Evening Standard that \u201cany suggestion of undue influence is wrong.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Its specialist action cameras allow surfers, skiers and other thrillseekers to record their exploits. The devices have been strapped to eagles to give a real bird\u2019s eye view of the landscape, and can even be attached to a specially designed harness so that dog owners can view the world through the eyes of their pet. When GoPro floated its shares on Wall Street in June 2014, there seemed to be no limit to how high they might go. Snapped up at $24 a share by an eager investing public, the shares rocketed to $94 as investors backed the US company\u2019s vision of fun videos and fast-growing revenues. The company was valued at $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) on flotation and its chief executive, Nick Woodman, scooped $86m by selling part of his stake in the deal. This week, the group\u2019s shares lurched dramatically downwards. On Wednesday, they plunged 28% to just more than $12 as the group said sales were not meeting targets and it would miss revenue projections by around 14%for the calendar year. The problems are centred on GoPro\u2019s Hero4 Session \u2013 a new camera released last year small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. But buyers balked at the $399 launch price. GoPro cut the price to $299, and then again to $199 (about \u00a3170 in the UK ) in a bid to boost sales. Cheap Chinese competition, from firms like Xiaomi, is another headache. And spooking investors further, the group said it would cut its workforce by around 7%, costing it between $5-10m in restructuring expenses. The statement was more bad news for investors who have been disappointed time and again in recent months. The shares dropped below the issue price of $24 for the first time in November. Over the whole of 2015 they were down 70% . Citi analyst Jeremy David slashed his price target last month from $75 to $22, saying the GoPro novelty may be wearing off: \u201cWe are becoming worried that poor sell thru could be a reflection of diminishing consumer interest in new GoPro devices.\u201d After this week\u2019s news, he\u2019s reduced his target further, to $12. Woodman dreamed up the idea for GoPro during a surfing trip after the digital marketing firm he started after college became a casualty of the dot-com collapse. At the time of the float his GoPro shareholding was valued at around $1.3bn. Now it\u2019s worth around half that. Needless to say, shareholders have been left unimpressed and are reaching for their lawyers. At least one law firm has started legal action, claiming that the company\u2019s management has been too slow to warn investors about its deteriorating sales prospects. Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro\u2019s management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u2013 specifically with reference to sales of the group\u2019s Hero camera range. For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \u201cWhile that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u2013 extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\u201d That overreaction, he says, \u201cis one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\u201d he says. GoPro\u2019s statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon\u2019s shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015. GoPro\u2019s management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return. Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \u201cToday isn\u2019t the type of day we\u2019re used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u2026 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\u201d How the tech giants have fared All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year. Facebook Shares in Facebook performed strongly in 2016, finishing the year 33% up. But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they\u2019re trading around $98, which is way above the social media group\u2019s $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012. Amazon Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability. Netflix Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia. Alphabet (formerly known as Google) Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google\u2019s search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple. Twitter Twitter\u2019s share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform\u2019s slowing user growth and they aren\u2019t yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model. Apple Apple\u2019s shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn.",

      "bodyText": "Turn the clock back a month. It is the week before Christmas and the Federal Reserve has just raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The mood in the markets is upbeat. A so-called Santa rally is in full swing. Dealers say the US central bank has played a blinder by keeping Wall Street sweet. If there were Oscars for central bankers, Janet Yellen would be picking up the golden statuette. Four weeks and one market meltdown later, the Fed\u2019s decision no longer looks quite so clever. Indeed, if things continue as they have since the turn of 2016, the increase in US interest rates will go down in the annals as one of the great economic blunders. The rationale for higher borrowing costs always looked questionable. Interest rates were pushed up not because inflation was a problem but because the Fed expected inflation to be a problem some time in the future. Sure, unemployment was coming down, but wage growth was not going up. Yellen and her colleagues had a choice. They could act pre-emptively and raise rates while inflation was low, or they could wait until they could see the whites of inflation\u2019s eyes. They chose the former and they chose wrong. Almost all the data since the Fed raised rates has been weak. Plunging oil prices were supposed to encourage consumers to spend, but they are saving rather than spending the windfall. Retail sales fell in December and for 2015 as a whole were at their weakest since 2009. Corporate profitability has been falling and up until now share prices have been artificially inflated by companies buying back their own stock. Industrial production also fell in December, partly as a consequence of the strong dollar, which is making US exports dearer and imported goods cheaper. The month-on-month fall was the steepest since 2008, but perhaps even more worryingly every other time industrial production has been this low the US has been in recession. Other central banks have been here before. The European Central Bank raised rates in 2011 only to later reverse the decision as the eurozone economy tanked. The Swedish central bank did the same. Wall Street currently estimates that there is a 10% chance that the Fed will reverse the December rate increase later this month. The Fed has got a great dollop of egg all over its face.",

Indeed, if things continue as they have since the turn of 2016, the increase in US interest rates will go down in the annals as one of the great economic blunders.</p> <p>The rationale for higher borrowing costs always looked questionable. Interest rates were pushed up not because inflation was a problem but because the Fed expected inflation to be a problem some time in the future. Sure, unemployment was coming down, but wage growth was not going up. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/us-stock-markets-fall-dow-oil-prices-china\">US stock markets take a major fall as Dow reaches lowest level since 2014</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yellen and her colleagues had a choice.

Plunging oil prices were supposed to encourage consumers to spend, but they are saving rather than spending the windfall. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/jan/15/oil-prices-slide-back-towards-30-heading-for-10-weekly-loss-business-live\">Retail sales fell in December</a> and for 2015 as a whole were at their weakest since 2009.</p> <p>Corporate profitability has been falling and up until now share prices have been artificially inflated by companies buying back their own stock. Industrial production also fell in December, partly as a consequence of the strong dollar, which is making US exports dearer and imported goods cheaper. The month-on-month fall was the steepest since 2008, but perhaps even more worryingly every other time industrial production has been this low the US has been in recession.</p> <p>Other central banks have been here before. The European Central Bank raised rates in 2011 only to later reverse the decision as the eurozone economy tanked. The Swedish central bank did the same. Wall Street currently estimates that there is a 10% chance that the Fed will reverse the December rate increase later this month. The Fed has got a great dollop of egg all over its face. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Two former bankers at the Co-operative Bank have been banned by the Bank of England from holding senior positions in the City after being found to have posed an unacceptable threat to the company\u2019s financial position. The Bank is fining Barry Tootell, a former Co-op Bank chief executive, \u00a3173,802, and Keith Alderson, who ran the corporate and business banking division, \u00a388,890. This is the first time Threadneedle Street has used its new powers to take action against individuals and Tootell is the first boss of any bank to be formally censured since the 2008 crisis. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, said: \u201cBanks that are not well governed have the potential to pose a threat to UK financial stability. The actions of Mr Tootell and Mr Alderson posed an unacceptable threat to the safety and soundness of the Co-op Bank, which is why we have decided a prohibition is appropriate in these cases.\u201d The Co-op Bank had to be bailed out by hedge funds when a \u00a31.5bn hole appeared in its books in 2013 . It also left the bank open to scrutiny of the way it was run; its former chairman Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister, was later ordered to pay \u00a3525 after admitting possession of drugs including cocaine and crystal meth. Tootell was acting chief executive for 14 months before getting the role full-time in September 2012 but was placed on gardening leave in May 2013 following the bank\u2019s downgrade to junk status. He was paid \u00a3623,000 by the time he formally left at the end of 2013. The Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found Tootell contributed to a culture at the bank that focused on the short-term financial position. The PRA said he did not adequately oversee the corporate loan book the Co-op took on when it merged with Britannia in 2009. The period of censure covers January 2009 and May 2013. It cites moves by him to change bad debt charges, which in one instance which had the effect of maintaining the bonus pool although the Bank does not say this was his motivation. Alderson, whose role has been subject to little public scrutiny until now, was found not to have properly assessed the risks from the Britannia loans nor escalated any concerns about the scale of impairments or bad debts. The regulator said his income was \u00a3423,000 and his period of censure covers August 2009 and May 2013. The PRA said: \u201cThe Co-op Bank\u2019s culture resulted in an environment in which some staff felt under pressure to meet impairment forecasts that had previously been set .\u201d The regulator accepted that Alderson did not intentionally place pressure on staff to modify the bad debt provisions and that the origins of the problem lay in the Britannia business. The Bank of England did not find Tootell or Alderson deliberately or recklessly breached the rules and did not make findings of dishonesty or lack of integrity in issuing the bans and fines. The Financial Conduct Authority is still investigating and a formal review promised in November 2013 by George Osborne into what went wrong at the bank cannot begin until the FCA has completed its work. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual cases. While we have previously indicated that work will not start on the review until it is clear it will have no prejudicial effect on any future cases, we are not at that stage yet,\u201d the FCA said. In August, the two City regulators let the bank off a fine even though they found it had misled investors and pursued growth at the expense of its financial stability. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe Prudential Regulatory Authority has censured two executives for putting short-term profits ahead of the long term sustainability of the bank, but there was clearly also a failure on the part of the whole board.\u201d The Co-op Bank has already taken steps under previous rules to withdraw \u00a35m of bonuses from a number of employees and there is no prospect of clawing back any more bonuses. \u201cThe findings relate to previous management and the current management team continues to progress the turnaround, having raised additional capital, achieved considerable de-risking and improved brand metrics,\u201d the Co-op Bank said.",

    "webTitle": "Walmart to shutter 269 stores, with most located in the US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Walmart is closing 269 stores, more than half of them in the US and another big chunk in its challenging Brazilian market. The stores being shuttered account for a fraction of the company\u2019s 11,000 stores worldwide and less than 1% of its global revenue, but according to workers\u2019 group Making Change at Walmart, this announcement will affect 10,000 US employees. More than 95% of the stores set to be closed in the US are within 10 miles of another Walmart. The Bentonville, Arkansas, company said it is working to ensure that workers are placed in nearby locations. The store closures will start at the end of the month, and many closures will be of the company\u2019s Walmart Express stores: all 102 of them (out of the 154 locations to be shuttered in the US). In 2011, Walmart Express marked the retailer\u2019s first entry into the convenience store arena. The stores are about 12,000 square feet and sell essentials like toothpaste. But the concept never caught on as the stores served the same purpose as Walmart\u2019s larger Neighborhood Markets: fill-in trips and prescription pickups. The announcement comes three months after Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors that the world\u2019s largest retailer would review its fleet of stores with the goal of becoming more nimble in the face of increased competition from all fronts, including from online rival Amazon.com. \u201cActively managing our portfolio of assets is essential to maintaining a healthy business,\u201d McMillon said in a statement. \u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision. But it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future.\u201d Walmart operates 4,500 in the US. Its global workforce is 2.2 million, 1.4 million in the US alone. Walmart has warned that its earnings for the fiscal year starting next month will be down as much as 12% as it invests further in online operations and pours money into improving customers\u2019 experience. Also covered in the closures are 23 Neighborhood Markets, 12 supercenters, seven stores in Puerto Rico, six discount stores and four Sam\u2019s Clubs. \u201cWhile it pretends to value its employees, the reality is, for Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director for Making Change at Walmart (MCAW). \u201cSadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning. This sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next \u2013 and with no one standing up for them, that is no doubt the reality.\u201d In October of last year, Walmart issued a profit warning and cut its sales outlook for 2015. At the time, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, said Walmart\u2019s plans to raise hourly wages accounted for 75% of the lower earnings target. Earlier in 2015, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million of its employees, paying them at least $9 an hour \u2013 $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The company plans to further increase their pay to $10 an hour this year. While MCAW has lauded the pay hikes as a step in the right direction, the workers\u2019 group said it would continue to fight for $15 an hour and full-time schedules. \u201cNow more than ever, Walmart\u2019s workers must work together to change Walmart for the better. Clearly, the livelihoods of all Walmart employees depend on it,\u201d Levin said on Friday. Walmart will now focus in the US on supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, the e-commerce business and pickup services for shoppers. The retailer is closing 60 loss-making locations in Brazil, which account for 5% of sales in that market. Walmart, which operated 558 stores in Brazil before the closures, has struggled as the economy there has soured. Its Every Day Low price strategy has also not been able to break against heavy promotions from key rivals. The remaining 55 stores are spread elsewhere in Latin America. Walmart said that it\u2019s still sticking to its plan announced last year to open 50 to 60 supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets and seven to 10 Sam\u2019s Clubs in the US during the fiscal year that begins 1 February. Outside the US, Walmart plans to open 200 to 240 stores. The financial impact of the closures is expected to be 20 cents to 22 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations with about 19 cents to 20 cents expected to affect the current fourth quarter. The company is expected to release fourth quarter and full year results on 18 February. Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. fell $1.12, or 1.7%, to 61.94 in morning trading.

Its global workforce is 2.2 million, 1.4 million in the US alone.</p> <p>Walmart has warned that its earnings for the fiscal year starting next month will be down as much as 12% as it invests further in online operations and pours money into improving customers\u2019 experience.</p> <p>Also covered in the closures are 23 Neighborhood Markets, 12 supercenters, seven stores in Puerto Rico, six discount stores and four Sam\u2019s Clubs.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile it pretends to value its employees, the reality is, for Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director for Making Change at Walmart (MCAW). \u201cSadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning. This sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next \u2013 and with no one standing up for them, that is no doubt the reality.\u201d<br></p> <p>In October of last year, Walmart issued a profit warning and cut its sales outlook for 2015. At the time, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, said Walmart\u2019s plans to raise hourly wages accounted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/14/walmart-profits-warning-cuts-sales-outlook-2015\">75% of the lower earnings target</a>. </p> <p>Earlier in 2015, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million of its employees, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/walmart-to-raise-wages-half-a-million-workers\">paying them at least $9 an hour</a> \u2013 $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The company plans to further increase their pay to $10 an hour this year.</p> <p>While MCAW has lauded the pay hikes as a step in the right direction, the workers\u2019 group said it would continue to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/walmart-workers-protest-wages-fast-for-15-stolen-lunches\">fight for $15 an hour</a> and full-time schedules. </p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever, Walmart\u2019s workers must work together to change Walmart for the better. Clearly, the livelihoods of all Walmart employees depend on it,\u201d Levin said on Friday. </p> <p>Walmart will now focus in the US on supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, the e-commerce business and pickup services for shoppers.</p> <p>The retailer is closing 60 loss-making locations in Brazil, which account for 5% of sales in that market. Walmart, which operated 558 stores in Brazil before the closures, has struggled as the economy there has soured. Its Every Day Low price strategy has also not been able to break against heavy promotions from key rivals.</p> <p>The remaining 55 stores are spread elsewhere in Latin America.</p> <p>Walmart said that it\u2019s still sticking to its plan announced last year to open 50 to 60 supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets and seven to 10 Sam\u2019s Clubs in the US during the fiscal year that begins 1 February. Outside the US, Walmart plans to open 200 to 240 stores.</p> <p>The financial impact of the closures is expected to be 20 cents to 22 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations with about 19 cents to 20 cents expected to affect the current fourth quarter. The company is expected to release fourth quarter and full year results on 18 February.</p> <p>Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. fell $1.12, or 1.7%, to 61.94 in morning trading.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

This contributes to our country\u2019s shameful record on winter deaths \u2013 worse than colder countries like Sweden.\u201d David Hunter, an analyst with energy manager Schneider Electric, also called on the big six to slash their bills, saying he had helped at least one domestic customer to cut their tariff by \u00a3500 a year. \u201cDespite the downward trend of wholesale energy prices over the past two years, with one exception, it has been a year since they cut gas tariffs and two years since electricity tariffs were touched,\u201d he said.

There have been fears in some quarters that it might be backtracking on some of its earlier tougher proposals such as a safeguard tariff with a maximum upper limit amid opposition from the industry. Earlier this week a study from comparethemarket.com of 2,000 pensioners showed two in five of them would cut down on food and other necessities in a bid to keep the heating on and pay energy bills.

The European Union saw 13.7m car sales last year, 9.3% more than in 2014. However, sales of Volkswagen cars rose 6.1% over the same period as the company, which has admitted rigging diesel emissions tests, lost ground to its peers. The European carmakers\u2019 association, the ACEA, said last month\u2019s sales alone were up 17% on the previous December, the highest uplift during the market\u2019s 28-month recovery after the depths of the financial crisis. But the ACEA noted that the overall numbers were still only now back at 2010 figures, despite the growth. Car sales, viewed as a barometer of consumer confidence, were up in all the five big EU markets, with Spain (21%) and Italy (16%) posting the strongest growth. Sales were up 6% in the UK, whose own market recovery preceded the wider EU\u2019s, largely due to cheap financing deals. Last week the UK trade body, the SMMT, announced the fourth year of annual growth and a record number of passenger car registrations. Volkswagen\u2019s sales performance pushed its market share down to 22.5% in December, from 24.7% in the same month in 2014. Sales for all the group\u2019s brands \u2013 which also include Audi, Seat and Skoda \u2013 rose 4.7% in December, some way below the overall rate of new registrations, although the German giant remains by far the biggest player in the European market. Volkswagen admitted fitting \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to 11m vehicles worldwide to cheat tests for nitrogen oxides pollution, which could cost VW billions of dollars in fines and compensation in the US, although it has indicated it will resist similar moves in Europe. Other manufacturers saw sales rise strongly in December, particularly French rivals PSA Group, whose numbers increased by 21.4%, and Renault, up 28%. However, Renault\u2019s shares have fallen this week, following rumours that it could also be drawn directly into the emissions scandal.

      "bodyText": "The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT\u2019s contentious \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network. The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or be to the detriment ofconsumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services. It said there was little overlap between BT\u2019s mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE\u2019s mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT\u2019s network. In May 2015, the CMA started examining the deal, which takes BT back into the mobile phone market and cements its place as Britain\u2019s biggest telecoms operator. It gave provisional approval to the takeover in October and said it had since taken extra time to study objections to the deal in a complex inquiry. BT\u2019s competitors, such as TalkTalk and Vodafone, and the consumer group Which? raised objections to the takeover and BT\u2019s dominance of the UK telecoms sector. BT is buying EE from Deutsche Telekom and Orange, which will each become substantial shareholders in the UK company from the deal. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is conducting a separate review of the telecoms market, including how BT meets its obligations to give competitors access to its network. BT is the dominant provider of broadband services in the UK and EE\u2019s 27 million customers make it the largest mobile phone company. Through its Openreach division, BT also owns the infrastructure through which much of the UK\u2019s broadband is channeled via other companies such as Sky, as well as providing capacity to mobile operators to transfer data from phone masts to other networks. John Wotton, who chaired the CMA\u2019s inquiry, said: \u201cSince our provisional findings, we have taken extra time to consider responses in detail but the evidence does not show that this merger is likely to cause significant harm to competition or the interests of consumers. \u201cThe retail mobile services market in the UK is competitive, with four main mobile providers and a substantial number of smaller operators. As BT is a smaller operator in mobile, it is unlikely that the merger will have a significant effect. Similarly, EE is only a minor player in retail broadband, so again it is unlikely the merger will have a significant effect in this market.\u201d Wotton said the CMA\u2019s study was limited to the effects of the takeover of EE and that Ofcom\u2019s review was where wider concerns about the telecoms market would be addressed. BT\u2019s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said: \u201cIt is great news that the CMA has approved our acquisition of EE. We are pleased they have found there to be no significant lessening of competition following an in-depth investigation lasting more than 10 months.\u201d TalkTalk said it was not surprised at the CMA\u2019s decision but that it would give BT more power than it had before, as British Telecom, it was privatised 30 years ago. The mobile and broadband operator said that with Three planning to buy O2 there would be a further reduction in competition. TalkTalk said: \u201cIt is dangerous that the regulator has looked at this merger in isolation, given the unprecedented levels of consolidation taking place in the wider telecoms industry. \u201cGiven BT Group\u2019s increased size and scale, the need to ensure that the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure is not neglected is more important than ever, and we have every confidence that Ofcom will take this into account when considering the future structure of Openreach.\u201d Which? had said the merger could lead to worse customer service because BT and EE had poor records. It also warned that more \u201cbundled\u201d packages of services would make it harder for consumers to compare deals . The consumer group\u2019s chief executive, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cFewer players in a market is rarely a good thing, but now this deal has been approved both companies must urgently address their abysmal customer service record. The regulator will need to keep a very close eye on this to ensure consumers really do benefit from the deal and be prepared to step in if not.\u201d BT said it would issue a formal prospectus for the deal in the last week of January, with the takeover scheduled to close on 29 January. Deutsche Telekom and Orange will own 12% and 4% of BT respectively once the deal has been completed. The layrinthine saga of UK mobile phone operator ownership BT\u2019s all-clear to buy EE is the latest chapter in the labyrinthine saga of the UK\u2019s mobile phone industry. In the beginning was Cellnet. Back in 1985, when mobile phones were the size of today\u2019s personal computers, Cellnet was majority owned by BT, with Securicor (now known as G4S) owning the remainder. BT later bought out Securicor before rebranding Cellnet as O2. That business was subsequently sold to Spain\u2019s Telefonica for \u00a318bn in 2005. Early competitors for Cellnet included Mercury One 2 One, launched in 1993, and Orange. Mercury One 2 One eventually became part of Deutsche Telekom under the moniker T-Mobile. Orange changed hands multiple times until it was snapped up by France Telecom in 2000 for \u00a331bn. Orange and T-Mobile came together in 2010, when France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom agreed a deal to create Everything Everywhere (EE). Now BT is on the verge of taking over EE for \u00a312.5bn. Meanwhile O2 (containing the original BT Cellnet, don\u2019t forget) has been sold to Hong Kong firm Hutchison Whampoa, which owns mobile competitor Three, for \u00a310.25bn. Once BT has completed its deal for EE, it will own the offspring of its original competitors. Meanwhile, its original mobile business Cellnet has, over the course of three decades, transmogrified into its biggest competitor, in the shape of the combined O2 and Three. Confused?

      "body": "<p>The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT\u2019s contentious \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or be to the detriment ofconsumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services. </p> <p>It said there was little overlap between BT\u2019s mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE\u2019s mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT\u2019s network.</p> <p>In May 2015, the CMA started examining the deal, which takes BT back into the mobile phone market and cements its place as Britain\u2019s biggest telecoms operator. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/bt-takeover-of-ee-given-provisional-clearance-by-competition-watchdog\">gave provisional approval to the takeover in October</a> and said it had since taken extra time to study objections to the deal in a complex inquiry.</p> <p>BT\u2019s competitors, such as TalkTalk and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/bt-remonopolise-uk-telecoms-sector-vodafone-broadband\">Vodafone</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/which-tells-regulators-bt-acquisition-ee-harm-consumers\">the consumer group Which?</a> raised objections to the takeover and BT\u2019s dominance of the UK telecoms sector. BT is buying EE from Deutsche Telekom and Orange, which will each become substantial shareholders in the UK company from the deal.</p> <p>The communications regulator, Ofcom, is conducting a separate review of the telecoms market, including how BT meets its obligations to give competitors access to its network.</p> <p>BT is the dominant provider of broadband services in the UK and EE\u2019s 27 million customers make it the largest mobile phone company. Through its Openreach division, BT also owns the infrastructure through which much of the UK\u2019s broadband is channeled via other companies such as Sky, as well as providing capacity to mobile operators to transfer data from phone masts to other networks.</p> <p>John Wotton, who chaired the CMA\u2019s inquiry, said: \u201cSince our provisional findings, we have taken extra time to consider responses in detail but the evidence does not show that this merger is likely to cause significant harm to competition or the interests of consumers.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe retail mobile services market in the UK is competitive, with four main mobile providers and a substantial number of smaller operators. As BT is a smaller operator in mobile, it is unlikely that the merger will have a significant effect. Similarly, EE is only a minor player in retail broadband, so again it is unlikely the merger will have a significant effect in this market.\u201d</p> <p>Wotton said the CMA\u2019s study was limited to the effects of the takeover of EE and that Ofcom\u2019s review was where wider concerns about the telecoms market would be addressed.</p> <p>BT\u2019s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said: \u201cIt is great news that the CMA has approved our acquisition of EE. We are pleased they have found there to be no significant lessening of competition following an in-depth investigation lasting more than 10 months.\u201d</p> <p>TalkTalk said it was not surprised at the CMA\u2019s decision but that it would give BT more power than it had before, as British Telecom, it was privatised 30 years ago.

      "bodyText": "The mood in the bar of the Bell on Shepton Mallet high street was grim. \u201cIt\u2019s just crap, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Martin Farthing as he finished off a lunchtime pint of Blackthorn. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money. They don\u2019t care about tradition, they don\u2019t care about what cider means to us.\u201d The news that the Shepton Mallet cider mill is to stop producing a drink synonymous with this corner of south-west Britain has not gone down well with cider drinkers in the Somerset town. Mike Taft, landlord of the Bell, was tucking into his first pint of the day. \u201cThey are throwing away our heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crying shame for Somerset cider, a crying shame for everyone who works there, terrible for the town.\u201d The mill is owned by Irish drinks company C&amp;C, which also owns Magners. It said that Somerset apples will still be pressed and pulped in Shepton Mallet but the concentrate will then be shipped to Ireland, where it will be turned into cider before being transported back to its key West Country market and the rest of the UK. It means drinks such as Somerset Snuffler, Taunton Traditional, Ye Olde English, Addlestones and Blackthorn, will no longer be made in the Mendips but in Clonmel, the county town of Tipperary. In Somerset, 120 people will lose their jobs, many of whom have worked at the mill for decades. Only four full-time and eight seasonal jobs will remain. \u201cPeople are devastated,\u201d said Steve Faulkner, a Unite senior shop steward. \u201cIt was a shock. The announcement came out of the blue. Cider has been produced at this site for centuries. To take our product from Somerset to Ireland is unbelievable. You can\u2019t make Somerset cider in Ireland. It doesn\u2019t make sense to us. \u201cFaceless people make decisions like this after looking at facts and figure, pie charts and graphs. They forget the human element, the people who work here and don\u2019t seem to think about the heritage. Shepton Mallet is going to lose a major employer but also a big part of its identity.\u201d At the smoking shelter outside the mill, workers spoke of their pride at their work and expressed fear over their job prospects. \u201cI\u2019ve been here more than 30 years,\u201d said one worker. \u201cI\u2019m gutted. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do now. I\u2019m proud to be a cider maker. I like going to the pub after your shift and seeing people enjoying what you\u2019ve produced.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bleak,\u201d said another who had been here for almost 20 years and has a large family to support. \u201cI started here after school, I don\u2019t know anything else.\u201d It is difficult to over-emphasise the cultural importance of cider to Shepton Mallet. The bookshelves in the tourist information are packed with tomes on cider, its display case with cider mugs. Almost everyone seems to have a relative or friend who has worked at the mill, one of the biggest cider producing plants in the world. Susan Liby was taking a walk along the river Sheppey, which runs past the mill, with her daughter Gwen and grandson Herbie. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster for the town,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s built on cider. Even the river smells of cider when they\u2019re pressing the apples.\u201d On C&amp;C\u2019s website much is made of the importance of Shepton Mallet\u2019s particular conditions. \u201cHere in the town of Shepton Mallet, high in the Mendips, an ancient borehole provided a natural source of water \u2013 perfect for the milling and blending of a most refreshing and distinctive Somerset cider,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd now, as then, at Shepton Mallet cider mill, making cider isn\u2019t just our passion \u2013 it\u2019s a way of life. Cider is our heritage and our legacy. The glories of our past and our dreams for the future. It flows through our mill and runs through our veins.\u201d The statement on the decision to cease production at Shepton is more prosaic. It says the \u201ctrading environment in the UK has been intensely competitive over recent years\u201d and claims \u201cconsolidation\u201d of production at the Clonmel site is the \u201conly viable option\u201d. Ironically, it is cider\u2019s growing popularity across the UK that means that things have got tougher for C&amp;C, which took over the mill and its brands in 2009. It has found itself squeezed between giants such as Stella and Carlsberg, which have invested eagerly in the cider market, and artisans lovingly crafting very local drinks. C&amp;C said in three years its profits in the UK had dropped from \u20ac30m (\u00a322.9m) to \u20ac10m. And another famous drinks brand may be affected by the changes in Shepton. Babycham, which is made from pears, was invented in the town in the 1950s and is produced at the mill \u2013 a giant Babycham fawn stands guard at the site. It is now owned by the Australian drinks giant Accolade Wines, which has not yet said what impact C&amp;C\u2019s announcement may have. Alan Stone, whose books on cider are to be found at the tourist information centre, said he feared famous names such as Blackthorn could be lost forever. \u201cThis is what happens when you get corporate entities with no local tradition taking over local businesses,\u201d he said. Master cider maker Bob Chaplin, who worked at the Shepton Mallet mill for more than 40 years and still lends his name to the Chaplin and Cork craft range, said it was a huge blow. \u201cIt seems that shareholders come above everything else. So much history, knowledge will be lost. It is a very sad time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing up for the day. Have a great weekend, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Stock markets have fallen sharply following poor US retail sales and industrial production data which point to slower economic growth at the end of 2015. Markets were already spooked by the continued slump in oil prices. On Wall Street, the Dow shed more than 400 points, a drop of 2.3%, and the Nasdaq is nearly 120 points off, a 2.7% decline. The FTSE 100 index is down 2.1%, France\u2019s CAC is off 2.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax has lost nearly 3%. Oil prices have hit fresh 12-year lows. Brent crude has been below $30 a barrel for most of the day, and was down nearly 5% at one stage. Some currency investors are betting against sterling in the derivatives markets on the assumption that a \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum will be held this summer. Reuters is reporting that options market pricing shows a jump in the cost of hedging against volatility between six and nine months from now. Another bad day on the markets. The FTSE 100 index is now trading 1.9% lower, a fall of more than 115 points to 5804.32. The Dax in Frankfurt has tumbled 2.8% while the CAC in Paris has lost 2.4%. Wall Street has opened sharply lower: the Dow lost more than 350 points, a 2.1% fall, in the first few minutes of trading. The Nasdaq is down 2.6%. The US industrial production data are also bad. Output fell for the third month in a row, by 0.4% in December, after a downwardly revised 0.9% decline in November. Production was held back by a strong dollar and cutbacks made by energy firms in the wake of plunging oil prices. Taken together with the worse-than-expected retail sales figures, they paint a worse economic picture in the last three months of 2015. Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics, said the retail sales figures point to fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1% annualised. All things considered, it doesn\u2019t appear that the record warm temperatures in December or the latest downward leg in gasoline prices are boosting spending in any meaningful way. We now estimate that real consumption growth was a disappointing 1.5% to 2% annualized in the fourth quarter, with overall GDP growth at an even weaker 1%.\u201d Neil Saunders, who heads up retail consultants Conlumino, said retail sales were held back by discounting and a lacklustre performance of many key holiday categories. Retailers had to work hard to persuade consumers to spend money. There are a number of explanations for the December pure retail number not being higher. The first of these is that the comparative from last year was fairly tough... A relatively weak product line up in electricals failed to capture consumer interest, resulting in a sales decline of around 3.5% in December; and although sales picked up the latter end of the month, clothing also put in a lackluster performance thanks to warmer than average weather. The third and final factor is discounting, which was more widespread and deeper this year than last: while this probably helped to stimulate some spending activity, it did not result in huge volume uplifts; as such, the net effect was to dampen overall sales growth.\u201d He sums up 2015 thus: Retail is now best described as being in a state of respectable but constrained growth. Despite consumer finances improving and despite consumers having more money to spend this is not consistently finding its way into cash registers. Retailers are having to work increasingly hard to persuade consumers to part with their cash.\u201d US retail sales for December were disappointing, said ING economist Rob Carnell, who found the figures somewhat puzzling. There is no single explanation for the weakness. Warmer than usual weather may heve reduced spending on seasonal clothing, but doesn\u2019t explain why auto sales were so much at odds with other auto sales data which are very strong. Falling electronics sales are also hard to explain, as is food, miscellaneous sales, and general merchandise.\u201d Factory gate prices also fell in December, by 0.2%, reflecting sharp drops in energy costs, according to the US Labor Department. This could dampen expectations that inflation will rise towards the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Over 2015 as a whole, producer prices fell 1%, the weakest reading since the series started in 2010. US retail sales slipped 0.1% in December, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change. Unusually warm weather meant retailers struggled to shift winter clothes, and cheaper gasoline dragged down sales at service stations. The November retail sales figure was revised higher to 0.4%, the US Commerce Department said. More worryingly, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services (which can be volatile), fell 0.3% last month, following a 0.5% rise in November. Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Howard Davies has put the probability of Britain exiting the European Union at 35% in an interview with Bloomberg Television. This probability assessment is based on a review of all the polls and also reflects what RBS economists think, Davies said. You cannot be sure how a referendum like this can go, the polls currently will tell you that there\u2019s a small majority in favour of remaining, but it\u2019s a very volatile environment. And what the polls also will tell you is that the thing people most worry about is immigration in some form, and of course if you had a referendum at a time when immigration was in the news, when the evening bulletins were full of boats across the Atlantic, or there was some great terrorist attack attributed to migrants, this could affect public opinion a lot. So I think there will be all kinds that will play into that decision when it comes which will not be fully rational based on an analysis of the impact on the City of London.\u201d On China\u2019s economic slowdown, he said: We\u2019re adjusting to that changed role of the Chinese economy, or changed growth rate, and of course the peripheral economies around China which will be affected in the same kind of way.\u201d Here are the key points of the interview: Brexit: \u201c35% probability\u201d His pessimism about UK / European investment banking Downsizing of RBS investment bank is \u201cgoing well\u201d Banks are more constrained in bets they can take There\u2019s an adjustment to Chinese growth There are \u201cfault lines\u201d in world economy Davies also talked about his lunch with David Bowie, who died on Sunday, and Iggy Pop in east Berlin in the 1970s: [Bowie] was worried about travelling around east Berlin as he was, and so he approached the British authorities. And as it happened, a friend of mine was in the British Embassy in east Berlin, and I was staying there for the weekend. And we escorted him around in a British diplomatic car and had lunch in the Bertolt Brecht restaurant.\u201d The Institute of Directors has sent us their response to the news that two former bosses of the Co-operative Bank, including its ex-CEO, have been banned from holding senior positions in the City. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said there was \u201c clearly also a failure on the part of the whole board\u201d. This is further proof that the leadership of the Co-operative Bank in the run up to its spectacular failure was woefully lacking in the skills, knowledge, and decision-making needed for a major financial institution. It is stark reminder that even brands which carry a positive public reputation can have it snatched away from them if their corporate governance isn\u2019t up to scratch. Non-executive directors are there to constructively challenge executives on their actions. Where they do not, as at the Co-op, it can be to the great detriment of the organisation\u2019s employees and customers. The Co-op traded on its reputation as an ethical and reliable bank, but while senior executives and the board may have believed their own hype, they manifestly failed to embody these principles, with devastating results.\u201d The IoD believes training for non-executives, including trustees of charities and third sector organisations, is vital for good governance and holding executives to account. It is launching a new course for charity trustees on May. Russia has poured cold water on the idea of co-ordinated oil output cuts with Opec, the oil cartel, to prop up plunging oil prices. Brent crude is holding below the $30 a barrel mark on Friday, down 4% on the day. A global oil glut has pushed prices more than 70% lower over the past 18 months. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said it is unlikely that such cuts would be agreed, adding that they would \u201cnot be efficient\u201d in any case. The RIA news agency quoted Novak as saying in an interview with RBC TV: From our point of view, it is unlikely that all the countries within OPEC can agree on production cuts, let alone those countries which are not in the Opec coalition. Such consultations have been underway for the past year and a half since oil prices started to fall in mid-2014. [But] we see that in 2015 countries like Saudi Arabia in Opec have increased total production by 1.5m barrels per day.\u201d Last month\u2019s Opec meeting ended without an agreement on how to shore up oil prices and some members of the cartel urged Russia to reduce its own output. In the past, Russia has argued that its harsh climate makes it hard to restart production once wells have been closed. We said earlier that the Shanghai Composite index had entered bear market territory, joining the rest of China. It\u2019s worth noting that the CSI 300 index, which comprises the top 300 stocks of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, has been there for some time. The Bank of England has banned the former boss of the Co-operative Bank, Barry Tootell, from holding a senior banking job. The lender nearly collapsed under the weight of its debts. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority also banned Keith Alderson, a former managing director of the Co-op Bank\u2019s corporate and business banking division. Both men also received fines. It is the first time the chief executive of a bank has been banned over their role during the financial crisis. PRA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: This action makes clear that there are serious consequences for senior individuals who fall short of the PRA\u2019s expectations. The new Senior Managers Regime, which will be introduced in March, will further ensure that senior managers are held duly responsible for their actions.\u201d Shares are still tumbling, with the FTSE 100 index in London down 72.24 points, or 1.2%, at 5845.99. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.9% while France\u2019s CAC is 1.2% lower. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has this reassuring message. Here in the UK, the energy regulator has accused the big six energy firms of overcharging customers. They haven\u2019t cut their retail prices despite plunging wholesale prices on international markets. The Guardian\u2019s energy editor Terry Macalister writes: The big six energy companies including SSE, npower and E.ON have made no recent announcements about cutting retail prices although British Gas did reduce its tariff by 5% last August. \u201cI think they are overcharging in many cases,\u201d the head of Ofgem Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. There should be bigger cuts in retail energy bills, he added. This list of the EU\u2019s main trading partners published by Eurostat shows the rising importance of the US, while there is less trade with Russia (unsurprisingly). Exports to the US grew 20% in the first 11 months of last year versus the same period in 2014, while sales to Russia slumped 29%. The healthier November trade data have raised hopes that a stronger trade performance boosted the economy as a whole and helped eurozone GDP growth improve in the fourth quarter of 2015, wrote Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. The eurozone\u2019s trade surplus with the rest of the world widened in November, according to preliminary figures from Eurostat. It rose to \u20ac23.6bn in November, from \u20ac20.1bn a year earlier. Exports of goods to the rest of the world rose 6% while imports grew 5%. The surplus on trade within the 19-nation currency bloc reached \u20ac145.7bn, from \u20ac138.5bn a year earlier. Brent crude has just fallen to a fresh 12-year low of $29.46 a barrel. On a lighter note, with global stock markets sliding and savings rates at record lows, the best investment at the moment could be a handbag. My colleague Sean Farrell writes: Not just any handbag, though. The accessory in question is the Hermes Birkin, the world\u2019s most coveted bag, which can cost up to \u00a3150,000 new. In the 35 years since the actor and singer Jane Birkin sat next to Hermes\u2019 boss Jean-Louis Dumas on a plane and complained about not being able to find a good leather weekend bag, the Birkin bag has beaten returns for gold and the benchmark US S&amp;P 500 index, according to the luxury bag retail site Baghunter. Read the full piece here. Back to oil, which is still below $30 a barrel. It hit $29.73 at one stage, the lowest since February 2004, and is now trading at $29.89 a barrel. The International Atomic Energy Agency could issue its report on Iran\u2019s compliance with an agreement to rein in its nuclear programme during a meeting in Vienna on Friday, whereupon western sanctions could be lifted and open the door to more oil supply from Iran. The country\u2019s oil exports are already on track to hit a nine-month high in January, at 1.1m barrels a day. Analysts at Commerzbank said: With sanctions on Iran likely to be lifted, more oil is flooding the markets. Although the additional supply had been imminent for some time, current sentiment ought to send prices further south.\u201d They cut their 2016 forecast for oil prices to $50 per barrel for Brent by the end of the year, down from a previous forecast of $63. Sterling has hit a 5 1/2 year low against the dollar again, as traders are growing doubtful over Britain\u2019s economic outlook and the timing of the first rate hike \u2013 which some don\u2019t expect until early next year \u2013 and fears over \u201cBrexit\u201d intensify. Prime minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but it may come as early as June this year. Volatility in markets is likely to increase in the run-up to the poll. The pound slipped 0.5% to $1.4337 earlier, its weakest level since May 2016. It has lost more than 6% in the past six months. It also lost ground against the euro. The euro rose 0.7% to 75p, not far off a one-year high of 76.06p it hit on Thursday. The Bank of England said that British banks saw a notable rise in demand for personal loans and other unsecured credit in late 2015, and this is expected to continue into this year. The Bank\u2019s credit conditions survey said banks were awarding more unsecured lending to households as lenders\u2019 appetite for risk grew. The increase in unsecured credit availability appeared particularly apparent in other unsecured lending, such as personal loans, where credit scoring criteria were reported to have loosened.\u201d The latest data show that net unsecured consumer credit climbed to \u00a31.5bn in November from \u00a31.2bn in October, taking it to its highest level since February 2008. It was the ninth month running that unsecured consumer credit had been over \u00a31bn. Construction output fell 0.5% in Britain in November from October as firms took on fewer new work, according to official figures out just now. Production was down 1.1% on a year ago. Greece\u2019s European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens\u2019 reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away. Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini: We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded.\u201d Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018. He said: If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored.\u201d Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review. Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece\u2019s first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout. She told Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key. It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece\u2019s economic position is improving.\u201d The IMF has not provided any aid to Athens since August 2014 under a previous programme that is due to expire next March. Brent crude has fallen below $30 a barrel again, losing one dollar to $29.88 a barrel, a 3.2% drop. Independent City analyst Nick Bubb says about Bonmarch\u00e9, which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance on Friday: Back on Dec 16th, poor old Bonmarch\u00e9 was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: \u201cIn the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels\u201d (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures.\u201d The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%. After Thursday\u2019s flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here\u2019s a round-up of the main corporate news. The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT\u2019s contentious \u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell. You can read more here. The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services. It said there was little overlap between BT\u2019s mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE\u2019s mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT\u2019s network. UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to \u00a3231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy. H&amp;M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%. Bonmarch\u00e9, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December. Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a \u201cterrible year for global stock markets\u201d. According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&amp;P companies across the pond where we\u2019re seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won\u2019t we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014.\u201d European stock markets are also in the red, half an hour after the open. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.08% at 5913.19 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.4% at 9757.21 France\u2019s CAC down 0.6% at 4287.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.6% at 8732.50 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1% at 19,592.78 This means that the Shanghai Composite index, which recorded its lowest close since December 2014, is now in a bear market. It has lost more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high. The tech-focused Shenzhen Composite, which finished 3.4% lower at 1,796.1, already entered a bear market a week ago, and is now down 24.5% from its recent 22 December high. Asian stock markets finished in the red. The Shanghai Composite lost 3.5% to 2902.22 The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index shed 3.2% to 3118.73 Japan\u2019s Nikkei slipped 0.5% to 17,147.11 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 1.2% to 19,587.58 On the agenda today: UK construction figures for November and the Bank of England\u2019s credit conditions survey, both out at 9:30 GMT. Eurozone trade figures for November at 10 GMT; US retail sales for December at 13.30 GMT and US industrial production for December at 14.15 GMT. European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen\u2019s market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll. VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association in Brussels. The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW\u2019s 6.2% increase. Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details. The ACEA said all major car markets had a strong finish to 2015. Spain (+20.7%), Italy (+18.7%) and France (+12.5%) posted double-digit percentage gains during the month, followed by the UK (+8.4%) and Germany (+7.7%), which also performed better than in December 2014. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brent crude is continuing its slide, trading down 1.85% at $30.31 a barrel at the minute. New York Light crude is down even more, losing 3% to $30.27 a barrel. The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer. Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices. Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing\u2019s efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy. Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said: The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy.\u201d",

The first of these is that the comparative from last year was fairly tough... </p> <p>A relatively weak product line up in electricals failed to capture consumer interest, resulting in a sales decline of around 3.5% in December; and although sales picked up the latter end of the month, clothing also put in a lackluster performance thanks to warmer than average weather. </p> <p>The third and final factor is discounting, which was more widespread and deeper this year than last: while this probably helped to stimulate some spending activity, it did not result in huge volume uplifts; as such, the net effect was to dampen overall sales growth.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He sums up 2015 thus:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Retail is now best described as being in a state of respectable but constrained growth. Despite consumer finances improving and despite consumers having more money to spend this is not consistently finding its way into cash registers.

Construction output fell 0.5% on a monthly basis in November, according to the Office for National Statistics, against expectations for a rise of 0.5% in a Reuters poll of economists. In his autumn statement in November, George Osborne, the chancellor, welcomed a revised forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility that predicted an acceleration in the UK\u2019s growth rate. But the weak construction figures follow a contraction across the manufacturing industry and a slowdown in the services sector that could push GDP growth in the last quarter of 2015 to 0.4%, lower than previously estimated. The ONS said bad weather may have weighed on the construction industry, which accounts for around 6% of economic activity in Britain. Heavy rain and flooding hit many areas of the UK during November, forcing builders to down tools. Infrastructure work was the worst affected, falling 4.3%, its biggest monthly drop since June 2014. Housebuilding growth slowed to 0.9% from 1.9% in the previous month, despite a push by the government to boost the number of homes built to meet growing demand. The ONS said construction output would need to increase by 2.6% month-on-month in December to avoid a fall for the fourth quarter as a whole. It was a different picture in the first half of last year when official figures indicated that the sector was booming, with the number of cranes looming over London and Manchester supporting a rosy outlook. However, a slump in the summer and autumn continued into the winter months and contributed to 1.1% fall in annual output, the biggest 12-month drop since May 2013.",

The closure of the store in Bradford\u2019s Westgate with the loss of more than 80 jobs is a blow for the city which is attempting to rebuild itself after several years of difficulties. Morrisons has also begun consultation with staff about the closure of stores in Wigan, Boston in Lincolnshire, Stowmarket in Suffolk, Braintree in Essex, Tunbridge Wells in Kent, and Hounslow, west London. The stores are expected to close over the next few months. Nearly 700 jobs are at risk as a result of the closures which were announced despite Morrisons achieving a surprise increase in sales over Christmas. David Potts, the chief executive, said the supermarkets were unprofitable and he could not find a way to sufficiently improve performance. The latest closures follow those of 21 supermarkets last year and the sale of Morrisons\u2019 140 convenience stores, known as M Local. The Bradford Westgate store was opened in 1969, making it one of Morrisons earliest outlets. The company previously considered closing the store six years ago but it was given a reprieve. Morrisons said: \u201cRegrettably we cannot see any improvement in the viability of the Westgate store and are proposing its closure. Many people will know that we have considered closing the store before and have instead decided to carry on trading which is in part down to the hard work of our colleagues.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With stock markets tumbling and savings rates at record lows, the best option for long-term investors could be to buy a handbag. Not just any handbag, though. The accessory in question is the Hermes Birkin, the world\u2019s most coveted bag, which can cost up to \u00a3150,000 new. In the 35 years since the actor and singer Jane Birkin sat next to Hermes\u2019 boss Jean-Louis Dumas on a plane and complained about not being able to find a good leather weekend bag, the Birkin bag has beaten returns for gold and the benchmark US S&amp;P 500 index, according to the luxury bag retail site Baghunter. The value of Birkin bags increased every year from 1980 to 2005, averaging a 14.2% rise each year, including inflation, Baghunter calculated. In the same time, the average return on gold was -1.5% and the S&amp;P 500\u2019s was 8.7% a year, the site said. The figures assume that an investor bought assets and held them instead of moving in and out of the market. The peak annual return for the S&amp;P 500 was 37.2% in 1999 \u2013 the index\u2019s worst year was 2008 when it lost 36.6%. The Birkin bag\u2019s worst year yielded a return of 2.1%, Baghunter said.

    "webTitle": "Gold is the bright spot in commodities rout but 2016 forecasts are divided", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gold prices started 2016 with a glimmer, rising to two-month highs in the wake of the Chinese stock market rout and the ripple effects it caused in European and US markets. After touching an all-time nominal high of more than $1,900 an ounce in 2011, gold values have generally declined. Since 2013, the yellow metal posted annual losses. Investor interest soured amid the commodity rout and a stronger US dollar, but so far in 2016, gold has resumed its traditional role as a safe haven in times of financial turmoil. Its role as a de facto insurance policy allowed gold to buck the commodity sell-off as the new year dawns \u2013 industrial commodities like crude oil and copper were pressured hard by the worries over China, which is the biggest commodity consumer. As such, the metal\u2019s outperformance of almost every other investment this year has turned some heads. Last week gold prices rose over $1,100 an ounce in New York for the first time since November at the height of Chinese concerns, although they have pulled back to about $1,077 as concerns abate for now. But there\u2019s some discussion about whether its shining start is the beginning of a rebound or just a temporary bounce. Those who see a modestly higher path for gold said US dollar pressure may wane in the coming months, while others say the general deflationary commodity environment is negative for gold prices. The impact of further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes is also debated, as some suggest that since the Fed has finally acted, the market can focus on other factors. However, others say even modestly higher interest rates make gold undesirable versus other safe investment choices like US Treasuries, since the metal has no yield. James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC, says he is \u201cmoderately bullish\u201d on gold, with a 2016 average price forecast of $1,205. In addition to the safe-haven buying, gold offers non-US buyers a currency play. \u201cIt\u2019s one way to hedge yourself against a weaker domestic currency since it reflects a dollar value,\u201d he said. He was also impressed that gold did not sell off sharply after a stronger-than-expected US jobs figure and has held up despite oil\u2019s drop to 12-year lows. His higher 2016 price forecast is based on the idea that the US dollar will soften and emerging market demand will improve later this year. Kevin Grady, owner of Phoenix Futures and Options, said the rebound in gold inspired some light investor interest again in the futures market. \u201cWhen the stock market would have its big down days, in gold we would start to see some buying come in. It seems as if people are picking at it,\u201d he said. Purchases of gold-backed exchange-traded funds also rose. The largest of these ETFs, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), witnessed nearly a 10 metric-ton increase from 31 December to 11 January, to 651.68 tons. The Chinese lunar new year may also spur gold-buying in Asia which could support prices, too. The question is: will investors stay? Despite the gains, many gold-market watchers say the rally is transitory because of the lack of inflation. Gold feeds on inflation, and without its favorite food, the metal may be on a diet for now. Barclays still pegs its 2016 average price at $1,054 an ounce, just off the 2015 low of $1,050. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for US Bank Wealth Management, said the deflationary risks in Europe and the low oil and gasoline prices in the US make it hard to see any inflation. Plus, the January jobs data gives the Fed room to raise rates. He sees gold prices weaker through mid-2016. He said he would change his mind if \u201cthe market starts to believe the central banks, and inflation expectations \u2013 rather than headline inflation itself \u2013 start to tick up. That will start to change our view on gold to more neutral.\u201d Rohit Savant, director of research with commodities consultancy CPM Group, said gold prices could rise a touch from here. His average 2016 gold price is $1,140, saying with the Fed finally on the path of raising rates, gold no longer has that specter hanging overhead. The problem for gold is there is no \u201cnew\u201d information to push prices either way, leaving it stuck between the negative and positive factors long worked into prices, he said. Despite gold moving to two-month highs, it\u2019s not likely to be the sexy investment of a few years ago. Grady said he \u201ccan\u2019t get excited about gold\u201d until it rises above $1,205 because that was an area of heavy trading activity when prices were falling, and will probably be difficult for the market to rise above. \u201cThose are key numbers. The problem is those numbers are $100 away,\u201d he said.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "How Australian households became the most indebted in the world", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The results are in: Australian households have more debt compared to the size of the country\u2019s economy than any other in the world. Research by the Federal Reserve has shown the consolidated household debt to GDP ratio increased the most for Australia between 1960 and 2010 out of a select group of OECD nations. Australia\u2019s household sector has accumulated massive unconsolidated debt compared with other countries. As of the third quarter of 2015, it now has the world\u2019s most indebted household sector relative to GDP, according to LF Economics\u2019 analysis of national statistics. Denmark long held this unholy accomplishment, but has been slowly deleveraging over the last several years as its housing bubble peaked and burst during the GFC. The latest debt-financed boom in Sydney and Melbourne has resulted in Australia now overtaking Denmark, a comparison of official figures from Australia and Denmark has shown. Australia has around $2 trillion in unconsolidated household debt relative to $1.6 trillion in GDP. Australia\u2019s ratio is 123.08%, while Denmark\u2019s fell slightly to 122.99% in the third quarter of 2015, a marginal difference of 9 basis points. Although Denmark holds the record in terms of peak debt of 140.14% in the last quarter of 2009, as Australia continues to leverage and Denmark deleverages the current gap between the two will widen. Apart from Switzerland (which alongside Denmark has a negative interest rate), no other country is close in terms of having such extreme household sector debts. The UK ratio is 85.9% while in the US it is 79.1%. Due to Switzerland\u2019s opaque financial accounts, it is impossible to calculate a figure for this quarter. Its ratio for the second quarter of 2015 is 121.3%, and household debt is rising very slowly, so it would take an extraordinary increase over the quarter to potentially beat Australia. The final confirmation of the trend is expected when the Bank of International Settlements publishes its analysis of private credit statistics from the third quarter. Australian property investors and homeowners are burdened with massive mortgages, especially new and marginal entrants. Unlike winning a gold medal at the Olympics, having the world\u2019s most indebted household sector is not an achievement the nation should be proud of. This is where Australia\u2019s real debt and deficit problem lies, not in the public sector. Over the last two decades, Australia has been beset by rampant housing price inflation. Since 1996, prices have outpaced fundamentals such as inflation, incomes, construction costs, rents and GDP, making it difficult for potential first home buyers to enter the market while lower income households and marginal groups struggle to afford decent shelter. Between 1996 and 2015, housing prices (adjusted for inflation and quality) have boomed by 141%, without a large and obvious downturn. This surge has led to a heated debate over whether this constitutes an asset bubble. Unfortunately, the Australian housing market shares similarities with countries afflicted by such bubbles: the United States, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland. Government, the FIRE sector (finance, insurance and real estate) and the mainstream economics profession deny the existence of a real estate bubble, but Australia\u2019s economic history demonstrates they occur repeatedly, with all signs pointing to one today. Contrary to the analyses of the vested interests, the data clearly establishes Australia is in the midst of the largest housing bubble on record. Government is caught between a rock and a hard place, as implementing needed reforms will likely burst the bubble, causing severe financial and economic problems as residential land prices decline. The FIRE sector, including the public caught in the fallout, will surely blame government for the bust and deflect attention away from the gargantuan amount of debt pumped out by lenders. One of the faults of real estate analysis is the failure to distinctly define an asset bubble, so debate on the matter is kept necessarily vague. Only a couple of housing market metrics is needed to identify a bubble, and are now considered commonplace: nominal price to inflation, price to income and price to rent. On all three, Australia is both historically and internationally at or near the top. Since the advent of the GFC, it has become commonly accepted that the global real estate booms originated from rapidly expanding bank credit or private mortgage debt. It is not merely the growth of mortgage debt (the first derivative) but the acceleration (the second derivative), also known as the change in the rate of growth. Nevertheless, the simple growth of mortgage debt provides a strong indicator for housing price growth. The future for investors and new homeowners is not good. Subdued capital price growth in the secondary capital cities, rental price growth at record lows, significant dwelling construction and a falling population growth rate leading to further oversupply all spell danger. The problems are compounded by the Reserve bank having little room for interest rate cuts, by weak macroprudential controls, minimal savings, low household income growth and anaemic GDP growth. Captured by neoliberal ideology and the FIRE sector, government has no interest in stopping this immensely profitable yet dangerous gravy train, having enriched the already wealthy beyond avarice through privatisation of unearned economic rents rather than productive activity.
