The professor doesn't like the requirement on companies to give financial updates every quarter. He calls the regime a \"tyranny.\" He's right. There's no need for a blizzard of statistics every three months. Once upon a time, everybody knew not to trust a company that displayed its real-time share price on an electronic board in the lobby of its corporate HQ. It was a tell-tale sign that the executives were spending too much time watching the market's short-term assessment of the company's worth; that time would be better spent trying to create some long-term value. Quarterly reporting, however, has encouraged scoreboard-watching, both by corporate executives and fund managers, who generally also have to give three-monthly updates on their own performance. There's an interesting paragraph in Kay's report in which he reveals the view of Sir Terry Leahy. The former boss of Tesco said the quality of engagement with City analysts and fund managers had declined during his time at the top - there was too much concentration on quarterly numbers and earnings guidance and too little on the strategic direction of a business. Tesco shareholders may look ruefully on those comments given recent troubles (did the supermarket chain strain too hard to keep up City expectations?) but Leahy's point seems unarguable: if everybody is obsessed by the next trading update, it's harder for owners and executives to talk about how to improve profits in five years' time. The argument in favour of quarterly reporting says shareholders are grown-ups, or should be, and thus are perfectly capable of judging for themselves what financial information counts as truly important. Well, yes, but it's the cultural effect on companies' decision-making that's the worry. It has become increasingly hard for managements to sell a story of long-term investment at the expense of short-pain in, say, cash flow. Share buy-backs rule; five-year investment projects don't. There are many other causes of short-termism. For example: absurd incentive plans for executives and fund managers; a tax system that encourages financial leverage; and high-frequency trading.

Sales by Vertolety Rossii, a Russian helicopter-maker, rose more than 135% following sales to the Russian military, and exports to Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Iraq.</p> <p>Lockheed Martin, an American company, heads Sipri's list of the top 100 arms and military service companies, with $35.7bn (\u00a322.4bn) worth of arms sales in 2010, followed by Britain's BAE Systems ($32.8bn/\u00a320.6bn), and US firms Boeing ($31.3bn/\u00a319.6bn) and Northrop Grumman ($28.5bn/\u00a317.9bn).

The withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan after 2014 could lead to fewer orders by US and UK companies, which are also facing defence cuts.</p> <p>BAE, Europe's biggest arms company and Britain's largest manufacturing employer, warned last month of \"little sales growth\" this year with US and UK military spending cutbacks leading to a 14% fall in 2011 revenues.</p> <p>The company reported a fall in sales to \u00a319.2bn, as a result of lower demand for US army vehicles and a \u00a3500m reduction in turnover from the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Pointing to BAE's earnings in the UK and the US, chief executive Ian King said: \"Affordability has become the priority for our customers.\"</p>",

Sipri's arms industry expert, Susan Jackson, said: \"The data for 2010 demonstrates, once again, the major players' ability to continue selling arms and military services despite the financial crises currently affecting other industries.\" The report highlighted Oshkosh, a US company, which recorded an 87% sales increase after winning the contract for the US mine-resistant ambush-protected all-terrain vehicle. Sales by Vertolety Rossii, a Russian helicopter-maker, rose more than 135% following sales to the Russian military, and exports to Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Iraq. Lockheed Martin, an American company, heads Sipri's list of the top 100 arms and military service companies, with $35.7bn (\u00a322.4bn) worth of arms sales in 2010, followed by Britain's BAE Systems ($32.8bn/\u00a320.6bn), and US firms Boeing ($31.3bn/\u00a319.6bn) and Northrop Grumman ($28.5bn/\u00a317.9bn). Other European companies in the top eleven include the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, Italy's Finmeccanica, and France's Thales. Though the figures show arms sales have been thriving despite global economic troubles, the next few years do not look so profitable for weapons makers, at least those who depend on the US and European markets. The withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan after 2014 could lead to fewer orders by US and UK companies, which are also facing defence cuts. BAE, Europe's biggest arms company and Britain's largest manufacturing employer, warned last month of \"little sales growth\" this year with US and UK military spending cutbacks leading to a 14% fall in 2011 revenues. The company reported a fall in sales to \u00a319.2bn, as a result of lower demand for US army vehicles and a \u00a3500m reduction in turnover from the Ministry of Defence. Pointing to BAE's earnings in the UK and the US, chief executive Ian King said: \"Affordability has become the priority for our customers.\"",

As central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic played down expectations that they were poised to unleash a fresh round of money creation, Peter Sands, the chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, warned it was \"going to take time for the rich West to sort itself out\". But Sands's main concern was that support operations by western central banks, which have seen trillions of dollars pumped into the financial system through so-called quantitative easing, could set the scene for more trouble in the years ahead.

US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who has authorised $2.3 trillion worth of bond buying to prop up the system, speaking in Washington on Wednesday, played down hopes that he will support further QE after official figures showed the world's largest economy expanding faster than first thought at the end of 2011. In its latest estimate of fourth quarter growth, the US Commerce Department said GDP expanded at an annual pace of 3% \u2013 up from its last estimate of 2.8%. In one of his twice-yearly so-called Humphrey Hawkins testimonies to Congress, Bernanke made clear he and his fellow Fed governors were still weighing up the strength of the US economy. \"In light of somewhat different signals received recently from the labour market than from indicators of final demand and production ... it will be especially important evaluate incoming information to assess the underlying pace of the economic recovery,\" he said.

The ECB's long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), which offers banks three-year loans at an interest rate of 1%, was the key crisis measure introduced by its governor Mario Draghi, last year to stave off the risk of a full-blown eurozone credit crunch. The Frankfurt-based lender said on Wednesday, a day after banks were invited to bid for the loans, that 800 financial institutions had borrowed a total of \u20ac529.53bn, in line with market forecasts, taking the total borrowed under the LTRO to more than \u20ac1trn. Michel Martinez, a eurozone economist at SocGen, described it as a \"goldilocks allocation\" \u2013 neither too large nor too small to alarm financial markets. \"The amount allocated at the ECB's second three-year LTRO seems to strike a good balance between a very large number that may have been seen as a sign of weakness of the banking sector and a small number that would have been seen as not making much difference to risk assets,\" he said. Analysts also said the large number of borrowers suggested smaller banks had been able to tap the cheap loans, as well as the large institutions that were seen as the main beneficiaries of the previous round of funding. But some banks, including Standard Chartered and ING, were keen to distance themselves from the operation, stressing that they had not taken any of the cash.

The measure was widely seen as critical to restoring calm to financial markets \u2013 and mending the finances of ailing European banks. Italian and Spanish lenders used the funds to buy their governments' bonds, helping bring yields down to more manageable levels. However, some economists have echoed Sands's concerns by warning that the LTRO is storing up huge problems for the future if the eurozone banks have failed to recover strongly enough by the end of the three-year period to wean themselves off public support. Investors had warned that a higher-than-expected take-up of the LTRO could signal distress among eurozone banks. Christel Aranda-Hassel, economist at Credit Suisse, said the ECB was likely to hold fire for the time being from offering a fresh boost to the economy \u2014 by resuming interest rate cuts, for example. \"We expect the ECB to take a back seat now and assess the effect of its liquidity injection.\"",

After all it was the worst performing share in the FTSE 100 last year and is well below its 2010 flotation price of 420p. It lost further ground since January when India's supreme court ruled against a scheme whereby the company has been able to defer $1.24bn - so far - in sales tax.</p> <p>But its shares ended Wednesday as the biggest faller in the leading index as the takeover speculation faded as quickly as it had come, and Credit Suisse analysts cut their recommendation from outperform to neutral. The bank also slashed its target price - perhaps belatedly - from 435p to 155p, saying:</p> <blockquote> Essar [is] down 37% year to date mainly on a negative Indian Supreme Court ruling on its deferred sales tax benefits.

      "bodyText": "Essar Energy, the Indian power group, has been a volatile stock in recent days after its earnings missed expectations on Monday. It was lifted the following day by vague talk that the controlling Ruia family might take the company private. After all it was the worst performing share in the FTSE 100 last year and is well below its 2010 flotation price of 420p. It lost further ground since January when India's supreme court ruled against a scheme whereby the company has been able to defer $1.24bn - so far - in sales tax. But its shares ended Wednesday as the biggest faller in the leading index as the takeover speculation faded as quickly as it had come, and Credit Suisse analysts cut their recommendation from outperform to neutral. The bank also slashed its target price - perhaps belatedly - from 435p to 155p, saying: Essar [is] down 37% year to date mainly on a negative Indian Supreme Court ruling on its deferred sales tax benefits. [It] still offers a strong growth and long-term cash generation profile, but we need more clarity on near-term financing and progress on negotiations with the state government and lenders. Essar closed 8.5p lower at 104.9p. The company is likely to lose its place in the leading index next week, along with Cairn Energy and Hargreaves Lansdowne. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 56.40 points lower at 5871.51, its lowest point of the day. Early support when the European Central Bank announced its next round of \u20ac530bn cheap loans ran out of steam when US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke seemed to hint in a testimony to Congress that he might be cooling on further quantitative easing. Mining shares were among the main fallers as gold slumped in the wake of a rise in the dollar following Bernanke's comments. Vedanta Resources lost 62p to \u00a314.40 while Rio Tinto - which also went ex-dividend - lost 146.5p to \u00a335.84. Xstrata lost 21.5p to \u00a312 despite analysts at HSBC suggesting Glencore, down 6.35p to 432p, might improve the terms of its merger proposal from 2.8 Glencore shares to perhaps 3.1. Pumps maker Weir fell 99p to \u00a321.06 following its figures, but ITV headed in the other direction after its results pleased investors, climbing 5.45p to 85.95p. Topping the FTSE 250 risers was International Personal Finance, up 23.5p at 247.7p after the emerging markets lender reported record full year profits. Kesa Electricals, the retailer where activist investor Knight Vinke has been edging up its stake, dipped 1.4p to 74.55p despite talk of possible bid interest at 110p a share. Thomas Cook added 5.25p to 28.25p on vague suggestions rival TUI could pounce, but speculators were wary of the tale. Finally Energetix, the alternative energy group, fell 7% to 26p after it announced director Alan Aubrey had resigned and unveiled a placing at 25p a share to raise \u00a34.6m.",

      "bodyText": "If confirmation were needed of the obstacles facing young people looking for work, it comes in Wednesday's official figures showing a dramatic drop in the youth employment rate. The Office for National Statistics has helped lay out the scale of the youth unemployment problem for ministers struggling to defend their latest labour market initiatives by reporting that the employment rate for young people has declined much faster than for older workers in recent years. It's a change from the pattern seen between 1992 and 2004 when young people not in full-time education had an employment rate similar to those aged 25 to 64. In fact, in January-March 2004, there was a gap of just 0.2 percentage points between the employment rate of 25-to-64-year-olds (75.5%) and that of 16-to-24-year-olds not in full-time education (75.3%). Fast-forward to October-December 2011 and the rate for the older age group was little different, at 74.9%. But the rate for the younger group not in full-time education had slumped to 66%. In other words, in eight years the employment rate gap between young and older people leapt to 8.9 percentage points from just 0.2 percentage points. With the gap so big, labour market experts are warning that any economic recovery will still leave younger people at a disadvantage. It is important to note that the decline in youth employment rates started long before the recession. As thinktank the Work Foundation points out, the drop began from 2004 \u2013 and although economic recovery should help improve youth employment rates to some extent there are deeper problems: namely, young people lacking the experience employers now seek and struggling to get that experience. Andrew Sissons, a researcher at the Work Foundation, says there is no single reason for the drop from 2004 onwards but that, in general, work has become more complicated and therefore experience has become more valued. For young people, that trend leaves them in a vicious cycle, locked out from the world of work. Sissons advocates more links for young people into the world of work: \"The really important thing is to be able to connect businesses with further education colleges and schools so young people have some chance of moving from the world of education to work. The really vital thing is being able to get that experience.\" The ONS statistics suggest that experience problem has hit young people much harder, as might be expected, he adds. \"Employment rates for young people began to fall sharply after 2004 even while overall employment continued to hold up, and the recession has made this trend far worse.\" What the recession and changes in workloads have done is made opportunities for experience much rarer. Sissons concludes: \"A swift economic recovery would help reduce youth unemployment but it is unlikely that young people will begin to catch up with older workers without a big improvement in our skills system and the way we connect young people to the world of work.\" Any organisations that feel they have solutions to the growing gap are being encouraged to get in touch with the Commons work and pensions committee, which this week launched an inquiry into whether the government's approach on youth unemployment is working.",

Profits for 2011 rose by 12% to \u00a3180m, despite a greatly reduced rail operation, after the group's disastrous involvement in the east coast mainline and subsequent loss of the Greater Anglia franchise. However, the group insisted it wanted to play a part in UK rail, even if future growth was not dependent on it \u2013 but only on terms that were reasonable. It is looking to bid for three rail franchises in the next two years. Chief executive Dean Finch said: \"In just two years National Express has moved from reporting losses to the record profits we have announced today. We carried more passengers than in 2010 and are now the best performing operator in many of our markets.\" Further austerity measures, fuel and train fare increases in 2012, are expected to continue to push passengers on to the cheaper modes of travel National Express provides. Coach passenger numbers were slightly up overall, and particularly in crisis-hit Spain. Austerity has also produced rapidly rising sales of its discount student coach cards in the UK, with 36% more being sold year on year. Revenues continued to grow in its US school bus operations. The group's Spanish coach operations were the biggest contributor to operating profits, at \u00a390.1m. Finch said: \"We've got real momentum in the business right now and significant opportunities to build on our successes.\" He said that a key focus will be continuing control of costs, largely driven by better procurement and vehicle management \u2013 an area in which he said the company had in years gone by been \"pretty slack\".",

The results are near enough in line with our expectations, and though we will tinker with our forecasts in due course, we see nothing in this of real concern.

Like other housebuilders the group has seen good momentum in current trade, but for the time being we maintain our 2012 forecasts.

However, while customer deposits remain high, competitor comments suggest the market has remained quiet in the third quarter Further, earnings upgrades have been a key driver for IG's shares price and over the next six to nine months, it faces the headwind of strong comparatives. We trim our estimates to reflect a more cautious outlook, reduce our target price to 500p from 530p, and downgrade our rating to neutral. <br> </blockquote> <p>Citi cut its earnings per share estimates for 2012, 2013 and 2014 by 1%, 4% and 4%, respectively.\uf06e</p>",

With its debt reduced from \u00a3655m to \u00a3117m, helped by the sale of its north American business, it plans to retore its final dividend with a payment of 0.38p a share. Mike Bessell at Investec reduced his recommendation from buy to hold, and said: Following the excitement of yesterday's Persimmon announcement, it was a relief to see no fireworks in today's announcement from Taylor Wimpey. The results are near enough in line with our expectations, and though we will tinker with our forecasts in due course, we see nothing in this of real concern. Albeit small, the return to paying a dividend is a positive signal. [But] we see the shares as having run far enough, having started 2012 at 37p. We retain our net asset value-based target price [of 52p] and downgrade to hold. Rachael Waring at Panmure Gordon had a similar view: Taylor Wimpey had reported preliminary results a little lower than our expectations. Like other housebuilders the group has seen good momentum in current trade, but for the time being we maintain our 2012 forecasts. With the stock racing past our target price in recent days our recommendation moves back to hold from buy. Still with the mid-caps, spread betting group IG is down 22.6p at 440.5p after Citigroup moved from buy to neutral: The scale of IG's technology platform combined with continued geographical expansion positions it well for medium-term growth. However, while customer deposits remain high, competitor comments suggest the market has remained quiet in the third quarter Further, earnings upgrades have been a key driver for IG's shares price and over the next six to nine months, it faces the headwind of strong comparatives. We trim our estimates to reflect a more cautious outlook, reduce our target price to 500p from 530p, and downgrade our rating to neutral. Citi cut its earnings per share estimates for 2012, 2013 and 2014 by 1%, 4% and 4%, respectively.\uf06e",
