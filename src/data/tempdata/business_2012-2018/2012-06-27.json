      "bodyText": "Germany has flatly ruled out any pooling of eurozone debt in response to the single currency crisis, seeming to set the scene for clashes at an EU summit that looks unlikely to take any big decisions to quickly stabilise the euro. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sharply criticised a seven-page blueprint drawn up by four senior EU leaders on opening the way to a eurozone political federation. She made it clear she would not yield to pressure to move towards the common issuance of eurozone debt in the form of eurobonds, to lower the cost of borrowing for vulnerable countries such as Spain and Italy. Merkel's tough stance appeared to open up the prospects of a clash with Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, who is trying to restructure Italy's creaking economy but is impotent in the face of the financial markets raising the price he pays to borrow. Italy was forced to offer a yield of 2.96% to sell six-month bills, up from 2.1% a month ago. Its benchmark 10-year yield was up slightly at 6.22% and faces an important test with an auction of \u20ac5.5bn (\u00a34.4bn) of five and 10-year bonds. There were also no signs of any concessions from Merkel towards President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who will use the summit to claim he has forced the EU or the eurozone to adopt policies shifting the emphasis from austerity and spending cuts to a growth and jobs agenda. The summit is likely to agree a \"growth pact,\" nominally dedicating \u20ac130bn to foster job creation and infrastructure projects. But the scheme is essentially an exercise in repackaging already agreed measures or re-directing already committed EU funds. Merkel told parliament in Berlin, before going off to Paris to see Hollande, that she would not allow \"Germany to be overstretched\" by bankrolling borrowing to save the euro. Unusually, she predicted \"controversial discussions\" at the two-day summit, signalling that she was ready for a row. \"I fear that at [the summit] there will again be far too much talk about all possible ideas for common liability and far too little about better controls and structural measures,\" she said. Eurobonds, eurobills, or a debt redemption fund \u2013 all ways of pooling eurozone debt liability \u2013 were illegal and counter-productive, Merkel said. On Tuesday, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council who chairs the summits, announced an ambitious plan to build a eurozone political union within a decade, entailing the surrender of national powers to Brussels. Merkel attacked the plan as again being too keen on pooling liability with not enough emphasis on fiscal discipline. Senior French officials said, by contrast, that Hollande was \"at ease\" with the blueprint, which was \"balanced.\" \"The Germans say it is a French report. The French say it is a German report,\" said a senior EU official involved in the summit preparations. \"The truth is it's somewhere in-between.\" EU and French officials agreed that the two-day summit is the most important in years, probably since the 1990s, but that it could end in a stalemate that rattles the markets and increases the pressure on the euro from Monday. There was talk in Brussels of coming up with short-term measures to relieve the market pressure on Spain and Italy. The summit is likely to take the first steps towards establishing an EU or eurozone banking union, with the aim of setting up common systems for winding up bad banks, recapitalising them, and standing behind savers' deposits under the overall authority of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Britain wants nothing to do with it and there are certain to be conflicts in the months ahead as the Cameron government seeks to quarantine the City from the new regime's remit. But the banking union proposal is hugely complex. The devil is in the detail. While many of the governments say they support it, they will be at odds over its scope and powers. A third of EU countries also look likely to press ahead with moves to launch a levy on financial transactions or Tobin tax. The tax is strongly supported by Hollande and by Austria. Merkel said that the Germans had signed up nine countries , the number required for so-called \"enhanced cooperation\" policies under the Lisbon Treaty. Critics say introducing the tax in only nine countries will distort the market and trigger an exodus of financial institutions to other places. Adherents say you have to start somewhere and more will join later. Britain is prepared to provide more than \u00a31bn to help recapitalise the European Investment bank to stimulate growth in the EU. The summit in Brussels will examine proposals to increase the \"paid-in capital\" of the EIB, which underwrites investment projects, by \u00a38bn. Britain has a 16% shareholding in the EIB which means it would provide \u00a31.28bn. The eurosceptic Open Europe thinktank questioned the move. Mats Persson, the director, said: \"In principle this could be a positive idea for Europe if investment is well targeted. But in practice it's not clear whether the additional EIB cash will actually do anything to stem the crisis, in particular since the ECB just flushed Europe with \u20ac1tn worth of credit without achieving a major boost to investment. Unfortunately this feels a bit like spending for the sake of spending \u2013 which is exactly what the coalition opposes at home.\" Treasury sources said Britain's contribution would amount to a contingent liability. This would affect Britain's debt but not the deficit. Sources said that strengthening the EIB would benefit the UK because many of its projects are in Britain. They said supporting the EIB, which underwrites risk, is consistent with the approach adopted by the government and the Bank of England in Britain.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority has warned the banking industry that the record-breaking \u00a359.5m fine levied on Barclays for attempting to manipulate interest rates might not be the last as an international investigation into the activities of other banks is being continued. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the City regulator, said that a \"number of other significant cross-border investigations in this area\" were under way involving other banks. \"The action against Barclays should leave firms in no doubt about the serious consequences of this type of failure,\" she said. The bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those co-operating with the authorities. The total fines levied against Barclays reach \u00a3290m when penalties to settle actions with the US department of justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are included. They follow an investigation of the activities of its traders in London, New York and Tokyo. Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays, insisted that the events \"fell well short of the standards to which Barclays aspires in the conduct of its business\". \"When we identified those issues, we took prompt action to fix them and co-operated extensively and proactively with the authorities,\" Diamond said in a statement. He and the chairman Marcus Agius spoke to shareholders to try to reassure them about the impact of the affair, which could have resulted in an \u00a385m fine from the FSA if the bank had failed to co-operate. One investor said: \"The company needs to urgently convince shareholders that this is not symptomatic of wider ethical business failures.\" Barclays refuses to disclose how many employees were caught up in the affair and how many have left or face disciplinary action, although it is known that some employees connected to the affair have left. The account of the long-running saga provided by the CFTC showed that Barclays attempted to manipulate, and made false reports concerning, two global benchmark interest rates \"on numerous occasions and sometimes on a daily basis over a four-year period, starting as early as 2005\". The benchmarks referred to are the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor). They are used by the financial industry to set the rates of interest that households and major companies pay to borrow. Banks are asked which rate they think they will be able to borrow from each other for periods of time ranging from overnight to 12 months in currencies including sterling, US dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. The rates are then submitted to the British Bankers' Association which publishes the \"fix\" each day. The actions against Barclays show how crucial the rate became during the financial crisis when the management of the bank was worried about the negative publicity surrounding the higher rates it was submitting compared with its rivals. In October 2008, in the days before other banks were bailed out, a \"submitter\" \u2013 one of the Barclays traders responsible for submitting rates \u2013 remarked that \"manager E asked me to put it lower than it was yesterday \u2026 to send the message that we're not in the shit\". The FSA admits that a miscommunication may have occurred after a conversation between Barclays management and the Bank of England. \"No instruction was given to Barclays to lower its Libor submission during this telephone conversation. However, as the substance of the telephone conversation as relayed down the chain of command at Barclays, a misunderstanding or miscommunication occurred. This meant that Barclays submitters believed mistakenly that they were operating under an instruction from the Bank of England to reduce Barclays' Libor submissions.\" The other part of the offence relates to the breakdown in systems controls at Barclays that allowed interest rate traders to work with \"submitters\" to make the rates suit the traders' and the bank's purposes. It was not until 20 May 2009 that requests to submitters were rebuffed by an email that said: \"Sorry I can't do that \u2013 compliance would have a real issue with that.\" The impact went far beyond London. David Meister, the CFTC's director of enforcement, said: \"The American public and our markets rely upon the integrity of benchmark interest rates such as Libor and Euribor because they form the basis for hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions.\" Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, said that the regulation of Libor arrangements now needed to be reviewed. \"We need to know what the government plans to do to prevent traders manipulating the independent interest rates between the banks for their own advantage.\" said Leslie.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ivan Glasenberg, the billionaire chief executive of commodity trader Glencore, was forced into a humiliating retreat on Wednesday night as he postponed next month's extraordinary general meeting for shareholders to vote on the group's proposed \u00a350bn merger with miner Xstrata. The move came on another dramatic day for the deal as Xstrata hastily rewrote the terms of the \u00a3240m retention packages for its top management that threatened to derail the merger. The revisions caused the mining firm to suspend its own shareholder meeting, scheduled to follow Glencore's. The tearing up of the two companies' timetables followed Tuesday night's news that 11% shareholder Qatar Holdings would oppose the merger unless Glencore offered a higher price. Despite the frantic amendments to the deal's terms, the City is growing increasingly sceptical that there will be a merger, which has long been considered to be the reason behind Glencore's flotation on the London Stock Exchange last year. Investors said controversy over the retention payments, including almost \u00a329m for Xstrata chief executive Mick Davis, may not yet have subsided. Smaller investors are also likely to feel emboldened to campaign for a higher price now they have the backing of a large investor. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said: \"Ivan [Glasenberg] has got a real problem on his hands. He wants to own this asset [Xstrata] and thinks that now is very good timing to own this asset. \"But the problem that he is now confronting is that there is a body of shareholders who strongly believe the terms need changing. There is a real risk for Glencore that the Qataris could keep buying and that therefore the acceptable bid price rises in the future.\" Sources close to the deal said representatives of Glencore and Qatar Holdings had met on Wednesday to discuss the differing valuations \u2013 but nothing has been resolved and the meetings will continue. So far the principals have not been involved in discussions. Glencore is offering 2.8 of its shares for every Xstrata share, while Qatar Holdings (QH) says the deal should be done on a 3.25 ratio. However, Glencore still holds some cards, including the belief that Xstrata's share price will collapse if it walks away from the merger proposal. Christopher LaFemina, a mining analyst with Jeffries, said: \"The value of the $4.26bn investment QH has made in Xstrata since the 7 February merger announcement would likely fall sharply. \"Moreover, we are concerned that the longer-term Xstrata investment case has deteriorated due to negative structural changes to the thermal coal market, increased geopolitical risk ... and a management team and board that may have lost some credibility in the market due to the perceived low merger ratio and management retention awards, which are not performance based.\" Until the Qataris' intervention on Tuesday, the City had assumed the sovereign wealth fund was preparing to throw its sizeable stake \u2013 most of which had been amassed since the merger proposal was announced \u2013 behind the deal. When asked if the stake-building had been opportunistic, a source close to QH insisted: \"They're not in it to flip it and get out [at a quick profit] again.\" Wednesday's statement from Xstrata attempted to placate investors by agreeing to pay retention awards \"entirely in shares\", adding that the payments would be \"subject to performance criteria based on realising additional cost savings as a result of the merger\". Xstrata's embattled chairman, Sir John Bond, said: \"Xstrata's executive management and independent non-executive directors are sensitive to the perspective and concerns of our shareholders in the current environment and we have listened to the feedback we have received since publishing the merger documents.\"",

The revisions caused the mining firm to suspend its own shareholder meeting, scheduled to follow Glencore's.</p> <p>The tearing up of the two companies' timetables followed Tuesday night's news that 11% shareholder Qatar Holdings would oppose the merger unless Glencore offered a higher price.</p> <p>Despite the frantic amendments to the deal's terms, the City is growing increasingly sceptical that there will be a merger, which has long been considered to be the reason behind Glencore's flotation on the London Stock Exchange last year.</p> <p>Investors said controversy over the retention payments, including almost \u00a329m for Xstrata chief executive Mick Davis, may not yet have subsided. Smaller investors are also likely to feel emboldened to campaign for a higher price now they have the backing of a large investor.</p> <p>Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said: \"Ivan [Glasenberg] has got a real problem on his hands. He wants to own this asset [Xstrata] and thinks that now is very good timing to own this asset.</p> <p>\"But the problem that he is now confronting is that there is a body of shareholders who strongly believe the terms need changing. There is a real risk for Glencore that the Qataris could keep buying and that therefore the acceptable bid price rises in the future.\"</p> <p>Sources close to the deal said representatives of Glencore and Qatar Holdings had met on Wednesday to discuss the differing valuations \u2013 but nothing has been resolved and the meetings will continue. So far the principals have not been involved in discussions. Glencore is offering 2.8 of its shares for every Xstrata share, while Qatar Holdings (QH) says the deal should be done on a 3.25 ratio. However, Glencore still holds some cards, including the belief that Xstrata's share price will collapse if it walks away from the merger proposal.</p> <p>Christopher LaFemina, a mining analyst with Jeffries, said: \"The value of the $4.26bn investment QH has made in Xstrata since the 7 February merger announcement would likely fall sharply.</p> <p>\"Moreover, we are concerned that the longer-term Xstrata investment case has deteriorated due to negative structural changes to the thermal coal market, increased geopolitical risk ... and a management team and board that may have lost some credibility in the market due to the perceived low merger ratio and management retention awards, which are not performance based.\"</p> <p>Until the Qataris' intervention on Tuesday, the City had assumed the sovereign wealth fund was preparing to throw its sizeable stake \u2013 most of which had been amassed since the merger proposal was announced \u2013 behind the deal. When asked if the stake-building had been opportunistic, a source close to QH insisted: \"They're not in it to flip it and get out [at a quick profit] again.\"</p> <p>Wednesday's statement from Xstrata attempted to placate investors by agreeing to pay retention awards \"entirely in shares\", adding that the payments would be \"subject to performance criteria based on realising additional cost savings as a result of the merger\".</p> <p>Xstrata's embattled chairman, Sir John Bond, said: \"Xstrata's executive management and independent non-executive directors are sensitive to the perspective and concerns of our shareholders in the current environment and we have listened to the feedback we have received since publishing the merger documents.\"</p>",

Qatar Holdings, by buying 11% of Xstrata and declaring that the terms of Glencore's merger proposal are too mean, has pinned him against a wall. Pay more or the deal is dead, is its blunt message to the multi-billionaire. But pay how much more? The Qataris say a ratio of 3.25 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share would be a \"more appropriate distribution of the benefits of the merger\" than Glencore's intended ratio of 2.8. OK, but is 3.25 a line in the sand or an opening pitch? It's impossible to know from the outside. The Qataris' chief advantage has been surprise, and their best tactic now would be to keep Glasenberg guessing. In other words: tell him that support is guaranteed at 3.25; anything less and he's taking a risk. Qatar can be confident that the Glencore boss will go higher (and perhaps even to 3.25), whatever he said on day one about mergers of equals not requiring takeover premiums. The truth is that Glasenberg has been desperate to buy Xstrata for years and is not about to bow out just because a sovereign wealth fund, against form, has had the gumption to fight for fair terms. That's doubly true if Sir John Bond, Xstrata's chairman, has eaten enough humble pie on the retention awards to persuade UK pension funds to back down. Bond's latest version is a mess, it should be said. The awards for Xstrata's top nine executives, including big boss Mick Davis, will be tied to performance but the payments to the other 64 managers won't be. The nine will be asked to find cost savings of $350m (\u00a3225m) \u2013 but that's a meaningless figure without knowing the intended level of the combined group's capital expenditure. Still, Bond has conceded that the retention payments should be made in shares, and not cash. That's a big U-turn and may persuade some funds to hold their noses, even if the windfall for the executives, now it is denominated in stock, could soar beyond \u00a3173m. For his next trick, Bond will have to explain why, having botched the retention issue and rolled over meekly on the original merger terms, he still deserves to chair Glenstrata, or even an still-independent Xstrata if that's how the dust settles.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group agreed on Wednesday to press ahead with a sale of 632 branches to the Co-operative Bank after it rejected a rival offer from the private equity start-up NBNK. Lloyds said agreement over the terms of a deal had put the bank in a position to choose the Co-op over NBNK and move towards a sale of the branches on an exclusive basis. The deal is already three months behind schedule and has come under fire from critics who want the government, which owns 39% of Lloyds, to create a more diverse banking sector. Lloyds was forced to sell the branches to satisfy European state aid laws. The Co-op will grab a 7% share of the current account market should the sale of the Verde group of branches go through, boosting its standing on the high street and propelling it into the major league of UK retail banks. Lloyds said in a statement after the stock market closed: \"Lloyds Banking Group has made considerable progress with the Co-operative Group on the Verde transaction. [Lloyds] and Co-op now have an understanding on the commercial terms for the transaction. This is subject to agreeing satisfactory documentation, the approval of their respective boards, and further discussions with the FSA, Treasury and the European commission. The chief financial regulator, the FSA and the Treasury are understood to be concerned that the branches are accompanied by a significant amount of financial reserves to stay within regulatory rules. Lloyds said the Verde business would have equity capital of \u00a31.5bn to protect customers in the event of a run on the bank. The move is a blow to NBNK, which is fronted by former Lloyd's of London chairman Lord Levene, and run by former Northern Rock chief executive Gary Hoffman. Only hours before it was rebuffed, the fledgling start-up made a renewed bid for the branches which it hoped would steal a march on the Co-op. The latest results for NBNK show it lost \u00a323m in its last financial year after it failed to trump Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group in the bidding war to take Northern Rock private. A lack of bid targets meant the company planned to return its remaining cash to shareholders, though this amounted to only 40%. Hoffman, said: \"We are disappointed that the door has now been closed on this opportunity, with the result that we will be unable to deliver our vision of banking, bringing a vibrant new challenger to the high street, devoted to providing the level of service that customers want and deserve. We would have provided more local decision making, flexible opening hours, new modern systems and a guarantee of no short-term bonuses \u2013 everything we believe that people want.\" The Unite union, which represents staff at Lloyds, said it was seeking assurances from the bank that jobs would be protected. It said: \"Months of speculation and negotiations have left the Lloyds banking workforce feeling vulnerable. The decision by the European commission to force Lloyds Banking Group to divest a significant number of its branches as a condition of receiving state aid places under threat 9,000 employees.\" The Co-op has yet to make any assurances concerning the branches, which include the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester network, Lloyds TSB branches in Scotland, and several call centres and operations offices in Sunderland, Swansea and Livingston. The Co-op said in a statement that discussions had made good progress, but was unable to say when an agreement would be signed. It added: \"There can be no certainty that a transaction will be completed. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\" The Lloyds share price had risen 2.4% earlier in the day along with other listed banking shares.",

Only hours before it was rebuffed, the fledgling start-up made a renewed bid for the branches which it hoped would steal a march on the Co-op.</p> <p>The latest results for NBNK show it lost \u00a323m in its last financial year after it failed to trump Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group in the bidding war to take Northern Rock private.</p> <p>A lack of bid targets meant the company planned to return its remaining cash to shareholders, though this amounted to only 40%.</p> <p>Hoffman, said: \"We are disappointed that the door has now been closed on this opportunity, with the result that we will be unable to deliver our vision of banking, bringing a vibrant new challenger to the high street, devoted to providing the level of service that customers want and deserve. We would have provided more local decision making, flexible opening hours, new modern systems and a guarantee of no short-term bonuses \u2013 everything we believe that people want.\"</p> <p>The Unite union, which represents staff at Lloyds, said it was seeking assurances from the bank that jobs would be protected. It said: \"Months of speculation and negotiations have left the Lloyds banking workforce feeling vulnerable. The decision by the European commission to force Lloyds Banking Group to divest a significant number of its branches as a condition of receiving state aid places under threat 9,000 employees.\"</p> <p>The Co-op has yet to make any assurances concerning the branches, which include the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester network, Lloyds TSB branches in Scotland, and several call centres and operations offices in Sunderland, Swansea and Livingston.</p> <p>The Co-op said in a statement that discussions had made good progress, but was unable to say when an agreement would be signed. It added: \"There can be no certainty that a transaction will be completed. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\"</p> <p>The Lloyds share price had risen 2.4% earlier in the day along with other listed banking shares.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "News that Spain and Cyprus see bailout requests accepted buoys investors as EU prepares to meet", 
      "body": "<p>On a positive day for the market on some signs of hope in the eurozone crisis, chip maker <strong>Arm </strong>was one of the big gainers.</p> <p>The Apple supplier added 13.8p to 497.4p after a hefty buy note from Charles Stanley. The broker said:</p> <blockquote> Investing in Arm is not going to be a short term \"flipper\", given its already high valuation. Rather, it should be seen as a core holding on a 10 year view, providing exposure to a key sector which will experience volatility but, over the long term, will be propelled by massive drivers. <br> A move by Apple to use Mali graphics in the iPhone and/or iPad would have a significant impact, but this seems unlikely to happen this year. A move to use Arm in the MacBook Air would be a major move. Whether this occurs this year, or next, is likely to depend on how good the Windows RT laptops are. However it would have a huge impact. Any use of Arm servers by one of the major data centre owners such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook would also be very significant. However, they may also wait for 64-bit technology or greater maturity of Arm's 32-bit products and ecosystem.  The common theme here is that there could be significant catalysts around the fourth quarter this year, but that a more prudent expectation would be that they arrive, if indeed they do (and are announced), up to a year later. </blockquote> <p>Overall, markets were in a reasonable mood ahead of the key EU summit on Thursday and Friday. Talk of China planning further measures to stimulate its economy made for a positive start, and news that Spain and Cyprus had seen their bailout requests accepted also boosted sentiment. In the US there were positive housing and manufactured goods figures. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 76.96 points higher at 5523.92.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was lifted 1.06p to 31.155p on hopes it will finally clinch the disposal of the branches it needs to sell to meet EU state aid rules, with the Co-operative bank the favourite to buy the business. But new banking venture NBNK, led by former Northern Rock executive Gary Hoffman, also said it had made a revised offer for the branches. No announcement appeared before the market closed, however.</p> <p>Banking shares in general were edging higher on hopes a deal to support the crisis-hit eurozone financial system could finally be hammered out. So apart from Lloyds, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 5.4p to 233.1p - despite the continuing concerns about its current computer chaos - and <strong>Barclays</strong> was 3.65p better at 196.05p, as investors shook off the record fine for the bank manipulating libor rates.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> closed 41p higher at \u00a313.75 after the Asia-focussed bank said it expected double digit income growth for the full year despite falling below that level for the first half. Its wealth management business has been hit by the problems in the eurozone, while investors have been concerned about the prospects of slowing growth in its key markets such as China and India. Investec repeated its buy recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The Indian rupee has depreciated 7% year to date, (and rather more since February) while in 2011, India contributed 12% of group pretax profit. As such, given an associated foreign exchange drag of around 2% to first half income growth, for Standard to remain broadly on track to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth for 2012 is a fantastic achievement, we believe, and a wake-up call to those who have more recently lost the faith. Top-line growth is wholesale-led but broad-based, and coupled with a 4% dividend yield, Standard offers a unique and enticing investment. <br> </blockquote> <p>Canaccord Genuity was less positive, issuing a sell note:</p> <blockquote> We don't see value in Standard at these [share price] levels but do see consensus earnings risk given that consensus forecasts double-digit pretax profit growth for 2012 and 2013. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>BT</strong> was up 4.7p at 205.4p after analysts at Barclays issued an overweight rating on the telecoms business, although they cut their price target from 275p to 260p.</p> <p><strong>Icap</strong> led the fallers, down 14.2p at 345.5p. But this was due to shares in the interdealer broker going ex-dividend. <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> was 11p lower at 634.5p for a similar reason, although the company announced a US court had ruled in its favour in a dispute with Whitefox Technologies. The court case related to equipment and technology supplied for use in Tate's US ethanol plants, which Tate said were not fit for purpose. Panmure Gordon analysts Graham Jones estimated the award to Tate was in the low double digit millions of pounds. However Whitefox said it would appeal the decision.</p> <p><strong>Man</strong> added 0.9p to 72.9p after the hedge fund group reported a weekly 1.1% gain in its key AHL fund. It said:</p> <blockquote> Jittery sentiment caused risk and resource assets to slump over the week as key economic indicators rang alarm bells over global economic growth. Against this backdrop AHL posted a gain thanks to bearish positioning in metals, energies and stocks. </blockquote> <p><strong>Shire</strong> rose 14p to \u00a319.12 on revived takeover talk following recent falls in the wake of a US decision to allow generic competition to its key Adderall hyperactivity treatment sooner than expected.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Debenhams</strong> added 1.85p to 83.25p ahead of a trading update on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "On a positive day for the market on some signs of hope in the eurozone crisis, chip maker Arm was one of the big gainers. The Apple supplier added 13.8p to 497.4p after a hefty buy note from Charles Stanley. The broker said: Investing in Arm is not going to be a short term \"flipper\", given its already high valuation. Rather, it should be seen as a core holding on a 10 year view, providing exposure to a key sector which will experience volatility but, over the long term, will be propelled by massive drivers. A move by Apple to use Mali graphics in the iPhone and/or iPad would have a significant impact, but this seems unlikely to happen this year. A move to use Arm in the MacBook Air would be a major move. Whether this occurs this year, or next, is likely to depend on how good the Windows RT laptops are. However it would have a huge impact. Any use of Arm servers by one of the major data centre owners such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook would also be very significant. However, they may also wait for 64-bit technology or greater maturity of Arm's 32-bit products and ecosystem. The common theme here is that there could be significant catalysts around the fourth quarter this year, but that a more prudent expectation would be that they arrive, if indeed they do (and are announced), up to a year later. Overall, markets were in a reasonable mood ahead of the key EU summit on Thursday and Friday. Talk of China planning further measures to stimulate its economy made for a positive start, and news that Spain and Cyprus had seen their bailout requests accepted also boosted sentiment. In the US there were positive housing and manufactured goods figures. So the FTSE 100 finished 76.96 points higher at 5523.92. Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 1.06p to 31.155p on hopes it will finally clinch the disposal of the branches it needs to sell to meet EU state aid rules, with the Co-operative bank the favourite to buy the business. But new banking venture NBNK, led by former Northern Rock executive Gary Hoffman, also said it had made a revised offer for the branches. No announcement appeared before the market closed, however. Banking shares in general were edging higher on hopes a deal to support the crisis-hit eurozone financial system could finally be hammered out. So apart from Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 5.4p to 233.1p - despite the continuing concerns about its current computer chaos - and Barclays was 3.65p better at 196.05p, as investors shook off the record fine for the bank manipulating libor rates. Standard Chartered closed 41p higher at \u00a313.75 after the Asia-focussed bank said it expected double digit income growth for the full year despite falling below that level for the first half. Its wealth management business has been hit by the problems in the eurozone, while investors have been concerned about the prospects of slowing growth in its key markets such as China and India. Investec repeated its buy recommendation, saying: The Indian rupee has depreciated 7% year to date, (and rather more since February) while in 2011, India contributed 12% of group pretax profit. As such, given an associated foreign exchange drag of around 2% to first half income growth, for Standard to remain broadly on track to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth for 2012 is a fantastic achievement, we believe, and a wake-up call to those who have more recently lost the faith. Top-line growth is wholesale-led but broad-based, and coupled with a 4% dividend yield, Standard offers a unique and enticing investment. Canaccord Genuity was less positive, issuing a sell note: We don't see value in Standard at these [share price] levels but do see consensus earnings risk given that consensus forecasts double-digit pretax profit growth for 2012 and 2013. BT was up 4.7p at 205.4p after analysts at Barclays issued an overweight rating on the telecoms business, although they cut their price target from 275p to 260p. Icap led the fallers, down 14.2p at 345.5p. But this was due to shares in the interdealer broker going ex-dividend. Tate and Lyle was 11p lower at 634.5p for a similar reason, although the company announced a US court had ruled in its favour in a dispute with Whitefox Technologies. The court case related to equipment and technology supplied for use in Tate's US ethanol plants, which Tate said were not fit for purpose. Panmure Gordon analysts Graham Jones estimated the award to Tate was in the low double digit millions of pounds. However Whitefox said it would appeal the decision. Man added 0.9p to 72.9p after the hedge fund group reported a weekly 1.1% gain in its key AHL fund. It said: Jittery sentiment caused risk and resource assets to slump over the week as key economic indicators rang alarm bells over global economic growth. Against this backdrop AHL posted a gain thanks to bearish positioning in metals, energies and stocks. Shire rose 14p to \u00a319.12 on revived takeover talk following recent falls in the wake of a US decision to allow generic competition to its key Adderall hyperactivity treatment sooner than expected. Elsewhere Debenhams added 1.85p to 83.25p ahead of a trading update on Thursday. Analyst Nick Bubb said: Debenhams are pretty good at painting their performance in favourable light, so it will be interesting to see what kind of mood the management are in tomorrow when they report on trading for the 17 weeks since the end of February. Given tough comparisons, unhelpful spring/summer weather and some store revamp disruption, the market seems braced for some weak sales numbers, a fall in like for like sales of around 1%, even if gross margins never seem to be as bad as might have been expected, given constant \"Sale\" activity. The share price has been relatively firm since the share buyback started at the end of April, but tomorrow will be a key test. But speciality chemicals group Yule Catto dropped 38.9p to 138p after it issued a downbeat trading statement. It said challenging trading conditions were continuing, with demand in Europe and north America weaker now than in the first few months of the year. In Asia it was hit by weak demand for its nitrile latex business, with increased competition leading to aggressive price cuts. This was likely to continue into next year, hitting operating profits in its Asia division.",

Grocers were the most optimistic after footwear and leather retailers, who all reported the biggest rise in sales since the end of 2010, which was the last time the economy was recovering strongly from the financial crisis.</p> <p>Yet retailers considered the volume of sales to be below average for the time of year, giving an index figure of -10%, and stock levels fell back relative to expected demand.</p> <p>Earlier this month official figures showed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/29/uk-retail-sales-improve-june\" title=\"\">rise in retail sales in May</a> after a collapse in demand during the spring months that mirrored the economy's slump into recession.</p> <p>Taking several months together, the signs are that sales remain subdued, though rising slowly from the eurozone-induced panic of a few months ago.</p> <p>Judith McKenna, chair of the CBI distributive trades panel and Asda's chief operating officer, said: \"Retailers have continued to report strong growth in both their sales and orders.

      "bodyText": "The Queen's diamond jubilee boosted retail sales in June, but shop sales remained subdued for the time of year, according to a survey by the CBI. Almost six out of 10 retailers reported a rise in sales compared with 17% who said sales had fallen, giving an overall figure for the CBI's distributive trades index of +42% \u2013 the strongest reading since December 2010. Retailers across most sectors expect orders and sales to continue increasing over the next few months. Grocers were the most optimistic after footwear and leather retailers, who all reported the biggest rise in sales since the end of 2010, which was the last time the economy was recovering strongly from the financial crisis. Yet retailers considered the volume of sales to be below average for the time of year, giving an index figure of -10%, and stock levels fell back relative to expected demand. Earlier this month official figures showed a rise in retail sales in May after a collapse in demand during the spring months that mirrored the economy's slump into recession. Taking several months together, the signs are that sales remain subdued, though rising slowly from the eurozone-induced panic of a few months ago. Judith McKenna, chair of the CBI distributive trades panel and Asda's chief operating officer, said: \"Retailers have continued to report strong growth in both their sales and orders. The jubilee provided a much-needed boost to our high streets with many families and communities making the most of the bank holiday and coming together to celebrate. \"However, it is notable that sales were still considered to be below par for the time of year. Weak consumer confidence and uncertainty over the economic outlook are still putting a brake on consumer spending across the whole retail sector.\" A steep fall in inflation since last autumn, led by declining petrol prices, has boosted consumer spending power, especially in recent months. Wage rises have remained at around 2% while price increases have fallen from an annual rate of 5.2% last year at the peak to 2.8% last month. The gap between wages and rising prices has closed, but some economists fear households are dipping into their savings and curtailing pension payments to maintain their spending and standard of living. More than 1.5 million people have stopped paying into a pension in the last two years. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the CBI's figures were more buoyant than expected and showed the high street experienced solid gains in June after a similar rise in May. \"The message from the official and survey data combined is that retail sales may have risen by at least 1% in the second quarter, which should have provided a welcome boost to the flagging economy and may even help the country lift out of its double-dip recession,\" he said. \"While the May rise was attributable to a rebound in clothing and footwear sales from April, when bad weather had hit sales of seasonal items, the CBI linked the June increase to higher spending around the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations. \"The suggestion is, therefore, that the recent improvements in sales are due to temporary factors and that sales will weaken again in the third quarter. \"However, retailers reporting to the CBI survey grew increasingly optimistic in June, with the net balance relating to expected sales in the coming month rising to the highest since January 2011, up from +25% [for] June to +32% [for] July. \"It is possible, therefore, that we are seeing some upturn in consumer spending due to higher employment and lower inflation, which has reduced the squeeze on incomes that dampened spending so severely last year.\"",

The report suggests that the Co-op will inject capital from its already indebted retail arm and, potentially, its pension fund ... perhaps a little worrying for those who are members of the scheme.

      "bodyText": "Xstrata and Glencore are hastily rewriting the terms of their \u00a350bn tie-up in an effort to stem a mounting shareholder revolt over \u00a3240m of retention packages for top Xstrata management which threatens to derail the merger. Glencore told the stock market on Wednesday that it was considering proposals put forward by Xstrata to change the pay deals but made no reference to the stunning intervention by a major shareholder in Xstrata to reject the price being paid by Glencore. One of the stock market's highest profile mergers, the deal is on the brink of collapse after Qatar, the sovereign wealth fund that has amassed a stake of over 10% in Xstrata, said late last night that it wanted a higher price. The intervention by Qatar came at the end of a day of frenzied speculation that the management of Xstrata had been rethinking the terms of the tie-up with its largest shareholder Glencore because of controversial retention packages for 73 Xstrata staff. On Wednesday Glencore confirmed potential changes: \"Glencore confirms that it has received a proposal from the board of Xstrata in relation to certain amendments to the management incentive arrangements that were proposed in the scheme documents.\" Qatar made no reference to the retention packages in its surprise statement, issued after the markets had closed on Tuesday, that it wanted the terms offered by Glencore \u2013 which is offering 2.8 of its shares for every Xstrata share \u2013 to be raised. Until now, the City had assumed that the sovereign wealth fund was preparing to throw its sizeable stake, which has been amassed since the deal was first announced in February, behind the deal. Performance conditions are likely to be attached to the retention packages which include \u00a329m for Xstrata chief executive Mick Davis, who can walk away with the entire sum in two years if he leaves under certain circumstances. The Qatar fund, which is being advised by bankers at Lazard, caught both companies on the hop after saying that \"whilst it sees merit in a combination of the two companies\" it wanted the terms set at 3.25 new Glencore shares for every existing Xstrata share. These terms, it said, \"would provide a more appropriate distribution of benefits of the merger whilst properly recognising the intrinsic stand-alone value of Xstrata\". Xstrata shares opened 1% higher at 793p while Glencore edged 0.5% lower to 301.5p. There are just days before any changes to the deal can be made under the City's strict Takeover Panel code if the votes are to proceed on 12 July and amid a mounting wave of shareholder anger about the retention packages. Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Schroders, who has opposed the terms from the outset, said late on Tuesday: \"It is time to take the deal off the table and come back with new terms. From day one we've said this is a deal Glencore needed more than Xstrata given Xstrata's balance sheet and cash flow. The strengths of Xstrata's balance sheet and cash flow was never reflected in the exchange ratio\". On 12 July Xstrata shareholders are supposed to vote not only on the terms of the deal but also the retention packages. Unusually, the two votes are linked \u2013 if shareholders vote against the pay deals the merger will fall through. The deal had already looked to be in doubt after one of the most vocal opponents declared on Monday that there was \"no support\" for the transaction, which has been expected ever since Glencore floated on the stock market last year. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, also indicated that he felt the position of Davis was in doubt. \"I think to preserve the integrity of the board \u2026 they're almost going to have to hand over to Glencore, makes it a takeover rather than a merger and that might involve Mick Davis standing down. \"Without that change of tack I just don't see how the deal can actually go through now.
