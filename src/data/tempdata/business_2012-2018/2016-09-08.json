      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the point of budget repair if 725,000 Australians are unemployed and a further 1,067,000 people are underemployed? At its most basic level, economic policy is about maximising the speed at which an economy can sustainably grow to ensure the pool of unemployed and underemployed workers is as small as possible. The superficially strong 3.3% annual GDP growth rate in this week\u2019s national accounts would normally signal a stronger labour market. The skewing of that growth to exports of bulk commodities, where employment is small, means the domestic side of the economy is still not growing fast enough to attain full employment. There was also a significant contribution to GDP from government demand, something that flies in the face of the government\u2019s obsession with budget repair. It is unclear where economic policy is currently being aimed. The policy priority is to reduce spending to ensure the deficit is as low as possible and to return to budget surplus. Such policies take money from the economy and by definition, growth slows and with that, the rate of job creation softens and unemployment is higher than it would otherwise be. The positive influences of expansionary fiscal policy are summed up well in the current year 12 high school economics text book (Australia in the Global Economy 2016 edition; Tim Dixon &amp; John O\u2019Mahony): \u201cAn expansionary fiscal policy involving increased spending or tax cuts would accelerate economic growth \u2026 in stimulating aggregate demand, expansionary fiscal policy can help reduce unemployment.\u201d It is base-case economics. What is concerning is that the current slack \u2013 or underutilisation \u2013 in the labour market is about as severe as during the early 1990s recession. This is because the highly flexible labour market, with an increasingly skilled and talented workforce, has been limited to achieving annual pay increases of just 2% \u2013 about the same as the low point for wages in and around the last recession in the early 1990s. The duration where the economy has seen sub-2.5% wages growth is longer than at any stage during the early 1990s recession. The degree of slack is now extreme. With the unemployment rate having been stuck above 5.5% for four years, it may simply be the case that policy makers are complacent about unemployment. Given a choice between a return to budget surplus in three years, or entrenching unemployment below 600,000 people (or 5%) of the workforce, the government is choosing the budget surplus. As the former treasury secretary Ted Evans once noted, policy makers largely choose the unemployment rate they wish to live with. In other words, policies can be implemented that will lower the unemployment rate. They may involve spending on education, skills and training, or dealing with wage rates and industrial relations reform. Or it could be a simple fiscal stimulus where money is injected into the economy in infrastructure building programs. Take your pick if your goal is full employment. Scott Morrison has indicated that budget repair is his priority. On the latest projections, the existing policy framework has the unemployment rate holding at a high 5.5% over the next few years. If there is any attempt to hasten the return to surplus outside the automatic stabilisers, or \u201crepair\u201d the budget via spending cuts, the outlook for people without jobs will remain bleak. The Coalition\u2019s slogan during the election campaign revolved around \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. It can deliver on that pledge with some job-friendly policies over the next few months but it may mean delaying a return to surplus. It is likely that many of those now unemployed and underemployed don\u2019t give two hoots whether the budget deficit is $6bn or $16bn and would prefer a government that was able to provide a framework where more jobs could be created.

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s plans to drill for oil in the pristine marine reserve of the Great Australian Bight will come under fresh scrutiny, as senators seek to reinstate a lapsed inquiry examining the company\u2019s proposal. But it could be a race against time, since the regulator assessing BP\u2019s environmental plans is set to make a decision on whether to approve two of the wells, inside the marine park, by 19 September. In response, activists have called on the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) to reject BP\u2019s application. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young was in Ceduna in South Australia this week, visiting fisheries, councillors and tourism operators who could be affected by an oil spill in the area. \u201cThe interesting thing about being here in the last two days is just how widespread the concern is from the communities along the coast,\u201d she told Guardian Australia on Thursday. \u201cEven for those who were reluctant to say they are opposed \u2013 they say they haven\u2019t been given enough information, that they have been locked out of consultation.\u201d Hanson-Young said she would seek to re-establish the lapsed inquiry when parliament resumed next week. She said on her trip around the Great Australian Bight she found strong opposition from most quarters. \u201cMany locals and the oyster growers feel as though very little information about the drilling has been made available to them and are very concerned about what\u2019s coming down the line,\u201d Hanson-Young said. With the regulator poised to make a decision about whether to accept one of BP\u2019s environmental plans within weeks, potentially receiving an approval before the inquiry begins, Hanson-Young said approval should not be rushed. \u201cThe only people who want to rush this is BP because they want to make money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not in anyone else\u2019s interest to rush this. And yet we hear that BP is arrogantly moving ahead. They\u2019ve built the rig. It\u2019s waiting to be brought here in weeks or months.\u201d The inquiry was initiated in the previous parliament by former Greens senator Robert Simms and independent Nick Xenophon, with the backing of Labor. In the course of the inquiry, before the parliament was dissolved for the July election, the Senate heard evidence that the approval process for offshore oil exploration was overly secretive, with all the major documents like environmental plans and safety assessments hidden from the public and from those who might be affected by the operation. Even BP\u2019s modelling of any potential spills has been kept secret, leaving the Wilderness Society to commission its own, which showed a spill could affect the entire southern coast of Australia. A spokeswoman for Xenophon told Guardian Australia he would also seek to re-establish the inquiry. Labor\u2019s spokesman for environment and water, Tony Burke, said that there were \u201celements to BP\u2019s plan that we need to know more about\u201d. \u201cThe project certainly seems to be quite different to other drilling operations, so I\u2019ll be seeking further information from relevant parties, including the proponent, Nopsema and environmental scientists,\u201d Burke said. If the new members of the committee don\u2019t agree to restart the lapsed inquiry, the Senate would need to start a new inquiry. Without the support of the Coalition, it would require the backing of Labor, Greens, Xenophon and one more. Wilderness Society campaigner Jess Lerch said the fact that senators felt they had not been given enough information should ring alarm bells. \u201cBP is required to undertake adequate consultation as part of the approval process, but it has been an utter farce, with BP continually refusing to provide full information about its plans and the risks they present to stakeholders and the community,\u201d Lerch said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s offshore oil and gas authority, Nopsema, clearly must reject BP\u2019s applications to drill in the Bight, including its latest Environmental Plan after two previous applications were sent back.\u201d BP has had its environmental plan for four wells in the Great Australian Bight rejected twice by Nopsema. The agency said the plans did not meet regulatory requirements, but since the plans are kept secret, it is not known what BP proposed to do that was not considered safe. Nopsema said it usually gave applicants only three chances to resubmit their applications but in August BP submitted a new environmental plan for two of its four wells, which appeared to reset the clock on that part of the application. The Great Australian Bight was included in Australia\u2019s commonwealth marine reserve network, with the federal government concluding it was a \u201cglobally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale\u201d. The reserve was also established because it was an important foraging area for threatened Australian sea lions, threatened white sharks, migratory sperm whales and migratory short-tailed shearwater. The particular part BP has proposed to drill two wells is listed for its benthic invertebrate communities \u2013 animals that live on the very bottom of the seafloor like sea urchins, sea squirts, starfish, shellfish, sponges and lace coral. In such deep waters, the only activity that was likely to disturb them is oil or gas drilling. Hanson-Young said on her fact-finding mission people were often shocked oil exploration would be allowed in a marine reserve. \u201cWhat is the point of having these places if a company can come and drill for oil?\u201d Veteran environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown recently returned from a trip to the Great Australian Bight, and told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt would be very unwise for BP to move that leased oil rig from South Korea\u201d. \u201cThis is rapidly growing into a national and international furore,\u201d he said, saying NOPSEMA appeared to be working too closely with BP, and not giving the public the information it needed to properly scrutinise the plans. An oil spill in the Great Australian Bight could threaten South Australia\u2019s $442m fishing industry and coastal tourism industry, which could be worth more than $1bn and employs almost 7,000 people. In 2010, BP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill, at the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. That occurred in waters that were significantly calmer and more shallow than the wells proposed in the Great Australian Bight. BP maintains that oil and gas exploration can safely coexist with the marine environment. \u201cWe have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning,\u201d a spokeswoman told Guardian Australia earlier this month.",

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo will pay $185m in a settlement over illegal sales practices that included the opening of unauthorized duplicate accounts and credit cards by employees in order to meet sales quotas, it was announced on Thursday. The settlement includes a $100m fine paid to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) \u2013 the largest ever levied by the five-year-old bureau \u2013 a $35m penalty paid to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and a $50m penalty paid to the City and County of Los Angeles. \u201cWells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses,\u201d said CFPB director Richard Cordray. \u201cBecause of the severity of these violations, Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed.\u201d In a statement, Wells Fargo said it \u201creached these agreements consistent with our commitment to customers and in the interest of putting this matter behind us\u201d. The illegal practices were exposed in a lawsuit filed by David Douglas, a long-term Wells Fargo customer. In 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported that at least 30 employees had been fired for opening duplicate accounts without the knowledge of customers. The Guardian subsequently found that sales quotas that employees said led to such accounts being opened were still in place. In 2013, a personal banker working at Wells Fargo was expected to sell 20 products a day. According to Khalid Taha, a former personal banker at Wells Fargo, in 2014 that number dropped to 15 a day. Such products included overdraft insurance, travel insurance, new accounts and credit cards. Speaking to the Guardian in 2015, Taha said the 15-product-a-day quota was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and said every interaction with a customer, many of whom were current users of the bank who just want to get a statement, check their balance or make a payment, took an hour. \u201cYou don\u2019t sell more than a product per customer,\u201d Taha said. \u201cYou can, but it\u2019s not that easy. Most of our customers are current customers. They already have several products.\u201d At the time Taha spoke to the Guardian he was still an employee of Wells Fargo. Now a member of the Committee for Better Banks Los Angeles, he said on Thursday: \u201cThe Wells Fargo sanctions are a long overdue victory for the front-line workers who have been standing together to fight Wells Fargo\u2019s predatory sales practices in Los Angeles for years.\u201d In May 2015, the Los Angeles city attorney filed a lawsuit regarding the practices; by fall of that year the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank and the federal OCC had begun investigations. On a call with reporters on Thursday, regulators said a review of Wells Fargo practices found that about 1.5 million deposit accounts and 565,000 credit cards could have been opened without customers\u2019 permission. About 5,300 employees have been fired during the investigations, the Wall Street Journal reported. The CFPB, which was established under the Dodd-Frank reform act, took action against Wells Fargo for violating consumer financial laws, issuing an order requiring the bank to refund any consumers who paid any fees and charges on unauthorized accounts, hire a consultant to review its sales practices, and pay the $100m fine. Cordray said: \u201cToday\u2019s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences.\u201d In its statement, Wells Fargo said: \u201cWells Fargo is committed to putting our customers\u2019 interests first 100% of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request.\u201d The bank said that as a result of an independent review, customers had already been refunded $2.6m in unwarranted fees. \u201cAccounts refunded represented a fraction of 1% of the accounts reviewed, and refunds averaged $25,\u201d the statement said. Taha added: \u201cWhen I worked at Wells Fargo, I faced the threat of being fired if I didn\u2019t meet their unreasonable sales quotes every day, and it\u2019s high time that Wells Fargo pays for preying on consumers\u2019 financial livelihoods. \u201cBut sanctions on one bank are not enough \u2013 we need to crack down on the hostile work conditions and predatory sales metrics that hurt underpaid bank workers like me and our consumers alike.\u201d",

The UK\u2019s newest technology champion isn\u2019t exactly crowing about reclaiming for the nation bits and pieces of a former famous member of the FTSE 100 index. The omission was wise. First, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s $11bn purchase of Cambridge-based Autonomy in 2011 was the deal that precipitated crises and write-offs at the US firm. The litigation continues, so best for Micro Focus to ensure it has the right legal protections in place and skirt around the contested claims. Second, old Autonomy is unrecognisable today. Many of its products for searching unstructured data have been incorporated into HPE\u2019s software offering. The Autonomy-related stuff represents only about a fifth of HPE\u2019s software division. Third, it would be misleading for Micro Focus to invoke the thrills and spills of the Autonomy era. Its own style is as dull as its name. Micro Focus occupies the unglamorous end of the technology industry, where the money is made by managing and updating legacy infrastructure. It is a fix-it merchant rather than a pioneer. There\u2019s no shame in that, of course, especially when your recent record is as impressive as Micro Focus\u2019s: the share price was 300p in 2011 and is \u00a322 now, up 15% on Thursday as investors applauded the swoop on a chunk of HPE. Enthusiasm is the right reaction if you believe scrutiny under the Micro Focus lens can turn profit margins at the business from 21% to 46% within three years. That\u2019s the promise from executive chairman Kevin Loosemore, who can point to similar surgery performed on past acquisitions. The difference this time is size. Micro Focus is grabbing control of a business bigger than itself. It is a \u00a35bn ($7bn) company making a $8.8bn deal. The complexities will inevitably be greater, but let\u2019s not knock the ambition. Loosemore and co have earned the right to play on a global stage and, after the dispiriting sale of ARM Holdings to SoftBank for \u00a324bn, it\u2019s good that a UK tech company can step up. A dull, but very worthy, deal. Osborne\u2019s grand folly HS2 could be hitting the skids \u201cOften it is modest, rapidly deliverable investments that can have the most immediate impact, particularly on the road network, but also in some places on the rail network,\u201d said Philip Hammond on Thursday. Was the chancellor hinting that HS2 will be ditched? Let\u2019s hope so. The economics of the proposed high-speed railway look more grotesque every time the sums are totted up. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, one of the UK\u2019s biggest investors in infrastructure, said the other day that he wouldn\u2019t dispatch a penny to HS2 because it is of \u201clittle economic benefit\u201d. In reply to a follow-up question from the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, Hammond said he is a great believer in the \u201cEddington principle\u201d that modest, easily deliverable projects are often the most worthwhile. Sir Rod Eddington, former boss of British Airways, wrote a report in 2006 for Darling, transport secretary at the time. Simon Jenkins\u2019 long read on HS2 in this paper in June reminded us what it said: transport policy \u201cneeds to avoid wasting time and money pursuing alluring new super high-speed motorway or rail networks or pursuing grands projets with speculative returns.\u201d Go for it, chancellor: ditch George Osborne\u2019s grand folly. Time for Sports Direct to spread the profits One reason why Mike Ashley burns with resentment about the exposure of pay and working practices in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse may be that, in another corner of the business, his bonus arrangements for a couple of thousand permanent staff has been remarkably generous over the years. A few years ago Sports Direct was being lauded for a scheme whereby some employees, mostly in the stores and head office, were scooping tens of thousands of pounds. In 2013, a lucky \u2013 or hard-working \u2013 2,000 staff shared a \u00a3100m payout in the form of Sports Direct stock. In total, \u00a3250m has been distributed this way, as Ashley often likes to point out. The contrast between the treatment of permanent staff and those on zero-hours and agency contracts is stark. But, if Ashley is serious about reform, one idea should be obvious: distribute the spoils more evenly. Ashley used to say he wanted Sports Direct to be more like John Lewis (before alighting on Selfridges this week) and the bonus system at the employee-owned department store is worth studying: payments are declared annually as a percentage of salary. To work in practice at Sports Direct, many zero-hours and agency workers would have to join the regular payroll; at the moment, only 5,000 out of 27,000 staff are permanent full- or part-time employees. But, since Ashley says wants to boost the ratio of permanent employees, the stars could align. If Sports Direct was regularly distributing equally, say, 10% of its profits to, say, 20,000 staff, public perceptions might alter. The governance grumbles would still have to addressed, of course. But a fairer company-wide bonus scheme would be a start. Ashley, if he wanted to be outrageously cheeky, could even describe it as the logical extension of his original thinking.",

In total, \u00a3250m has been distributed this way, as Ashley often likes to point out.</p> <p>The contrast between the treatment of permanent staff and those on zero-hours and agency contracts is stark. But, if Ashley is serious about reform, one idea should be obvious: distribute the spoils more evenly.</p> <p>Ashley used to say he wanted Sports Direct to be more like John Lewis (before alighting on Selfridges this week) and the bonus system at the employee-owned department store is worth studying: payments are declared annually as a percentage of salary.</p> <p>To work in practice at Sports Direct, many zero-hours and agency workers would have to join the regular payroll; at the moment, only 5,000 out of 27,000 staff are permanent full- or part-time employees. But, since Ashley says wants to boost the ratio of permanent employees, the stars could align.</p> <p>If Sports Direct was regularly distributing equally, say, 10% of its profits to, say, 20,000 staff, public perceptions might alter. The governance grumbles would still have to addressed, of course. But a fairer company-wide bonus scheme would be a start. Ashley, if he wanted to be outrageously cheeky, could even describe it as the logical extension of his original thinking.</p>",

After buying Autonomy for $11bn (\u00a38.3bn), HP later wrote off three-quarters of the company\u2019s value after uncovering what it claimed were accounting irregularities at the hands of the former management team \u2013 claims that have always been strongly rejected by the Autonomy co-founder Mike Lynch and colleagues. HP\u2019s acquisition of Autonomy was supposed to form the central part of the US group\u2019s move into software, but the plan fell apart after the disastrous deal cost HP shareholders billions of dollars in destroyed value. Since the acquisition, parts of Autonomy \u2013 which made corporate search software used by law firms and accountants \u2013 have been offloaded elsewhere, leaving Micro Focus to take on the remaining assets, about 20% of the original Autonomy deal. However, the FTSE 100-listed Micro Focus is keen to stress that the deal will not be a reincarnation of Autonomy in the UK. \u201cAutonomy doesn\u2019t really exist as an entity, just the products,\u201d said Kevin Loosemore, executive chairman of Micro Focus. Loosemore said the Newbury-based business conducted due diligence across all of the products included in the deal, with no different approach taken for the Autonomy assets. No legal liabilities from Autonomy will be transferred to Micro Focus. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, pointed out some of the obvious benefits of the $8.8bn deal for both Micro Focus and HPE: \u201cIt\u2019s a big scalp for the FTSE 100 group, which has been on a buying spree of late, and marks the end of the Autonomy saga for HPE. HPE will no doubt be glad to see the back of Autonomy, which it acquired in 2011 in one of the worst deals in recent corporate history.\u201d Philip Carter at the technology research firm IDC said the deal was a good one for the European tech sector, at a time when European companies were being taken overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a collection of assets that they will have, rather than a seamless business,\u201d Carter added.

      "bodyText": "More than 100 members of the European parliament have signed a letter of support for two whistleblowers convicted by a Luxembourg court of leaking information about secret tax rulings to journalists. Antoine Deltour and Rapha\u00ebl Halet were both convicted of theft earlier this year after providing journalists with evidence that the rulings had helped multinational corporations slash their corporation tax bills to 1% or less. Revelations from the so-called LuxLeaks prompted demands for reform of the international tax system following their publication in 2014 by media organisations, including the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. However, Luxembourg pursued criminal charges against Deltour and Halet with the support of their employer, the accountancy firm PwC, which had arranged the agreements. The MEPs used the letter to call for greater protection for whistleblowers at national and international level. \u201cWe can only but agree with judge Marc Thill who stressed in his deliberations that both of you should be considered as \u2018whistleblowers\u2019 and that the facts which you exposed are of crucial public interest by virtue of their contribution to a more transparent and fairer tax system,\u201d the letter reads. Tax rulings, also known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d, are a practice whereby national tax authorities issue guidance to companies on how their corporation tax will be calculated. Although legal, the use of such rulings has become controversial following both the LuxLeaks reports and the revelation that Ireland allowed Apple to reduce its corporation tax liability for decades through its use of subsidiaries in the country. In 2014, the company paid a corporation tax rate of just 0.005%, according to Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner. Fabio De Masi, the German MEP who organised the letter and vice-president of a committee investigating the Panama Papers, criticised the Luxembourg authorities for also appealing against the acquittal of Edouard Perrin, a French investigative journalist accused of helping Halet. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely absurd that a journalist who covered Luxleaks is being brought to court,\u201d said De Masi. \u201cThis is a fundamental threat to press freedom. It\u2019s his job to cover these issues.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Katie Allen\u2019s news story about the ECB is here, and being updated now: I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, to cover a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. They\u2019ll be considering Greece\u2019s bailout, where Athens has been falling behind its targets. So it could be a lively event. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that Europe\u2019s recovery is faltering. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Eurozone is entangled in a losing battle with faltering growth while static inflation levels continue to question the ECB\u2019s credibility. Although Draghi also suggested that the economic recovery in Europe is likely to be dampened by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, this was still not enough to prompt the central bank to act. While Draghi\u2019s dovish rhetoric may have opened doors for an extension to bond buying program beyond March 2017, the visible disappointment could propel the Euro higher. Markets should be patient, as the European Central Bank will surely boost its QE programme once its staff have worked out the best method. So argues Craig Erlam, market analyst at City firm OANDA. The ECB may not have announced any more policy easing today, or even indicated that further stimulus is likely in the coming months, but Mario Draghi did a fine job in talking up bond yields in the euro area. Perhaps a sly attempt to free up more assets eligible for purchase under the current quantitative easing structure. There were two main takeaways from today\u2019s ECB decision and press conference. The first is that inflation and growth forecasts were lowered but only marginally reflecting the negative, albeit less so than previously expected, impact of the Brexit vote. The other is that the committee has been given a full mandate to redesign QE. In other words, the central bank is approaching the point at which it will no longer be possible to carry out QE in its current form, but it is looking at ways to overcome it. That would explain why they did not announce an extension to the QE program beyond March 2017 today because they must first decide how the program will be adapted. That is not to say it won\u2019t be. In fact, Draghi made it clear that QE will continue, stating that it will run until or beyond the current expiry if necessary. He also claimed that it will run until inflation path is consistent with its goal, which it currently isn\u2019t close to. All things considered, today was not the event it was built up to be. However, it is clear that the ECB is working towards some significant changes to the QE program, even if that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more stimulus in the short term. Whether that takes three or six months isn\u2019t really too important. Here\u2019s a word cloud of Mario Draghi\u2019s statement, from Teneo Intelligence Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says investors go ahead of themselves this month: Lena Komileva of G+ Economics agrees: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the baton has been passed to the ECB\u2019s committee which is examining how to \u2018enhance\u2019 its QE programme. Birmingham University economics professor Tony Yates smells a rat.... European stock markets have fallen into the red, after Mario Draghi disappointed those expecting a new bout of stimulus measures. The German DAX is leading the selloff, down almost 1.4%. Traders are somewhat disappointed that the ECB didn\u2019t even discuss extending its QE programme, which runs out in six months. Draghi also didn\u2019t sound like a man close to hitting the panic button - as he repeatedly said that the ECB\u2019s measures are working well. Colin Dewar of Hargreaves Lansdown explains: In its latest, eagerly awaited policy meeting, the central bank left interest rates on hold at its record low of 0.0% as widely expected. However, during his associated press conference ECB president Mario Draghi went on to confirm an extension of its current stimulus programme was not discussed between policy makers, going against the predictions of many market analysts. Final question (hurrah!) is also about Germany. Q: Do we need much higher wages in Germany to cut the current account surplus and help other countries sell goods to German consumers? This question is \u2018absolutely right\u2019, Draghi smiles - like a teacher awarding a gold star to a bright pupil. It\u2019s possible that the low inflation rate in the eurozone has fed through to wage settlements; if so, the ECB would be very concerned. And in short: The case for higher wages is unquestionable. And with that, Draghi has left the room -- perhaps to get a strong coffee after that snoozefest of a press conference..... Q: Have you considered whether the ECB\u2019s inflation target (just below 2%), should be changed to a \u2018nominal inflation\u2019 target (ie, growth plus inflation). We didn\u2019t have that discussion yet, says Draghi, before quickly removing the \u2018yet\u2019. We didn\u2019t have that discussion, he repeats firmly. This has not been the most exciting press conference in monetary policy history... Q: Germany is on track to run a record surplus this year, so will you tell the Bundestag to do more to help their neighbours? You can\u2019t just push a button and eliminate a trade surplus if a country is naturally competitive, Draghi replies. This isn\u2019t a \u201cplanned economy\u201d. Q: But do you want Germany to boost government spending to help the recovery? Countries who have fiscal space should use it. Germany has fiscal space, Draghi replies smoothly. Asked again about government policies on structural reforms, Draghi says the G20\u2019s communique was quite powerful. That statement said: Our growth must be shored up by well-designed and coordinated policies. We are determined to use all policy tools - monetary, fiscal and structural - individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks\u2019 mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Words are cheaper than action, though, Mario..... Q: Can you rule out buying shares, or deploying helicopter money? We haven\u2019t discussed either, Draghi says, so I can\u2019t ask that question. Q: Can you reassure the public that interest rates will remain positive? The average consumer is now the main actor in the recovery, Draghi says. The recovery is based on domestic consumption, which means it is more resilient than previous recoveries based on exports. Draghi is asked about his call for all eurozone governments to \u201csubstantially step up\u201d their structural reforms. Q: Are central bankers putting more pressure on politicians? Draghi responds by reading the statement from last week\u2019s meeting of G20 leaders, which warned that monetary policy cannot fix the world economy on its own. Eurozone interest rates need to remain low for some time, Draghi says, so that the recovery isn\u2019t derailed. Interest rates have to stay low for the economic recovery to proceed, and to firm up. That, in the end, will have a positive impact on bank balance sheets too. Our policy has been extremely effective, Draghi murmurs reassuringly in his best bedside voice. If we had not acted, then various shocks - such as the UK referendum - would have had a greater impact, he argues. And the ECB president doesn\u2019t accept that his QE programme is causing serious side-effects. The transmission fo our monetary policy has never worked better, he declares -- when the ECB changes interest rates, that ripples quickly through the eurozone. Competition between banks is driving lending. Draghi also says there are no serious signs that people are hoarding cash because of negative rates. Draghi repeats that the ECB is watching financial conditions, and inflation expectations, closely - but doesn\u2019t yet see a need to act. Behind the scenes, ECB economists are examining how to enhance its QE programme - ready for a big decision in three month\u2019s time? There should be no doubt about the ECB\u2019s will, capacity or ability to take further action if needed, Draghi insists. Mario Draghi\u2019s opening statement is now online, here: Introductory statement to the press conference This is the point where he blames the Brexit vote for holding back Europe\u2019s recovery: However, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the UK referendum outcome, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment. Q: You have cut your inflation forecast again, so why not boost your stimulus programme? Draghi says that its only a small downgrade, so no need to act now. Q: Could the ECB extend its QE programme to cover equities (shares)? Draghi isn\u2019t lured into this one, says that the programme is being effective so the focus should be on implementing it. Onto questions: Q: How close are you to deciding whether to extend your quantitative easing programme, which expires in March 2017? We didn\u2019t discuss extending it, Draghi shoots back. That\u2019s a bit of a surprise... Mario Draghi is now lecturing Europe\u2019s elected politicians that they need to \u201cSubstantially Step Up\u201d their structural reform efforts. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity, he urges. But he says this kind of thing every month. Is anyone actually listening? Despite the Brexit vote, the ECB has raised its forecast for growth in 2016 from 1.6% to 1.7%. But it\u2019s trimmed its 2017 forecasts, from 1.7% to 1.6%. A fairly meaningless change, really. It has left its 2016 inflation forecast unchanged, but cut its forecasts for 2017 and 2018: Financial experts aren\u2019t impressed by Draghi\u2019s Brexit warning: Draghi then warns that the eurozone recovery will be \u201cdampened\u201d by subdued by foreign demand. And he pins some of the blame on the \u201cuncertainty\u201d following the result of the UK referendum on the European Union. The latest economic data suggests that the eurozone economy is resilient, but with downside risks, says Draghi. The ECB still expects real GDP to grow at a \u201cmoderate, steady pace\u201d, and we are watching financial market developments \u201cclosely\u201d, he says. The ECB also sees a gradual increase in inflation. Draghi begins by confirming that interest rates have been left unchanged. We continue to expect that they will stay at present or lower levels for an \u201cextended time\u201d, he says. And he also confirms that the ECB expects to run its QE programme until at least March 2017, or longer if needed, and until \u201ca sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d has been achieved (as the official statement explained). Mario Draghi has arrived for his press conference, and is being surrounded by photographers. He\u2019s now shoo\u2019d them away, and we\u2019re off! All eyes will be on Mario Draghi in 20 minutes time, when he holds a press conference to explain today\u2019s decisions. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics believes he will sound optimistic about the eurozone economy: The ECB\u2019s decision today to leave policy on hold as had been broadly expected reflects the reasonably positive tone of recent economic data, but we think that it will need to announce further policy stimulus before long. The statement that \u201cmonthly asset purchases of \u20ac80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary\u201d suggests that the Bank has not yet committed to extending the programme by another six months as we had thought that it might. To support the decision, Mr Draghi is likely to point out in the press conference starting at 13.30 BST that the recent news on the economy has been fairly encouraging. Todd Buell of the Wall Street Journal reckons that Draghi won\u2019t drop any big surprises on us, having already left the QE programme unchanged. Nordea Market\u2019s Aurelija Augulyte predicts that Draghi will urge politicians to implement structural reforms (a popular refrain at these events). TV journalist Katie Pilbeam hopes that Draghi won\u2019t leave his audience disappointed: Italian stallion?! Makes a change from Super Mario, anyway..... Frankfurt traders are disappointed by the lack of fresh stimulus measures in the ECB\u2019s statement. German bonds are selling off, pushing up the yield on the debt. And the DAX stock market index has fallen by 0.5%. Investors may have been hoping that the ECB would tweak its rules to allow it to buy more German debt. Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly says the ECB has basically copied out July\u2019s statement again: The euro has hit a two-week high against the US dollar, up 0.6% to $1.1306. It\u2019s also up 0.5% against the pound, at 84.7p That shows that some investors had hoped for a big new stimulus announcement today (although that never seemed too likely). Here\u2019s the statement from the ECB, confirming that interest rates remain on hold: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the monthly asset purchases of \u20ac80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today. The European Central bank also \u201creaffirms\u201d that it will run its quantitative easing programme until March 2017, or beyond if needed. That\u2019s not a major change of policy -- Mario Draghi had already said that stimulus would continue until inflation was close to target. Breaking: The European Central Bank has left interest rates across the eurozone unchanged at today\u2019s meeting. That means the headline rate remains at zero, and the deposit rate (levied on bank deposits left at the ECB) stays at -0.4%. That\u2019s broadly as expected, but those who were looking for new stimulus measures may be disappointed. More to follow.... The ECB could easily hold off any big decisions today, but hint that fresh stimulus measures are coming in a few months. Trader Dan Goldberg tweets: We did this joke hours ago: There are several ways that Mario Draghi could boost his existing quantitative easing scheme. Currently, the programme is buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate debt each month - but the ECB could buy more, run the scheme for longer, or tweak the rules. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets has kindly rounded most of them up for us: Extending QE Past March 2017: This seems to be the most realistic and easiest way out for now. He can extend this by another 6 months. Cutting Deposit Rate: This will make more instruments eligible for purchase, but the bond yields could move even further into negative territory. The banking sector which is already struggling could take another hit and the Euro currency may face a tailspin. Expanding Monthly QE Purchase: Only if there is enough quantity available and currently, the number of instruments eligible are scarce. Adding Other Asset Classes to QE: This is simply increasing the options on the menu and every time the market will start running dry, the perception will be that there will be another menu with new choices. Other Measures: Helicopter money, along with other unknown tools which the market is not aware of yet.Draghi certainly has something up his sleeve and could be revealed when they think they have no other options left. Another option involves the \u2018capital key\u2019 -- the rule which dictates how much capital each member provides to the ECB, based on their economic weight: Currently, the ECB uses this key to determine how much debt it buys from each country - which is why it\u2019s running out of German debt. If it ditched the capital key, it could then buy more debt from other nations and prevent QE running dry. But that would also provoke a row with opponents who fear QE is simply monetary financing.... Just 45 minutes to go until the ECB shatters the calm by announcing the results of today\u2019s meeting. But there\u2019s little chance of a shock, really -- the governing council will surely leave the main interest rate at zero. And it won\u2019t want to hurt eurozone banks by imposing even deeper negative rates -- they are already charged 0.4% on deposits left at the ECB. The euro has been rallying this morning, up around 0.5%, as traders anticipate that Draghi will disappoint those who expect fresh stimulus. Money has been flowing out of European stock markets this year, as investors have fretted about the eurozone\u2019s structural problems, the EU referendum, and the rise of populist parties. But despite the endless drama of 2016, valuations are only slightly lower than in January - and bank shares have rallied over the summer (after an earlier rout). Vincent Juvyns of JP Morgan Asset Management says the Brexit vote has only had a \u201climited\u201d impact on market sentiment so far: Sentiment indicators from July and August have been relatively undented and the feared surge in anti-EU sentiment failed to materialize in the post-Brexit Spanish elections. In fact, the outcome of the UK referendum seems to have paradoxically awakened some support in Europe for the union, both from its citizens and from its politicians, with Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Matteo Renzi agreeing further initiatives this summer to give Europe new momentum. The ECB\u2019s stimulus package is also \u201cbearing fruit\u201d, with inflation picking up recently. These price trends should continue thanks to the rebound in the oil price since the beginning of the year and the growth of monetary aggregates directly induced by monetary policy. At the same time, quantitative easing, the new targeted longer-term refinancing operations and the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme are all helping to improve the transmission of monetary policy, leading to more favourable financing conditions. So if governments do their big, and boost fiscal spending, Europe\u2019s slow recovery might actually pick up. There\u2019s a glimmer of light in the troubled Greek economy; the unemployment rate has dipped to 23.4% in June, from 23.6% in May. But youth unemployment is running at twice that level: UK electronics group Dixons Carphone has ridden the EU referendum uncertainty in style. The company has reported a 9% jump in sales in the May-to-July quarter -- suggesting consumers weren\u2019t gripped by panic after the June 23 referendum. CEO Seb James says there\u2019s no sign that Brexit has hit shoppers. \u201cWe are delivering pleasing growth in all markets and continued high levels of customer satisfaction, and thus far, continue to see no detectable impact of the Brexit vote on consumer behaviour in the UK.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s because the UK has done remarkably little, yet, about actually leaving the EU and is adopting a \u2018cards-close-to-the-chest\u2019 strategy. Europe\u2019s patience isn\u2019t inexhaustible, though, as APF\u2019s Danny Kemp explains: Germany\u2019s economy will suffer from Brexit angst next year, says the country\u2019s Institute for Economic Research (or DIW): Brexit fears will be high on the ECB\u2019s agenda today - after recent surveys showed that eurozone business growth has fallen to its lowest since January. The UK\u2019s economy appears to be performing better than many economists feared since the June referendum (so far, anyway...). But the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU is also casting a shadow over the continent. That\u2019s why Donald Tusk is urging Theresa May to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible, at Downing Street today. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains why the ECB should be concerned: There has been plenty of evidence in the last few weeks to suggest that the Eurozone, despite the various measures in place, is still struggling, with 3 month and 19 month lows in the manufacturing and services PMIs respectively alongside perpetually stagnant inflation. Draghi and co. are set to slash growth forecasts when they reveal the fruits of their labour later on; what is unclear, however, is if those downgrades will be joined some kind of extension or expansion to what is already out there. European stock markets have inched up in early trading, close to their highest levels since January. And that means there is less pressure on the ECB to launch new stimulus measures today. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics tweets that the stars aren\u2019t aligned for another boost of QE.... Draghi isn\u2019t the only Super Mario making headlines today. Nintendo\u2019 share surged by 18% overnight, after it announced it will (finally) put its iconic, pixellated plumber onto Apple mobile phones. The new game is called \u201cSuper Mario Run\u201d - not to be confused with \u201cSuper Mario Bank Run\u201d, which is what we\u2019ll get if the eurozone crisis really explodes.... London\u2019s stock market has opened higher this morning, as City investors wonder if Mario Draghi will promise more stimulus measures. The FTSE 100 has gained 32 points, or 0.5%, to 687. It is being driven by UK software firm Micro Focus, which has soared by a blistering 21% to a new record high after agreeing a deal to buy Hewlett-Packard\u2019s software business. It\u2019s refreshing to see a British firm launching a takeover bid, rather than being acquired. Especially given the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: It\u2019s a confident move \u2013 it would be the biggest acquisition by a British company of a foreign tech firm and comes in the face of a massive drop in the value of the pound that has made UK firms the target of overseas bidders.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about the deal: European Central Bank policymakers are probably split over whether to do even more quantitative easing. Hawkish members of the governing council, such as Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann, might fight efforts to buy even more government and corporate debt. The FT\u2019s Claire Jones explains the situation: If QE continues much past the spring, the council will have to remove restrictions such as the minus 0.4 per cent floor that limits the purchase of the most expensive sovereign debt Or it could drop the commitment to buy bonds of member states according to the size of their economies. But changing either risks reviving spats between the governing council\u2019s hawks and doves. More here: Four things to watch for at the ECB meeting And here: The European Central Bank will probably warn today that the Brexit vote will hit the eurozone economy, according to RBC Capital Markets. They write: Our economists look for the 2017 growth estimate to be lowered as the UK referendum is factored in, and that should have a knock on-effect on inflation. So while consensus might not be looking for an extension to QE today, that may understate the expectations for today\u2019s press conference. In other words, Draghi might surprise the City with some new stimulus measures in this afternoon\u2019s press conference. Hope Mario Draghi has a new pencil case for the autumn term too..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The thermometers in Frankfurt are heading towards 27 degrees today - not bad for mid-September. And the temperature is rising inside the European Central Bank too, as policymakers ponder the state of the eurozone economy. The ECB is holding its latest monetary policy meeting today, and will be considering whether it should unleash more stimulus on the eurozone. It will also publish new growth and inflation forecasts for the first time since Britain voted to leave the EU in June. Economists expect the euro area headline interest rate to remain unchanged at zero, with banks continuing to be charged 0.4% to leave cash at the eurozone central bank\u2019s vaults. But, there\u2019s a chance that the ECB could adjust its quantitative easing programme, in a new attempt to stimulate growth and ward off a slump. With Brexit fears gripping Europe, Greece\u2019s bailout programme stalling (again), and political instability rife, you can imagine that the ECB is getting nervous about the situation But what could it do?..... The ECB could extend the programme\u2019s duration beyond March 2017, perhaps by 6 months. That would allow it to pump more money into the system. Or it could tweak its parameters, giving itself the freedom to buy a wider range of debt. The ECB is already buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate debt each month, helping to drive borrowing costs (yields) down to record lows. Some analysts fear that the ECB could actually run out of bonds to snaffle through QE unless it does something soon. Salman Ahmed, Chief Investment Strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, predicts fireworks from Mario Draghi. We expect the ECB to switch back into easing mode after the summer break. We believe there is a strong possibility that the duration of the buying program will be extended to September 2017 or beyond. This will be supplemented by some technical adjustments to the modalities of the easing program to relieve the constraints on buying more assets, especially, the shortage of German bonds. The ECB is also in the spotlight because eurozone governments aren\u2019t pulling their weight, leaving Draghi to pull the levers of monetary policy with increased vigour. Or as Ahmed puts it: This switch back to easing is driven by the persistent anaemic inflation dynamics in the single currency union and the growing realisation that monetary policy stimulus remains the only major source of support to the economy. Without further action, there is a strong risk of tightening of financial conditions to the detriment of the ongoing gentle recovery. Here\u2019s the key timings: The interest rate decision will be announced at 12.45pm BST (1.45pm Frankfurt). ECB chief Mario Draghi will then address the press 45 minutes later. We\u2019ll cover the build up, the decision, and Draghi\u2019s press conference, along with other key events through the day.....",

While Draghi\u2019s dovish rhetoric may have opened doors for an extension to bond buying program beyond March 2017, the visible disappointment could propel the Euro higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d17720e4b013613fffb4e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:37:48.259Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Markets should be patient, as the European Central Bank will surely boost its QE programme once its staff have worked out the best method.</strong></p> <p>So argues Craig Erlam, market analyst at City firm OANDA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The ECB may not have announced any more policy easing today, or even indicated that further stimulus is likely in the coming months, but Mario Draghi did a fine job in talking up bond yields in the euro area. Perhaps a sly attempt to free up more assets eligible for purchase under the current quantitative easing structure.</p> <p> There were two main takeaways from today\u2019s ECB decision and press conference. The first is that inflation and growth forecasts were lowered but only marginally reflecting the negative, albeit less so than previously expected, impact of the Brexit vote. The other is that the committee has been given a full mandate to redesign QE. In other words, the central bank is approaching the point at which it will no longer be possible to carry out QE in its current form, but it is looking at ways to overcome it.</p> <p> That would explain why they did not announce an extension to the QE program beyond March 2017 today because they must first decide how the program will be adapted. That is not to say it won\u2019t be. In fact, Draghi made it clear that QE will continue, stating that it will run until or beyond the current expiry if necessary. He also claimed that it will run until inflation path is consistent with its goal, which it currently isn\u2019t close to.</p> <p> All things considered, today was not the event it was built up to be. However, it is clear that the ECB is working towards some significant changes to the QE program, even if that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more stimulus in the short term. Whether that takes three or six months isn\u2019t really too important.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d17697e4b013613fffb4e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:34:25.312Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a word cloud of Mario Draghi\u2019s statement, from Teneo Intelligence</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b8af86c9b7185ee9003a07bfd8a74aef85b27ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b8af86c9b7185ee9003a07bfd8a74aef85b27ca/0_0_622_388/500.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d16adce4b013613fffb4a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:20:26.612Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi's press conference: instant reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says investors go ahead of themselves this month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/drdanmclaughlin/status/773884435590701058\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Market had talked itself into belief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb\">@ecb</a>  would act today so inaction a wake up call.

      "bodyText": "Large companies should publish their tax returns and whistleblowers who expose financial wrongdoing must have protection under the law, a Labour party-commissioned report into reforming tax collection has proposed. Responding to growing concern about repeated failures by HM Revenue and Customs to tackle avoidance by multinationals and wealthy individuals, the shadow chancellor published proposals on Thursday for overhauling the tax agency. John McDonnell said that HMRC was now in \u201cdisarray\u201d due to staff cuts. \u201cWith the appropriate levels of investment \u2026 we think we could achieve a fair and just taxation system, which would overcome some of the issues we now have for investment in our public services.\u201d The report was produced by a panel of 14 experts and will inform official Labour proposals expected in spring 2017. It recommends an independent supervisory board for HMRC, consisting of stakeholders appointed by the chancellor, to \u201cact as a bulwark against corporate capture and inertia\u201d. HMRC\u2019s board is dominated by individuals previously connected with major corporations and large accountancy firms known for marketing avoidance schemes, the panel of experts said. It has no members representing small businesses, ordinary taxpayers, HMRC\u2019s own staff, or claimants of benefits. The new supervisory board would provide a point of contact for whistleblowers wanting to expose tax cheats. It would also support policies to protect the jobs and income of whistleblowers, who would get broader protection under the law. There is also a recommendation that whistleblowers should receive \u201ca possible share of the taxes and penalties recovered as a direct result of the information provided by them\u201d. The panel was led by Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex, and included representatives from campaign groups such as the Tax Justice Network and the High Pay Centre. Sikka writes in the Guardian on Thursday that HMRC has been \u201cthwarted\u201d by lack of resources and is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d. He said: \u201cFor 100 years we have been publishing company accounts. Tax information is an important part of corporate governance. We feel this information should be publicly available.\u201d Sikka proposes that \u201call large companies\u201d must make their tax returns public by filing them alongside their yearly accounts. The documents, which would be free to access online through the Companies House database, would include all related documents such as advice from QCs and accountancy firms recommending particular avoidance schemes. Tribunal cases against tax cheats should be handled more quickly \u2013 many tax cases can take a decade to resolve and the first-tier tribunals have a backlog of 30,000 cases waiting to be heard. It recommends the recruitment of more judges, focused on tax matters. HMRC is under fire for failing to bring to account wealthy individuals and large corporations. Its response to a series of high-profile scandals, including the revelations about HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank and the sweetheart deals negotiated by multinationals with Luxembourg, has been muted. Of the 3,600 potential wealthy UK taxpayers exposed by the HSBC Files, only one has been prosecuted by HMRC. In January, the agency said it had abandoned its criminal investigation into the bank\u2019s alleged collusion in illegal activities. HMRC bosses have told parliament that the agency investigates just 35 wealthy individuals a year. HMRC claims to have only 70 staff examining data released by the Panama Papers on more than 300,000 offshore companies. \u201cThis may well suffer the same fate as the HSBC inquiry,\u201d the Labour report warns. A spokesman for the tax office said: \u201cWe welcome any debate about how HMRC can operate more effectively, but expect a proper acknowledgment that HMRC achieved another year of record-breaking performance in collecting tax and securing compliance yield, while continuing to deliver efficiencies. \u201cLast year we collected \u00a3536.8bn in tax and duties \u2013 \u00a319bn more than the year before.\u201d The panel of experts want greater resources for the tax agency. HMRC has lost more than one-third of its staff since 2005, with further cuts planned. Unions are fighting plans to replace 170 local offices with 13 regional centres. Responding to the proposals, Lorna Merry, president of the HMRC group at the Public and Commercial Services Union, warned that office closures would leave the agency \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d valuable experienced staff, including investigators and minimum wage inspectors. She said: \u201cThis is a really important piece of work. Someone needs to look hard at HMRC and what its for and who its for. The issues of small businesses and ordinary taxpayers are being ignored.\u201d",

Tax information is an important part of corporate governance. We feel this information should be publicly available.\u201d</p> <p>Sikka proposes that \u201call large companies\u201d must make their tax returns public by filing them alongside their yearly accounts. The documents, which would be free to access online through the Companies House database, would include all related documents such as advice from QCs and accountancy firms recommending particular avoidance schemes.</p> <p>Tribunal cases against tax cheats should be handled more quickly \u2013 many tax cases can take a decade to resolve and the first-tier tribunals have a backlog of 30,000 cases waiting to be heard. It recommends the recruitment of more judges, focused on tax matters.</p> <p>HMRC is under fire for failing to bring to account wealthy individuals and large corporations. Its response to a series of high-profile scandals, including the revelations about HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank and the sweetheart deals negotiated by multinationals with Luxembourg, has been muted. Of the 3,600 potential wealthy UK taxpayers exposed by the HSBC Files, only one has been prosecuted by HMRC. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In January, the agency said it had abandoned its criminal investigation into the bank\u2019s alleged collusion in illegal activities. HMRC bosses have told parliament that the agency investigates just 35 wealthy individuals a year.</p> <p>HMRC claims to have only 70 staff examining data released by the Panama Papers on more than 300,000 offshore companies. \u201cThis may well suffer the same fate as the HSBC inquiry,\u201d the Labour report warns.</p> <p>A spokesman for the tax office said: \u201cWe welcome any debate about how HMRC can operate more effectively, but expect a proper acknowledgment that HMRC achieved another year of record-breaking performance in collecting tax and securing compliance yield, while continuing to deliver efficiencies.</p> <p>\u201cLast year we collected \u00a3536.8bn in tax and duties \u2013 \u00a319bn more than the year before.\u201d<br></p> <p>The panel of experts want greater resources for the tax agency. HMRC has lost more than one-third of its staff since 2005, with further cuts planned. Unions are fighting plans to replace 170 local offices with 13 regional centres.</p> <p>Responding to the proposals, Lorna Merry, president of the HMRC group at the Public and Commercial Services Union, warned that office closures would leave the agency \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d valuable experienced staff, including investigators and minimum wage inspectors. </p> <p>She said: \u201cThis is a really important piece of work.

The Communication Workers Union, which claimed the Post Office was now at \u201ccrisis point\u201d, said its members will take action on 15 September following the vote for industrial action last month. The government-owned service plans to transfer about 60 of its 300 larger outlets to the private sector, which along with other cost-cutting proposals, will lead to the loss of around 2,000 of its 6,600-strong workforce in crown branches, back-office functions and its cash handling business. In a ballot in August, 83% of members who voted were backed strike action. The strike vote applies to crown branches, which are directly managed by the Post Office but represent only 300 of the 11,600 branches in the UK. The majority of Post Office branches are operated by independent retailers. The Post Office said that it will work to \u201cminimise any disruption to customers in the 300 crown branches\u201d. It added that while the Post Office\u2019s financial position was improving, it remained loss-making. Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said: \u201cThe Post Office is relentlessly pursuing a programme of cuts that will mean a further 2,000 job losses, staff being left tens of thousands of pounds worse off in retirement and the privatisation of its flagship branches.

Amid signs that the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is having little immediate impact on the eurozone economy, the ECB held the single currency area\u2019s main interest rate at zero. But ECB president Mario Draghi warned that uncertainty stemming from the vote for Brexit was among the factors dampening the eurozone\u2019s growth and he unveiled a slightly weaker economic outlook for the bloc. The Frankfurt-based ECB also decided to continue to buy \u20ac80bn (\u00a368bn) of bonds a month under its quantitative easing (QE) programme. But it advised markets that the scheme would likely come to an end in just six months. The statement that QE would run until March 2017, \u201cor beyond, if necessary\u201d, disappointed those investors who had hoped for a more explicit extension of QE. Draghi repeated recent assertions that the ECB stands ready to pump more stimulus into the economy as needed to get inflation back up to its target of below, but close to, 2%. He said interest rates were expected \u201cto remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time\u201d. Eurozone inflation stands at 0.2%. Eurozone interest rates are already at a record low after the ECB used its March meeting to launch an unprecedented package of growth-bolstering measures. It cut borrowing costs, expanded its QE programme, and reduced a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory. Draghi used his latest news conference on Thursday to insist that his support package was \u201ceffective\u201d while promising there was more ammunition left to deploy if inflation refuses to budge upwards. \u201cIf warranted, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate,\u201d he said. Draghi also said the ECB was looking at ways to ensure \u201ca smooth implementation\u201d of its QE scheme, by which it electronically creates money to buy bonds. However, he said policymakers had not discussed expanding the scheme to buy stocks, and nor had they mulled \u201chelicopter money\u201d, under which central banks print money so that finance ministries can hand it out to citizens or spend it on big infrastructure projects. The ECB\u2019s outlook for eurozone growth was slightly more pessimistic than when forecasts were last published in June. It now expects GDP to expand by 1.7% this year, compared with 1.6% previously. But for both 2017 and 2018 the growth forecast was trimmed to 1.6% from 1.7%. The UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU was mentioned only briefly, with Draghi commenting: \u201cThe economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the UK referendum outcome, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.\u201d In a fresh dig at politicians, Draghi said that to reap the full benefits from the ECB\u2019s monetary policy measures, \u201cother policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.\u201d He said that changes to how economies work \u201cneed to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area\u201d.",

John Lewis said sales of wireless headphones were currently 60% higher than last week after Apple\u2019s announcement on Wednesday. Apple\u2019s decision to scrap the traditional headphone socket has caused anger on social media and among analysts. Removing the jack means iPhone users must buy wireless headphones or use an adaptor to connect wired headphones to the battery port. The company will sell its own wireless headphones, called AirPods, but these will cost \u00a3119. Wireless headphones have been met with a mixed reaction from consumers. Although they are easy to use and comfortable, there have been questions about the sound quality and the rechargeable battery. Some models, such as the Bose SoundSport, have been dogged by technical problems. Nonetheless, retailers expect the market to boom as the technology improves. Katrina Mills, an audio buyer at John Lewis, said: \u201cWednesday\u2019s announcement will drive the biggest sales in wireless headphones yet. Ahead of the news, we had already seen an increased demand for wireless headphones, with noise cancelling functionality and sport models proving popular.\u201d Sales of Bose headphones were up 260% on the same period last year, John Lewis said. Other popular brands included Sony, Sennheiser, Bang &amp; Olufsen and Beats, which is owned by Apple.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s largest technology firms has announced an $8.8bn (\u00a36.6bn) deal to buy part of Hewlett-Packard\u2019s business and create one of the world\u2019s leading software companies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with Berkshire-based Micro Focus International. Micro Focus said the deal represented a rare opportunity to significantly increase the size of the company. The newly enlarged business will have annual revenues of about $4.5bn. It is one of the largest takeover deals by a British company in recent years, and the executive chairman of Micro Focus, Kevin Loosemore, said the tie-up marked a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d. \u201cThe merger will create one of the world\u2019s largest infrastructure software companies with leading positions across a number of key products. It represents a compelling opportunity to create significant value for both companies\u2019 shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combination will give customers more choice as they seek to maximize the value of existing IT assets, leveraging their business logic and data along with next-generation technologies to innovate in new ways with the lowest possible risk.\u201d Loosemore sees the deal as another opportunity to profit from managing old software. Companies including banks and airlines pay Micro Focus to extend the life of the computers they use to run their businesses, for example to manage data. This allows the companies to avoid spending on newer computer systems. Loosemore said there would be some job losses as a result of the deal. \u201cOver time we will probably see some reductions as we look for efficiencies in the business. We tend to spend a lot of time planning integrations but over the two- to three-year period there will probably be some reductions.\u201d The deal would generate better returns for shareholders and improved earnings per share by the end of the first full financial year, the companies said. The tie-up will put assets formerly owned by UK software group Autonomy back into British hands. HPE acquired part of its software portfolio through the $11bn purchase of Autonomy in 2011 \u2013 a deal that later descended into acrimony. The takeover was supposed to form the central part of HP\u2019s move into software, but HPE later wrote off three-quarters of the company\u2019s value, accusing Autonomy executives of financial mismanagement \u2013 which they deny. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said the deal was a confident move by Micro Focus, swimming against the tide of UK companies being snapped up by overseas buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s a big scalp for the FTSE 100 group, which has been on a buying spree of late.\u201d Referring to the recent acquisition of one of Britain\u2019s most prized tech companies, chip designer Arm, to a Japanese firm, he added: \u201cAfter Arm Holdings was sold to SoftBank, it\u2019s a sign that the UK tech sector is still capable of making deals in the other direction,\u201d he said. \u201c[The HPE deal] would be the biggest acquisition by a British company of a foreign tech firm, and comes in the face of a massive drop in the value of the pound that has made UK firms the target of overseas bidders.\u201d Loosemore said he would be keen to see a growing technology scene in the UK but it was not something the company was focused on. Under the terms of the deal, Micro Focus will pay $2.5bn in cash to HPE, while HPE shareholders will own 50.1% of the combined company, which will operate under the name Micro Focus and be run by its executives. HP said it would pay $700m in one-off costs related to the separation of the assets. Micro Focus was founded in 1976 and is headquartered in Newbury. It employs more than 4,500 people in more than 80 global locations, with about 20,000 customers worldwide. HPE has more than 50,000 customers. For more than a decade, about half of Micro Focus\u2019s business has been in the US. It employs just 500 people in the UK. However, Loosemore said the company was still committed to Britain. \u201cWe\u2019re totally committed to the UK. It\u2019s a great place to run a business from and I don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t do it.\u201d Meg Whitman, HPE chief executive, said: \u201cWith today\u2019s announcement we are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash-flow company well positioned for our customers and for the future. \u201cWe believe the software assets that will be a part of this combination will bring better value to both our customers and shareholders as part of a more focused software company committed to developing these businesses on a standalone basis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dixons Carphone has reported no evidence of a knock to consumer confidence after the UK vote to leave the EU, echoing industry surveys pointing to a robust mood among shoppers. The electrical retailer, formed from a merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in 2014, said revenue in the three months to the end of July was up 9% compared with the same period last year. Sebastian James, the chief executive, said it was another very good quarter for Dixons Carphone. \u201cWe are delivering pleasing growth in all markets and continued high levels of customer satisfaction, and thus far, continue to see no detectable impact of the Brexit vote on consumer behaviour in the UK,\u201d he said. It is the latest evidence that UK consumers have weathered the economic and political uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. Retail sales have risen, consumer confidence has rebounded after an initial blip, and Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders have reported business as usual, saying there is little sign of a lasting post-referendum slump. In the trading update for its first quarter, Dixons Carphone reported a 4% increase in UK and Ireland revenues on a like-for-like basis \u2013 stripping out sales in shops open for less than a year. The company runs 455 stores in the UK. Its business in southern Europe notched up the biggest rise in like-for-like revenue, up 13%. Dixons Carphone said the increase was driven by strong growth in Greece. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the retailer stood to benefit from product launches such as the new iPhone. \u201cThe group will be rubbing its hands together after Wednesday\u2019s launch of the iPhone 7, and the introduction of wireless headphones opens up a whole new market. \u201cDixons Carphone\u2019s robust revenue growth is impressive, all the more so given macroeconomic headwinds in its core UK, Nordic and southern European markets. The group\u2019s market share is increasing across the board, and a potentially lucrative expansion into the US market is just kicking off.\u201d The retailer announced in January that it would close 134 shops this year as it merged its remaining Currys and PC World shops and added a Carphone Warehouse department to each of the combined stores. Dixons Carphone said no employees would lose their jobs and staff would be offered positions at a merged store near their current workplace.",

      "bodyText": "The release of the latest GDP figures brought good news. As expected, the economy grew strongly and rather more unexpectedly, the national income also took a sharp jump. But rather than any great investment or government initiative, this jump was due to a large revision by the Bureau of Statistics \u2013 and it is a revision that certainly was not observed among workers, whose wages and hours worked continued to stagnate. For the past few years, as the economy transitioned out of the mining boom, economists and policy makers have been worried about the lack of income growth. The ABS\u2019s measure of economic wellbeing, \u201creal net national disposable income,\u201d had declined for six straight quarters from September 2014. In March, the run of declines ended with a laughably small increase of 0.03%, and the annual growth was still falling by 1.1%. Well, worry no more! In the latest figures released on Wednesday, the ABS revised the figures, taking into account a change in the calculation of \u201cprimary income credits from non-residents.\u201d The net result was that in March the ABS found $4.8bn in income down the back of the couch that we didn\u2019t know about: It meant that instead of falling by 1.1% in March, Australia\u2019s economic wellbeing was actually growing by 0.4% and in June the growth is now up to 2.1% \u2013 the best for four years: It\u2019s a fairly massive revision \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t leave you with a lot of confidence. It isn\u2019t helped by some oddities in the latest seasonally adjusted GDP figures. The figures estimated that Australia\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% off the back of a surge in public investment and spending, which more than made up for a fall in net exports and private investment. Praise be to government spending! While the figures demonstrate the impact of public spending they also highlight the dangers of relying on seasonally adjusted figures, because they really look a tad fishy when subjected to close inspection. In seasonally adjusted terms, public investment contributed 0.65% points to quarterly growth \u2013 that is larger than the actual 0.5% growth in the overall economy. In effect if you took away that government investment, the economy would have gone backwards: But while around a fifth of that public investment came from the federal government, mostly via the purchase of Chinook helicopters, the big chunk came from the states and local government \u2013 especially Victoria and Western Australia. Without getting too deeply into the weeds, in Victoria, state and local government investment apparently grew in the June quarter by 59.6% \u2013 the biggest jump on record: In Western Australia, the increase was 43.8% \u2013 another record. Two states with record public investment growth in the same month? Sorry, I don\u2019t buy it. So let us instead look at the trend figures, which at least make a bit more sense. And in trend terms the news was still good \u2013 the economy grew by 0.7% in the June quarter (actually better than the seasonally adjusted figure) and by 3.1% over the past year \u2013 the best annual growth since September 2012: The story is also good on the nominal GDP front \u2013 although that is a relative term \u2013 the 2.8% annual growth is the best since June 2014, but remains pathetically below the 25-year average of 5.7%. And while the trend is going in the right direction, it\u2019s still a long way from achieving the 4.5% growth estimated for 2016-17 in the May budget. In trend terms, the biggest driver of growth in the quarter is household consumption. Public investment slips back to being the fourth most important, and net exports goes from being a negative to a positive: As I have noted in the past, one of the problems with being dependent upon exports for economic growth is that net exports (exports minus imports) jump around a bit in the seasonally adjusted terms. At 1.7 percentage points, net exports contributed just half of total growth in the past year. The contribution of household spending also remains a big driver \u2013 almost as important as net exports \u2013 but in June, household consumption grew by just 0.6% in trend terms, the smallest increase for three years. Such a slowing replicates the weak retail trade figures out last week: The annual growth of household spending remains fairly stable but a look at what is driving the growth suggests we\u2019re not spending so much due to a joy in our step, but because the bills need to be paid. While the big jump in spending over the past year was for clothing at 7.2%, it was not the biggest contributor to the growth in our spending. That title goes to rent and other dwelling services, followed by insurance and financial services, which together accounted for nearly a third of all our increase in spending. It\u2019s not all bad though \u2013 our spending on recreation and culture was up a solid 3.5% and was the fourth biggest contributor to the growth of spending: We are still purchasing houses at a strong clip, but even that does seem to be coming off the boil a bit: One thing that also remains largely unchanged is the weak growth in labour costs and the incomes going to employees. In the past year, the cost of labour actually fell, and the overall compensation of employees grew at just 3.2% \u2013 reflecting the record low wages growth and a fall in the number of hours worked: But the drop in hours worked combined with an increase in GDP meant there was a strong jump in labour productivity, and it continued the now more than four-year run of productivity growth: To an extent, the GDP figures are a bit of \u201csame old story\u201d. The overall growth is good \u2013 3.1% is something you\u2019d never turn down. But the growth remains largely off the back of exports from low labour-intensive industries and also from increased spending in areas like rent and insurance that most people would not consider as being all that wonderful \u2013 especially at a time when wages are flat-lining. We will have to wait to see if the new-found jump in national income translates into something employees also come to experience.",
