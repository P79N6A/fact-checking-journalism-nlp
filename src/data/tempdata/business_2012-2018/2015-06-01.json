      "bodyText": "PS: Analysts at Macropolis, the respected Greek news and analysis site, are hopeful that creditors have made progress tonight: Greece\u2019s negotiations with its lenders have entered the final stretch after creditors met in Berlin on Monday night to discuss the details of the offer that will be put to Athens in a bid to conclude the process and pave the way for the release of \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funding So do come back in the morning to find out if they\u2019re right. We don\u2019t know, yet, exactly what happened in the Berlin chancellery over the last few hours; hopefully details will emerge in the morning. But as things stand, Greece\u2019s creditors certainly haven\u2019t revealed details of a new offer for Athens, after talking for more than two hours. The official line Berlin is that Merkel, Draghi, Lagarde, Hollande and Juncker are determined to work hard, and work with Greece, to resolve the crisis that has been dominating the eurozone for most of 2015. As Germany\u2019s spokesman put it: \u201cThey agreed that work must continue with real intensity,\u201d \u201cThe participants in the talks were in close contact in recent days and want this to remain the case in the coming days both among themselves and of course with the Greek government.\u201d Tonight\u2019s talks were an opportunity for Greece\u2019s creditors to hammer out their disagreements, so they could present Alexis Tsipras with a new offer. Perhaps it failed, or perhaps we\u2019re going to learn more on Tuesday? The very fact Angela Merkel called in Draghi and Lagarde suggests that it will indeed take top-level diplomacy to resolve the deadlock. Friday\u2019s deadline to hand \u20ac300m to the IMF hasn\u2019t evaporated, nor has the fact Greece\u2019s bailout programme expires on June 30. It\u2019s now Tuesday in Britain, Germany and Greece already... doesn\u2019t time fly! So I think we\u2019ll wrap up. We\u2019ll be back in a few hours with a new liveblog covering the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Some photos of Greece\u2019s creditors ending their meeting tonight, and leaving the chancellery, just arrived (thanks Reuters!) Hopes of a major breakthrough tonight in Berlin have been dented, following those comments from the German spokesman as the meeting broke up. Newsflash from Germany: Creditors have agreed that there must be \u201cintensive work\u201d on Greece, a spokesman says. And Merkel, Draghi, Lagarde, Hollande and Juncker will stay in close contact with each other, and with Greece, in the days ahead. That does not sounds like a breakthrough.... Here\u2019s the snaps off Reuters: 01-Jun-2015 23:25:10 - GERMAN GOVT SPOKESMAN - MERKEL, HOLLANDE, JUNCKER, LAGARDE AND DRAGHI AGREED ON NEED FOR INTENSIVE WORK ON GREECE 1-Jun-2015 23:26:06 - GERMAN GOVT SPOKESMAN -PARTICIPANTS AT TALKS WILL REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT IN COMING DAYS, INCLUDING WITH GREEK GOVT Financial news service RANsquawk is reporting that the Berlin meeting has just concluded.... The latest word from Berlin is that creditors don\u2019t plan to hit Greece with a \u2018final ultimatum\u2019, but will craft the outlines of a deal. Whether Athens sees it the same way is another matter..... The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports that the Berlin meeting includes paperwork showing where compromises might be made: This meeting in Berlin was meant to be focused on the worthy topic of boosting Europe\u2019s economy through more investment. But it\u2019s turned into so much more, once Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi arrived unexpectedly to discuss the Greek crisis. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports: The German chancellor Angela Merkel moved to try to defuse Greece\u2019s financial and European crisis late on Monday, converting a routine long-scheduled meeting with French and EU leaders into a mini-summit on Greece that was said to be preparing a final response to Athens\u2019 intractable debt dilemmas. Merkel met France\u2019s president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for what was billed as a session on how to boost investment in the EU. But they were joined by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, in what turned into a late-night session on Greece. Athens is facing insolvency and payments of \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) to the IMF within the next few weeks, with the first payment of \u20ac305m due by Friday. Now it appears that the Greek drama is shifting up a gear, heading for its denouement, after five months of negotiations between the Greeks and its eurozone/IMF creditors going nowhere. Merkel\u2019s staff let it be known that the chancellor wanted the mini-summit in Berlin to deliver a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to Athens, German public television reported. \u201cThe creditors want to agree a common position tonight,\u201d ZDF television said. Merkel wanted the deal sealed before a meeting this weekend in Germany of the G7 countries. Whether the terms of the proposed resolution represented an ultimatum to Greece was unclear. Tonight\u2019s emergency meeting shows that Greece\u2019s creditors are losing patience, after months of crunch meetings, tough negotiations and scarce progress: So says the WSJ tonight, which adds: Officials from European institutions and the International Monetary Fund sent a draft text on the economic overhauls that Greece needs to implement to unlock bailout financing to a meeting in Berlin of key European leaders, according to people familiar with the matter. Over in Athens, everyone is watching and waiting to see how this gripping crisis develops. Helena Smith our correspondent reports: Excluded from talks that he had wanted to attend, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been relegated to the sidelines tonight - forced by circumstance into the role of spectator at what may well be the make-or-break meeting that decides the fate of his debt-stricken country. Earlier on Monday a finance ministry official had told me: \u201cWe are on the brink. We know something is going to happen, we just don\u2019t know what.\u201d This, it seems, is it. Going into a mini meeting of senior cabinet officials held at the prime minister\u2019s office tonight, the man heading Greece\u2019s negotiation team, deputy foreign minister, Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters: \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to be worried.\u201d No statements were made when the meeting ended an hour ago. The leftist-led government is desperate to douse any concerns over a run on banks. Describing tonight\u2019s Berlin talks, the daily newspaper Ethnos said it was likely that the Greek prime minister would be presented with a proposal offering the only \u201crealistic solution\u201d to avert bankruptcy and remain in the euro zone. The solution was likely to be presented in the form of an ultimatum, the newspaper said. However, sources are suggesting that they do not expect a statement to be made by Greece\u2019s creditors until Tuesday. This may, of course, be wishful thinking.... The Financial Times has just published a handy explanation of the differences that have emerged between Greece\u2019s creditors in recent weeks, prompting tonight\u2019s emergency mini-summit. The IMF has been holding to a tough line, out of respect for its own lending rules and regard for pressure from countries in other parts of the world, which say Athens has already enjoyed very favourable treatment. The European Commission has argued for more generous terms for Athens because it sets a high priority on keeping the eurozone intact \u2014 a key symbol of EU unity. The ECB, too, wants to keep the common currency together but is also afraid of damaging its credibility by overextending its role as a central bank. . And if Angela Merkel, Europe\u2019s most powerful politician, decides that Greece needs more financial aid, that cash would probably come from the eurozone not the IMF, the FT adds. Tonight\u2019s meeting on Greece is now well underway, between Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, Jean-Claude Juncker, Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde. One official told Reuters that: \u201cThey will discuss how to proceed and and whether they should make a new offer for an agreement to (Greek Prime Minister Alexis) Tsipras.\u201d Tonight\u2019s meeting in Berlin is missing one crucial actor - Alexis Tsipras himself, the left-wing leader who swept to power in January on a promise to end austerity and break away from the last five years. Tsipras had hoped to reach a political agreement over Greece, but tonight\u2019s meeting suggests he\u2019s going to get an ultimatum from creditors. And that might not be compatible with his own political mandate, so whatever emerges from Berlin probably won\u2019t be the end of this story. It\u2019s now midnight in Athens, but prime minister Tsipras and his top team are going nowhere yet -- they\u2019re watching events in Berlin like the rest of us Here\u2019s another photo of \u201cSuper Mario\u201d Draghi being whisked into tonight\u2019s meeting in Berlin: With thanks to Patrick Donahue, Bloomberg\u2019s political correspondent in Berlin. It\u2019s looking like quite a night.... And here\u2019s the German chancellery tonight, where the heads of the EC, the ECB, the IMF, Germany and France are trying to devise an offer to Greece to keep it in the euro and calm the crisis. A photo of Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, arriving at tonight\u2019s talks in Berlin has just arrived: (OK, it\u2019s not the best picture of Draghi ever, but he\u2019s third from the left) Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reckons that tonight\u2019s talks in Berlin could go late into the night (it\u2019s currently 10.15pm there) in a bid to break the deadlock over Greece. Tonight\u2019s cabinet meeting in Athens has ended, but the top ministers are now hanging around waiting for news from Berlin..... Channel Four\u2019s Paul Mason has heard that Greece wants the European Central Bank to provide more liquidity to its banking sector, as part of any deal. Greek banks have been dependent on emergency liquidity for months, ever since the ECB decided it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral to guarantee loans (a decision that enraged Athens) If you\u2019ve been following this crisis closely, you\u2019ll already know that June is an absolutely crunch month for Greece. But other readers might find this helpful: Athens owes \u20ac305m to the International Monetary Fund on Friday, and it may struggle to find the funds. It could bundle the payment in with other looming IMF bills, which total \u20ac1.6bn this month. Greece is still \u2018owed\u2019 \u20ac7.2bn in bailout loans, but they are frozen while the two sides have argued , largely fruitlessly, about a new bailout programme to replace the original one agreed in 2012. Creditors agreed a four-month extension in late February, which expires on 30 June. Without a deal, Greece could simply plough into July without its last tranche of bailout funds. It then faces billions of euros of extra repayments this summer, including \u20ac6.7bn to the European Central Bank. That\u2019s why economists think Greece needs to agree a third \u2018programme\u2019 (a bailout) soon. But that can\u2019t be discussed while the current programme is mired in deadlock. Thus tonight\u2019s talks in Berlin to decide a common position on Greece, at the highest level. Greek officials are hoping for positive news from Berlin: Rumours are swirling that Athens is about to get a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 offer. RadioRadicale\u2019s Brussels correspondent, David Carretta, tweets the latest word: Several analysts and commentators are talking about the Greek crisis entering its \u201cendgame\u201d tonight, after four months of deadlock. Greek radio journalist Giannis Papageorgiou points out that Christine Lagarde has lingered on in Germany after last week\u2019s G7 meeting of central bankers and finance chiefs, ready for tonight\u2019s meeting. (that\u2019s Poul Thomsen, the IMF\u2019s European director and former joint head of the Troika delegation in Athens) Treat with caution: Germany\u2019s Die Welt is reporting that Greece might be prepared to compromise on one of its \u2018red lines\u2019, pension reforms. They say that PM Alexis Tsipras has told creditors that he \u201cwants to talk\u201d about pension cuts and a later retirement age. That\u2019s not the same as a concrete proposal, though. More here Alexis Tsipras has been pushing for a political deal for weeks, arguing that technical talks between officials can never resolve this crisis. Tonight\u2019s talks between the Big Five in Berlin suggest he\u2019s getting his wish, tweets our Europe editor Ian Traynor. But can Tsipras possibly get an offer that\u2019s acceptable to enough of his party? Earlier today, hope was building in Greece that a temporary deal could be reached. One well-placed insider told my colleague Helena Smith: \u201cWe are very close to the edge of the cliff, we are on the brink but we are not sure what is going to happen - yet.\u201d Reuters is also reporting that Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde will meet Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Jean-Claude Juncker in Berlin tonight. So the leaders of Greece\u2019s three Institutions (the former Troika) are gathered in one place to discuss the crisis, along with the leaders of the two most powerful countries in the eurozone. This might just be a \u2018moment\u2019 in the crisis. Over to Reuters: Draghi, Lagarde joining Berlin meeting on Greece. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and IMF chief Christine Lagarde will join the leaders of Germany, France, and the European Commission for talks on Monday evening in Berlin on Greece, European Union officials said. The goal of the meeting was to reach a joint position on how to negotiate with Greece, the officials said. Athens and its creditors from the euro zone countries and the International Monetary Fund are trying to hammer out a deal that would prevent the country from defaulting on its debt and potentially leaving the euro zone. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave brief statements before meeting to discuss the digital economy. They made no mention of Greece. [end] The MNI newswire is reporting that a statement might be released following tonight\u2019s meeting in Berlin. Greek media are also reporting that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting with some of his cabinet tonight: Hello again. An interesting development tonight to flag up. Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Jean-Claude Juncker have been meeting in Berlin tonight to discuss a range of issues, including Greece (as we covered earlier). And there are some reports that they could be developing a proposal to present to Greece, to avoid a default. Details are sketchy, and obviously rumours are rife. But Bloomberg had a good take. They reckon that the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are involved too. Bloomberg: Greece\u2019s Creditors Said to Meet in Berlin to Discuss Plans It would make sense, given today\u2019s concerns that Greece is running out of time to avoid a default, capital controls or fresh elections [as Goldman Sachs explained] Here\u2019s a flavour of Bloomberg\u2019s piece: Top level talks were said to be taking place in Berlin on Monday evening to hammer out a proposal that would be presented to Greece as its only realistic chance of avoiding default and safeguarding its membership of the euro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with French President Francois Hollande and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the German capital. Representatives of creditor institutions are said to be preparing to convene with them this evening to discuss a plan to resolve the deadlock over Greece, according to people familiar with the plan. They asked not to be named because the negotiations are private. The talks are at the highest level, according to the people. They involve Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, they said. A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment on the meeting.... We\u2019ll keep an eye for further developments.... Worries about Greece continued to unsettle investors, but differing results from May\u2019s manufacturing surveys was the main influence on markets. Signs of growth in Europe lifted most continental markets, but a disappointing UK figure - along with a falling oil price - helped send the FTSE 100 lower. Wall Street edged higher after a better than forecast ISM factory activity index, which pointed to a revival in the US economy but also suggested the Federal Reserve might indeed raise interest rates before the end of the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 30.85 or 0.44% at 6953.58 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.19% to 11,436.05 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.35% better at 5025.30 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.26% to 23,435.67 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.18% at 11,238.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 21.63 or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Italy\u2019s public finances are improving, according to the latest government figures. The country\u2019s state sector budget deficit came in at around \u20ac4.3bn in May, compared to \u20ac6.5bn in the same month last year. The Treasury said the deficit for the first five months of the year had narrowed by around \u20ac15bn from the same period last year to \u20ac33.8bn. The broader deficit figure which the stablity and growth pact uses is expected to fall from 3% of GDP in 2014 to 2.6%. Back with manufacturing, and here\u2019s Markit\u2019s global chart: A Greek exit from the eurozone may cause market ruptions in the short term but it could be a different story looking further ahead, says Capital Economics. But the recent moves in bond markets suggesting a deal could be reached may be mistaken, it adds, with spreads between German bunds and other goverment bonds looking remarkably low. Capital Economics Kevin Ferriter said: Spreads have presumably been contained as a result of four beliefs, each of which may be mistaken. First, a deal could be reached between Greece and its creditors. Second, a default does not automatically mean that Greece must exit the euro. Third, the ECB has backstops in place which are intended to prevent contagion. And fourth, if Greece does abandon the euro, this does not mean that other countries will necessarily follow suit. However, we think that investors are being complacent about these risks. Although a deal may be reached in these negotiations, the matter at hand is only the release of the final tranche of the existing bailout. We have not even got to the issue of the third bailout yet. Given how fractious the current talks have been, we envisage that further negotiations would reach an impasse. Meanwhile, although there is no automatic link between Greek default and Greek exit from the euro, one surely makes the other more likely. In particular, if losses are imposed on Greek debt held by the ECB, the Bank probably wouldn\u2019t then increase its exposure to Greece by sanctioning the provision of liquidity to its banks. In this situation, staying in the euro could mean a full-blown financial crisis in Greece. And even if defaulting allowed the Greek government to ease off on austerity, its economy will probably require a significant currency depreciation (only possible outside the euro-zone) to restore the competitiveness necessary to boost growth. Whatever the specifics of how a Greek default were handled, we are sceptical that the ECB\u2019s backstops would fully insulate other markets. The purchases of its quantitative easing (QE) programme be distributed across countries in proportion to the Bank\u2019s capital key, so it is currently an inappropriate tool for fire-fighting spikes in the bond markets of particular countries. And for the ECB\u2019s outright monetary transactions (OMTs) programme to be activated for a country, its government must have signed and be abiding by the conditions of a Memorandum of Understanding. Spreads could rise significantly before sufficient political will was mobilised to circumvent these technicalities. Finally, if Greece does exit the euro-zone, it is possible that it will only be the first domino. If Greece\u2019s economy eventually thrives without the choke of austerity and with a devalued currency, this may fuel the rise of anti-austerity and euro-sceptic movements in other European countries. Overall, we still think Greece\u2019s future inside the currency union remains highly uncertain, and if and when it leaves, this is likely to have a large short-run impact on markets \u2013 higher spreads on euro-zone sovereign bonds, a weaker euro, falls in equity prices and a rise in safe-haven demand. But the longer-term impact could be quite different if, as we expect, Greece was better off outside the euro-zone. The US market seems uncertain what to make of this latest set of data. As reported, the ISM manufacturing index came in stronger than forecast, and construction spending rose 2.2% to an annual rate of $1trn, the biggest percentage increase since May 2012. But other figures showed US consumer spending was unexpectedly flat in April as households cut back on expenditure and boosted their savings. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting somewhat, and is currently around 7 points or 0.03% lower. The ISM data adds to the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates in the third quarter, says James Knightley of ING. He says: The US ISM manufacturing index for May has come in at 52.8 versus 51.5. This is above the 52.0 consensus expectation and is the best reading since February. The production component actually fell (to 54.5 from 56.0 in April), but there was a decent rise in new orders (55.8 versus 53.5 previously) and employment (51.7 versus 48.3). Indeed, new orders are at a five month high while the employment component is recording its strongest reading since January. This all hints at a rebound from the economic contraction experienced in the first quarter of 2015 although other numbers, such as today\u2019s personal income and spending report, suggest it won\u2019t be particularly vigorous growth in the second quarter. Nonetheless, with the labour market continuing to make progress and real incomes moving in the right direction we suspect that consumer spending will make a more positive contribution to the growth story in the second half of the year with the Federal Reserve likely responding in the third quarter of 2015 with tighter monetary policy. Here\u2019s the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing data, which shows the pace of growth rising in May, with new orders and employment both rebounding. The ISM index of national factory activity was 52.8, up from 51.5 in April. The April figure was unchanged from March and the lowest since May 2013. The employment index rose from 48.3 in April to 51.7 in March, while new orders climbed from 53.5 to 55.8. Over in the US it\u2019s time for the day\u2019s two manufacturing surveys. First comes Markit\u2019s data, with its purchasing managers\u2019 index coming in at 54 in May, up slightly from an initial reading of 53.8 and marginally lower than April\u2019s 54.1. The new order component of the index fell from 55.3 in April to 54.3, its lowest level since January 2014. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: With manufacturers reporting the smallest rise in new orders since the start of last year, the survey provides further evidence that the strong dollar is hurting the economy. While the economy still looks set to rebound from the decline seen in the first quarter, the extent of the second quarter recovery therefore remains highly uncertain and could well disappoint. The ISM survey should follow shortly... Time for a recap on the Greek situation: Goldman Sachs has warned that Greece may need to default on a debt repayment to break the logjam between Athens and its creditors. Chief European economist Huw Pill predicts that \u201ca new political mandate and thus a new government, a referendum or new elections \u201d may be required in Greece. Not only is it possible that we may need to see sovereign technical default and/or blocked Greek bank deposits in order to come to an accommodation between Greece and its official creditors, it may be necessary to do so in order to break the current impasse in negotiations. Political tensions are swirling in Athens, after a group of Syriza MPs forced economist Elena Panaritis to withdraw as Greece\u2019s new IMF representative. One insider blamed the move on \u201cthe usual personal vendetta,\u201d showing that The European Commission has not reacted well to an opinion piece written by prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Le Monde today, accusing creditors of threatening European democracy. Spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels that: What matters more than op-eds are concrete reform proposals. Greek insiders are pinning their hopes of a political breakthrough on a meeting later today between Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Jean-Claude Juncker. As one official put it: \u201cWe are very close to the edge of the cliff, we are on the brink but we are not sure what is going to happen - yet.\u201d And new data has shown that Spanish and Italian factory output rose pretty strongly last month, but Germany slowed down and France contracted again. Paul Mason of Channel 4 News has a good explanation on why Greece\u2019s prime minister launched such a fierce critique of Europe\u2019s approach to the crisis, in Le Monde today. Mason (who is well-connected with Syriza) says Tsipras has reassessed his view of the situation, and is now convinced Germany wants to create a two-speed Europe... \u201c...where the \u2018core\u2019 will set tough rules regarding austerity and adaptation and will appoint a \u2018super\u2019 Finance Minister of the EZ with unlimited power, and with the ability to even reject budgets of sovereign states that are not aligned with the doctrines of extreme neoliberalism. For those countries that refuse to bow to the new authority, the solution will be simple: Harsh punishment. Mandatory austerity. And even worse, more restrictions on the movement of capital, disciplinary sanctions, fines and even a parallel currency\u201d. So Tsipras has responded by digging in, and showing he\u2019s prepared to take Greece into a default if the creditors don\u2019t compromise. Mason again: So we\u2019re in yet another nail-biting week. In a final flourish Tsipras advised the EU leaders to read Hemingway\u2019s novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls. As it\u2019s about a vicious civil war and the collapse of democracy in Europe in the 1930s, I think we all get the drift. But he could just as easily have quoted John Donne, from whom the phrase is taken: \u201cIf a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were.\u201d We\u2019ll know, I estimate within seven days, whether the Germans think Greece a promontory worth saving. More here: Greece: a clod of earth worth saving? Back in Athens, Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 anti-austerity coalition is hoping that tonight\u2019s meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande will provide a breakthrough (of sorts), reports Helena. The Greek media is now full of reports of an interim deal being cut that would tide the country over in the coming months in terms of its heavy debt repayment schedule - but leave all the hard work of a longer-term agreement for the fall. The well-informed Naftemporiki is splashing the story under the headline \u201cclose to a temporary agreement.\u201d Tsipras, it says, is placing his hopes on tonight\u2019s meeting helping to create a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d even if Greece will not be the focus of talks when Merkel, Hollande and EU president Jean-Claude Juncker do sit around the table. Naftemporiki says: \u201cUnder no circumstances will it be the broad \u201cunified\u201d deal that the government had hoped for, since it will even leave open the evaluation of the current programme which expires on June 30. The \u201cgood\u201d scenario for the government would be for the deal [to include] a forecast for the debt (something that at this juncture is considered extremely difficult if not impossible) and to have a growth prospect (which is the more likely scenario). Essentially, with a \u201ctemporary\u201d agreement the government and the prime minister will solve, albeit fleetingly, the suffocating problem of the country\u2019s financial needs while on the lenders part a painful \u201cGrexit\u201d will be avoided.\u201d Both sides, the paper said, had agreed that the differences of view expressed by technical teams had not been resolved and would not (and could not) be bridged in the days ahead. Elena Panaritis\u2019 resignation letter today has (if unwittingly) underlined the disparities saying \u201cthe country is going through its most difficult period.\u201d A finance ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told me earlier that that the government recognised it was \u201cvery close to the edge of the cliff.\u201d He said: \u201cWe are very close to the edge of the cliff, we are on the brink but we are not sure what is going to happen - yet.\u201d The scenario sounds very much like the four-month extension we had reported in this blog on May 21st - under which Greece would be given some leeway to draw up reforms (and perhaps hold fresh elections). The euro is coming back from its earlier selloff too.... Don\u2019t get excited if you hear that a Greek deal is coming this afternoon. A wild, unsourced and frankly baffling rumour did just sweep City trading floors and Twitter, but there seems to be nothing in it. And it\u2019s now being denied: OFFICIALS CLOSE TO CREDITOR TALKS WITH ATHENS DENY MARKET TALK THAT A DEAL WITH GREECE IS TO BE ANNOUNCED THIS AFTERNOON A false alarm on Greece isn\u2019t new. What\u2019s truly perplexing, though, is that it actually moved the markets... In the wake of Elena Panaritis\u2019 withdrawal, the Greek government has issued one of its famous non-papers distancing finance minister Yanis Varoufakis from her appointment to the International Monetary Fund in the first place. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports. \u201cThe choice of Elena Panaritis, as the country\u2019s IMF representative, was made collectively,\u201d the paper stated. \u201cThe view that has been heard that Yanis Varoufakis appointed her does not correspond to reality.\u201d In her own statement, Panaritis made clear that she did not ask for the post. \u201cAs I never sought this post, and given that I accepted it exclusively to help the government based on my experience on the way the IMF works (and other corresponding organisations) it is impossible for me to accept my appointment in the midst of the negative reactions of Syriza\u2019s MPs and cadres.\u201d A finance ministry official told me this morning that Panaritis had been at the receiving end of ugly sniping. \u201cIt\u2019s the usual personal vendetta,\u201d said one. Panaritis thanked Varoufakis and national economy minister Giorgos Stathakis for their support. The irony, though, is that Panaritis, a former World Bank economist, was thoroughly disheartened by the Pasok party (she was an Pasok MP from 2009 to 2012), and especially its erstwhile leader George Papandreou who persuaded her to leave the US for Greece. Papandreou, who appealed to the IMF for help when it became clear that the country would be unable to stand alone, financially, was accused by Panartisis of ignoring her, and the invaluable advice she had to offer, when she moved, at his request, to Athens. Bond traders are ditching short-term Greek debt this morning, driving up the yield on two-year bonds higher into the danger zone. The lack of a deal and Alexis Tsipras\u2019s claim that Greece\u2019s creditors are threatening European democracy have not calmed nerves in the City today: GREEK TWO-YEAR BOND YIELDS RISE OVER 100 BASIS POINTS TO DAY\u2019S HIGH OF 24.67% Associated Press is also reporting that government MPs forced Elena Panaritis to abandon plans to represent Greece at the International Monetary Fund. Breaking News! Elena Panaritis has just announced that she does not wish to be Greece\u2019s new representative at the International Monetary Fund, according to local media. She has withdrawn following the backlash from Syriza MPs who wrote to prime minister Alexis Tsipras, saying her previuus support for Greece\u2019s bailout programmes made her an unacceptable candidate (see earlier post). This u-turn calms the danger that the government could split. But it\u2019s also something of a blow to finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, as he\u2019d proposed Panaritis for the role. As feared, Alexis Tsipras\u2019s blunt attack on the \u201cabsurd demands\u201d made by Greece\u2019s creditors has not improved the mood in Brussels. Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s official spokesperson, Mina Andreeva, has just told reporters that it\u2019s more important to deliver \u2018concrete reform proposals\u2019 rather than opinion pieces in Le Monde. Danny Kemp, AFP\u2019s Brussels deputy bureau chief, has all the details from Andreeva\u2019s briefing: And there\u2019s no chance of an emergency eurogroup meeting until those proposals are drawn up: Sigmar Gabriel, the vice-chancellor of Germany, says he\u2019s not given up hope of a Greek deal. Gabriel told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cI believe that all the proposals are now on the table and we can only hope that those holding political responsibility, also those in responsibility in Greece, will use the little time that is still left to reach decisions.\u201d (quote via Reuters) Nice line in understatement here: This is why June is such a crunch month for Greece: Negotiations between Greece and her creditors seem to have hit an impasse, and could trigger new elections, a referendum or capital controls on bank deposits, or even a default, warns Goldman Sachs this morning. Huw Pill, Goldman\u2019s chief European economist, fears it will be \u201cvery challenging\u201d for the two sides to reach a deal to unlock the final \u20ac7.2bn of Greece\u2019s bailout aid. And although his \u201cbase case\u201d is still that a compromise will ultimately be reached, the situation could become a lot worse first. Pill argues that the platform on which the current Greek government was elected \u2013 to retaining the Euro but with no further adjustment and/or external oversight \u2013 is \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with the demands of lenders. And without a deal, Greece\u2019s remaining government cash reserves will soon be exhausted. Facing this reality, a new political mandate and thus a new government, a referendum or new elections will be required in Greece. Not only is it possible that we may need to see sovereign technical default and/or blocked Greek bank deposits in order to come to an accommodation between Greece and its official creditors, it may be necessary to do so in order to break the current impasse in negotiations. Pill argues that Greece\u2019s creditors cannot give ground on three key principles, which aren\u2019t compatible with Athens\u2019 own pledges: Retaining the Euro requires further economic adjustment in Greece\u037e To the extent that this adjustment entails further financial support (which is selfevident given upcoming obligations), that support will only be provided on the basis of conditionality. In order to assess compliance with such conditionality, external oversight of the Greek economy is required. And prime minister Tsipras can\u2019t change his own position without a new political mandate. As such, Goldman believes that the probability of a Greek exit is \u201cclearly not zero\u201d, and has been rising in recent weeks. As Pill concludes: The ongoing negotiations between Greece and its official creditors are intensely political. And forwardlooking economic rationality is not characteristic of such interactions. Not only is it possible that we may need to see technical default and deposit blocks in order to come to a new programme, it may be necessary to do so in order to break the current impasse in negotiations. Back to Greece....and it appears that a major row is blowing up over the nomination of the new Greek representative at the IMF. As flagged earlier, 43 Syriza MPs and other senior party officials have signed a letter expressing strong disapproval for the selection of Elena Panaritis. They argue that Panaritis is a poor choice, as she was a Pasok MP between 2009 and 2012, when the left-wing party signed up for Greece\u2019s first bailout. As the letter puts it: \u201cA prominent representative of bailout policies cannot represent the government...It\u2019s not a symbolic but a political issue. It\u2019s a wrong decision and we ask that it is taken back.\u201d Panaritis was the favoured choice of finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (thus his announcement yesterday that rumours of his resignation were grossly premature) But pressure is building. Enikos, the Greek news site, has published photos of a rather stressed-looking Varoufakis last night after talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. There are reports today that Tsipras is now looking for a new candidate to replace Panaritis..... Britain\u2019s factories grew a little faster last month. The UK manufacturing PMI edged up to 52.0, up from 51.8. Heads-up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker are meeting in Berlin today for talks about Europe\u2019s future. Greece\u2019s bailout talks, and David Cameron\u2019s bid to renegotiate the UK\u2019s links with Europe, will be on the table. It\u2019s official: Germany and France are dragging the eurozone back. Markit\u2019s Eurozone Manufacturing PMI, just released, came in at 52.2 in May. That is up from April\u2019s 52.0 and matches March\u2019s figure (which was a 10-month high), but is below the flash estimate of 52.3 two weeks ago. And as covered earlier, Spain and Italy performed rather better than the eurozone\u2019s two largest members: Chris Williamson of Markit says factories in the core need to watch out: \u201cThe rate of growth is modest rather than spectacular, however, and there are clearly countries which continue to struggle. Weakness is centred in the region\u2019s core, with France\u2019s manufacturing sector still in decline and Germany only seeing very meagre growth. \u201cOn the other hand, Spain and Italy appear to be staging strong recoveries, benefitting in particular from impressive export performances. Such export gains point to improved competitiveness which bodes well for longer-term economic prospects. Manufacturers in France and Germany need to be mindful of such competition.\u201d Germany\u2019s factory growth slowed last month, and by more than expected: France\u2019s factory sector is still shrinking. Markit\u2019s French manufacturing PMI rose to 49.4, up from 48.0 in April -- the best reading in a year, but still below the 50-point mark showing no-change. Boom! Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector has reported its biggest jump in output in four years. Factories saw a sharp increase in output and new orders in May, leading to a rise in hiring. That pushed Markit\u2019s Italy manufacturing PMI up to 54.8 from 53.8 in April -- which is the highest reading since April 2011. Italy\u2019s economy finally returned to growth in the last quarter, and the outlook looks quite bright: Phil Smith, Economist at Markit which compiles the Italy Manufacturing PMI\u00ae survey, said: \u201cItaly\u2019s manufacturing sector is enjoying its best quarter of expansion since 2011. Output growth has accelerated in every month this year so far, and a further strong increase in new orders suggests production is set to remain on an upward trend throughout the summer. Dutch factories enjoyed a good May (like their counterparts in Spain) with the sector growing at its fastest rate since December 2013. The euro is weakening this morning, as concerns over Greece weigh on the market. The single currency has dropped by 0.7% against the US dollar, from $1.0987 to $1.091. That\u2019s helping to push Europe\u2019s stock markets higher this morning, as a weaker euro is good news for exporters. The recovery in Spain\u2019s factory sector continued last month, with output growing at the fastest rate since April 2007. Markit\u2019s Spanish manufacturing PMI jumped to 55.8 in May from 54.2 in April, showing \u201ca sharp improvement in business conditions\u201d. New orders and new exports both increase, encouraging firms to take on more staff \u2013 that\u2019s welcome news for Spain\u2019s army of unemployed. Italy\u2019s prime minister, the reformist Matteo Renzi, has been given a wake-up call by disgruntled voters. Renzi\u2019s centre-left Democratic party performed worse than expected in regional elections last weekend, as populist and anti-establishment parties enjoyed a rise in support. It lost the governorship of Liguria, which is usually a left-wing stronghold, and was pushed hard in other districts. The Five Star Movement led by comedian Beppe Grillo performed well, picking up more than 20% of the vote in some areas. Worryingly for Renzi (and pro-Europeans generally), is the strong showing recorded by the anti-euro, anti-immigrant Northern League. One consolation for Renzi, though... at least he didn\u2019t campaign for the wrong party.... China\u2019s stock market has surged this morning, following the news that its factory sector had contracted for the third month running. Traders piled into stocks in Shanghai, giving the main index its biggest one-day gain since January. They reckon that the weak PMI report (details here) raises the chances that Beijing will announce new stimulus measures. A top official at Germany\u2019s Bundesbank has warned that Greek banks are on the brink of crisis. Andreas Dombret, an executive board member of the German central bank, told Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper that the Athens government must move swiftly to reach agreement with creditors: \u201cThe Greek government would be well advised to act quickly - for the Greek banks, it is five minutes to midnight.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Greece is very critical and bank customers see that naturally...The direct dangers for European banks are relatively small.\u201d Last Friday we learned that Greece\u2019s bank deposits had hit an 11-year low in April, as fears of default or capital controls spooked savers: Greece may have invented democracy, but it still has a bit to learn about diplomacy. Last night, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras tore into the country\u2019s creditors for making \u2018absurd\u2019 demands on Athens. Writing in Le Monde, Tsipras insisted that the blame for the lack of progress since he took office in late January must lie on the institutions who oversee its bailout programmes. He wrote: \u201cThe lack of an agreement so far is not due to the supposed intransigent, uncompromising and incomprehensible Greek stance. It is due to the insistence of certain institutional actors on submitting absurd proposals and displaying a total indifference to the recent democratic choice of the Greek people.\u201d And those counties who believe Greece must be put in her place risk: ....the beginning of the end for the European unification project by shifting the Eurozone from a monetary union to an exchange rate zone, [and] also triggers economic and political uncertainty, which is likely to entirely transform the economic and political balances throughout the West. Europe, Tsipras concludes, is at \u201ca crossroads\u201d, and must choose between \u201csolidarity, equality and democracy,\u201d or \u201crupture and division?\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 article in Le Monde newspaper: Europe at crossroads The Financial Times reckons that Tsipras\u2019s intervention has \u201cincreased the sense of chaos around negotiations in the week many believe a deal is needed to avoid a Greek default.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The clock is ticking louder for Greece, as Athens and its creditors continue to struggle to agree a deal before its bailout expires at the end of the month. Hopes of a deal by Sunday have, alas, not materialised. Instead, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis spent part of yesterday denying that he was about to resign. He\u2019s under pressure from a group of 40-plus government MPs, who oppose his choice of economist Elena Panaritis as Greece\u2019s new representative at the International Monetary Fund. More here: Yanis Varoufakis dismisses rumours he intends to resign as \u2018grossly premature\u2019 Also coming up.... There\u2019s plenty of economic news around this morning, as Markit releases its estimates of growth across the global manufacturing sector. We get Spain, Italy, France and Germany between 8am and 9am BST, followed by the UK at 9.30am. Markit and HSBC have already reported that output across China\u2019s small and medium-sized factories fell again last month, in the latest sign its economy is slowing. An official government report reckoned the overall sector grew slightly. More here: China HSBC PMI contracts for third month in May And we\u2019ll keep an eye on the oil market. The OPEC cartel are due to meet on Friday, to vote whether to maintain production levels. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Capital Economics Kevin Ferriter said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spreads have presumably been contained as a result of four beliefs, each of which may be mistaken. First, a deal could be reached between Greece and its creditors. Second, a default does not automatically mean that Greece must exit the euro. Third, the ECB has backstops in place which are intended to prevent contagion. And fourth, if Greece does abandon the euro, this does not mean that other countries will necessarily follow suit.</p> <p>However, we think that investors are being complacent about these risks. Although a deal may be reached in these negotiations, the matter at hand is only the release of the final tranche of the existing bailout. We have not even got to the issue of the third bailout yet. Given how fractious the current talks have been, we envisage that further negotiations would reach an impasse.</p> <p> Meanwhile, although there is no automatic link between Greek default and Greek exit from the euro, one surely makes the other more likely. In particular, if losses are imposed on Greek debt held by the ECB, the Bank probably wouldn\u2019t then increase its exposure to Greece by sanctioning the provision of liquidity to its banks. In this situation, staying in the euro could mean a full-blown financial crisis in Greece. And even if defaulting allowed the Greek government to ease off on austerity, its economy will probably require a significant currency depreciation (only possible outside the euro-zone) to restore the competitiveness necessary to boost growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e50ded5cb4083224e50359f02906fbe37ce0273f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433171321057/cefeb0f2-68c4-46d6-9acd-fab9a3e461b2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Eurozone under pressure.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurozone under pressure.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Whatever the specifics of how a Greek default were handled, we are sceptical that the ECB\u2019s backstops would fully insulate other markets. The purchases of its quantitative easing (QE) programme be distributed across countries in proportion to the Bank\u2019s capital key, so it is currently an inappropriate tool for fire-fighting spikes in the bond markets of particular countries. And for the ECB\u2019s outright monetary transactions (OMTs) programme to be activated for a country, its government must have signed and be abiding by the conditions of a Memorandum of Understanding. Spreads could rise significantly before sufficient political will was mobilised to circumvent these technicalities.</p> <p>Finally, if Greece does exit the euro-zone, it is possible that it will only be the first domino. If Greece\u2019s economy eventually thrives without the choke of austerity and with a devalued currency, this may fuel the rise of anti-austerity and euro-sceptic movements in other European countries.</p> <p><em><strong>Overall, we still think Greece\u2019s future inside the currency union remains highly uncertain, and if and when it leaves, this is likely to have a large short-run impact on markets \u2013 higher spreads on euro-zone sovereign bonds, a weaker euro, falls in equity prices and a rise in safe-haven demand.

Gulliver has already said he will set out on the day the methodology the bank will use to compare head office locations, forming the basis of any decision to move its HQ out of London. The bank caused political shockwaves in April when it said it was considering pulling out of the city, where it has been based since 1992 after relocating from Hong Kong. Gulliver said at the time that any change in location would affect just 250 roles and the board would be presented with the view of the executive team by the end of the year.

    "webTitle": "Greece may need to default on debts as IMF deadline looms, warns Goldman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece may have to default on its debts and impose curbs on bank withdrawals before reaching a deal with its creditors, according to Goldman Sachs, as a crucial payment deadline approaches. The pressure on Athens increased on Monday as a senior German central banker warned that it was \u201cfive minutes to midnight\u201d for a Greek financial system on the cusp of collapse. Goldman Sachs broached the subject of a default in a note published on Monday, claiming that the country could be forced into drastic measures amid fears that it will miss a \u20ac305m (\u00a3220m) payment due on Friday to the International Monetary Fund. It will be \u201cvery challenging\u201d for Greece and its creditors to reach a deal to unlock the final \u20ac7.2bn of the country\u2019s bailout aid, said the bank\u2019s chief European economist, Huw Pill. Warning that Greek government cash reserves were nearly exhausted, Pill said new elections could be triggered in Greece, alongside a debt default and limits on removing cash from banks. \u201cFacing this reality, a new political mandate and thus a new government, a referendum or new elections will be required in Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is it possible that we may need to see sovereign technical default and/or blocked Greek bank deposits in order to come to an accommodation between Greece and its official creditors, it may be necessary to do so in order to break the current impasse in negotiations.\u201d Greek banks, which have been surviving on emergency loans from the European Central Bank, have seen massive outflows in the past week. Andreas Dombret, an executive board member of the German central bank, told the Bild newspaper: \u201cThe Greek government would be well advised to act quickly. For the Greeks banks, it is five minutes to midnight.\u201d At the beginning of a month that could decide the country\u2019s future in the euro, the government of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has signalled it is holding out for an interim agreement with the country\u2019s three creditors: the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank. \u201cA temporary deal is close,\u201d said the financial daily Naftemporiki, citing government sources. Greek sources were investing hopes in the meeting in Berlin on Monday night between the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the president of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. After five months of fruitless talks and several false dawns, EU officials refused to be drawn on whether a cash-for-reform deal was in sight, leading to the release of at least some of the \u20ac7.2bn in rescue aid still outstanding. With its current bailout programme expiring on 30 June and debt repayments this month alone of \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF, all agree that crunch time has arrived for Greece. After a series of increasingly desperate moves \u2013 sequestering funds from local authorities and government bodies \u2013 cash reserves have all but run dry. \u201cWe are at the edge of the cliff, we are on the brink,\u201d a finance ministry official told the Guardian. It was unclear, he said, what would happen next. In the final stretch of negotiations that began when Tsipras\u2019s radical left Syriza party was catapulted into office in January, lenders showed little inclination on Monday of being lenient. Speaking in Berlin, which has provided the bulk of Athens\u2019 \u20ac240bn bailout, Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, reiterated that the price of further assistance would be a \u201cfar-reaching reform package\u201d. The German finance ministry struck a similar note, announcing that Greece still had to deregulate its labour market, reform its social security system and push ahead with the sale of state-owned assets. \u201cThe aim of these individual measures is to restore Greece\u2019s debt sustainability,\u201d said finance ministry spokesman, Martin Jaeger. The three-way talks in Berlin came a day after Tsipras issued an excoriating critique of Greece\u2019s creditors, claiming they were making \u201cabsurd\u201d demands of his government. In a newspaper opinion piece highlighting the depths of the divide between Athens and its creditors, the leader said the eurozone was at risk of being transformed into a \u201ctechnocratic monstrosity\u201d. \u201cThe issue of Greece does not only concern Greece,\u201d Tsipras wrote in Le Monde. \u201cRather, it is the very epicentre of conflict between two diametrically opposing strategies concerning the future of European unification.\u201d While the first strategy, he said, aimed to \u201cdeepen European unification in the context of equality and solidarity,\u201d the second strategy aimed to demolish it. Reacting to the blunt attack, Juncker\u2019s spokesperson hit back saying what mattered more in Greece\u2019s battle to stay afloat were \u201cconcrete reform proposals\u201d than op-eds. \u201cIntense technical discussions have been taking place over the weekend and are continuing to take place,\u201d Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels. \u201cProgress has been made but we are not there yet.\u201d Even if a deal was agreed, it is likely to be messy and short\u2013term, providing the country relief over a summer replete with debt repayments but once again kicking the great Greek debt crisis down the road. Athens must repay ECB bonds worth \u20ac6.7bn in July and August. \u201cUnder no circumstances will it be the broad \u2018unified\u2019 deal that the government had hoped for, since it will even leave open the evaluation of the current programme which expires on 30 June,\u201d Naftemporiki said. \u201cEssentially, with a \u2018temporary\u2019 agreement the government and the prime minister will solve, albeit fleetingly, the suffocating problem of the country\u2019s financial needs while on the part of the lenders a painful \u2018Grexit\u2019 will have been avoided.\u201d Differences over demands that both sides had been unable to bridge would be tackled again in the autumn. Tsipras faces mounting dissent from within his own ranks, with infighting in Syriza boiling over as the government failed to reach a promised agreement with lenders. The politician was forced to drop the World Bank economist Elena Panaritis, who had been proposed for the post of Greek representative at the IMF, after senior government officials demanded that the appointment be cancelled on the grounds that she had previously represented the pro-bailout Pasok party in parliament. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2015. An earlier version referred to \u201chandouts\u201d where \u201cloans\u201d was meant.",

For the Greeks banks, it is five minutes to midnight.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning of a month that could decide the country\u2019s future in the euro, the government of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has signalled it is holding out for an interim agreement with the country\u2019s three creditors: the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank. <br></p> <p> \u201cA temporary deal is close,\u201d said the financial daily Naftemporiki, citing government sources. Greek sources were investing hopes in the meeting in Berlin on Monday night between the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the president of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The Greek government would be well advised to act quickly. For the Greeks banks it is five minutes to midnight</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Dombret</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> After five months of fruitless talks and several false dawns, EU officials refused to be drawn on whether a cash-for-reform deal was in sight, leading to the release of at least some of the \u20ac7.2bn in rescue aid still outstanding.</p> <p> With its current bailout programme expiring on 30 June and debt repayments this month alone of \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF, all agree that crunch time has arrived for Greece. After a series of increasingly desperate moves \u2013 sequestering funds from local authorities and government bodies \u2013 cash reserves have all but run dry.</p> <p>\u201cWe are at the edge of the cliff, we are on the brink,\u201d a finance ministry official told the Guardian. It was unclear, he said, what would happen next. </p> <p>In the final stretch of negotiations that began when Tsipras\u2019s radical left Syriza party was catapulted into office in January, lenders showed little inclination on Monday of being lenient. Speaking in Berlin, which has provided the bulk of Athens\u2019 \u20ac240bn bailout, Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, reiterated that the price of further assistance would be a \u201cfar-reaching reform package\u201d.</p> <p> The German finance ministry struck a similar note, announcing that Greece still had to deregulate its labour market, reform its social security system and push ahead with the sale of state-owned assets. \u201cThe aim of these individual measures is to restore Greece\u2019s debt sustainability,\u201d said finance ministry spokesman, Martin Jaeger. </p> <p> The three-way talks in Berlin came a day after Tsipras issued an excoriating critique of Greece\u2019s creditors, claiming they were making \u201cabsurd\u201d demands of his government.</p> <p>In a newspaper opinion piece highlighting the depths of the divide between Athens and its creditors, the leader said the eurozone was at risk of being transformed into a \u201ctechnocratic monstrosity\u201d. \u201cThe issue of Greece does not only concern Greece,\u201d Tsipras wrote in Le Monde. \u201cRather, it is the very epicentre of conflict between two diametrically opposing strategies concerning the future of European unification.\u201d</p> <p> While the first strategy, he said, aimed to \u201cdeepen European unification in the context of equality and solidarity,\u201d the second strategy aimed to demolish it.</p> <p> Reacting to the blunt attack, Juncker\u2019s spokesperson hit back saying what mattered more in Greece\u2019s battle to stay afloat were \u201cconcrete reform proposals\u201d than op-eds. \u201cIntense technical discussions have been taking place over the weekend and are continuing to take place,\u201d Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels. \u201cProgress has been made but we are not there yet.\u201d</p> <p> Even if a deal was agreed, it is likely to be messy and short\u2013term, providing the country relief over a summer replete with debt repayments but once again kicking the great Greek debt crisis down the road. Athens must repay ECB bonds worth \u20ac6.7bn in July and August.</p> <p> \u201cUnder no circumstances will it be the broad \u2018unified\u2019 deal that the government had hoped for, since it will even leave open the evaluation of the current programme which expires on 30 June,\u201d Naftemporiki said. \u201cEssentially, with a \u2018temporary\u2019 agreement the government and the prime minister will solve, albeit fleetingly, the suffocating problem of the country\u2019s financial needs while on the part of the lenders a painful \u2018Grexit\u2019 will have been avoided.\u201d</p> <p>Differences over demands that both sides had been unable to bridge would be tackled again in the autumn.</p> <p>Tsipras faces mounting dissent from within his own ranks, with infighting in Syriza boiling over as the government failed to reach a promised agreement with lenders.</p> <p>The politician was forced to drop the World Bank economist Elena Panaritis, who had been proposed for the post of Greek representative at the IMF, after senior government officials demanded that the appointment be cancelled on the grounds that she had previously represented the pro-bailout Pasok party in parliament.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2015. An earlier version referred to \u201chandouts\u201d where \u201cloans\u201d was meant.</p>",

At the weekend, Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, blamed creditors\u2019 \u201cabsurd proposals\u201d for the failure to reach a deal to release bailout cash, arguing that eurozone hardliners wanted to create a \u201ctwo-speed Europe.\u201d Then Greece\u2019s new representative at the IMF withdrew from the job under pressure from MPs within the ruling Syriza party. Despite all that, there was brief excitement when it was rumoured that a funding and reform package was set to be announced within hours. Naturally, nothing materialised. In theory, the logjam could be broken at any time in the coming days. In practice, one suspects the cold-headed argument made by Huw Pill, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief European economist, is correct: a technical default by Greece, creating even more pressure on its banking system, may be necessary to encourage a deal. Then there is an equally important point: even if a deal is struck, new elections, or a referendum, may be required to provide a new political mandate in Greece. The thought behind both points is simple. Syriza is not going to get what it was elected to deliver \u2013 continued membership of the euro but with no austerity conditions attached and no oversight by lenders. That prize is not on the table. A technical default, intensifying the squeeze on Greek banks, might lead to the Greek government paying pensions in IOUs and wages in cheques drawn on Greek banks that lack funds. At that point, Pill argues, it would be easier to sell a deal within Greece that increases the chances of public sector workers and pensioners being paid in hard euros. Such a process would be brutal, of course, but it may be the reality of the political standoff. It would also mean weeks of delay before elections or a referendum could be held. This week\u2019s supposed make-or-break moment, then, may be less than it appears: the last chapter arrives only when Greek electors have spoken. Lloyds: trading plan beats retail plan It is very sensible for George Osborne to extend until the end of the year the dripfeed of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s shares into the market. The so-called \u201ctrading plan\u201d devised last December is working well. The state\u2019s stake has fallen from 25% to 19% in a little less than four months and the public purse has been receiving progressively better prices for its shares. As argued here previously, the success of the trading plan makes a flashy offer of shares to private investors completely unnecessary. The government is on the hook, of course, because David Cameron made a pre-election promise. But, really, what\u2019s the point? Officially, it is to promote a share-owning democracy and allow the punters to share in the revival of Lloyds. What the government doesn\u2019t mention, though, is that the bells and whistles of a retail offer \u2013 the discounts and loyalty bonuses \u2013 are a cost to the public purse. The sums are not enormous. Depending on how generous Osborne wants to be with other people\u2019s money, they might add up to \u00a3200m-\u00a3400m, which is not so much in the context of the original \u00a320bn bailout. But it is also money that does not have to be spent. At the current rate of progress, the little-and-often trading plan would find buyers for the remaining shares within a year or so at the keenest prices. A retail offer will take longer (it probably wouldn\u2019t happen until next spring and then the government would have to hang on to the rump loyalty shares for 12 months) and will involve discounts. The choice ought to be simple: stick to the trading plan. It is only a rash election pledge that is getting in the way of common sense. A quick deal for Plus500 After seeing their shares fall rapidly from 750p to 250p, investors in spreadbetting outfit Plus500 may be grateful for small mercies, such as Teddy Sagi\u2019s Playtech gaming firm showing up with a \u00a3460m, or 400p-a-share, bid. If the agreed takeover happens, it would indeed represent a happy-ish ending for Plus500, at least for those investors who bought at flotation at 115p in 2013. The company, having grown too quickly for its own good, is currently in a fine pickle, obliged to implement money-laundering checks on customers in a hurry under the orders of regulators. But this deal has been negotiated in the space of a week. Even with everybody working flat-out, there is a limit to how much due diligence Playtech can have done. Material adverse change clauses apply, note. Plus500 shareholders should back the deal \u2013 but also cross their fingers.",

      "bodyText": "Consider these statistics: more than one in three (37%) respondents to a survey conducted by the Competition and Markets Authority have held their current accounts with the same bank for 20 years or more. Almost two in three (58%) think it is important that their bank has a national branch network. Just 3% of bank customers switched their main accounts last year. According to the CMA, which has been investigating high street banking, customers are far less likely to switch bank than they are to move to a new car insurer or energy provider. Nevertheless, a number of would-be new banks are in talks with the Bank of England to begin operating, without big branch networks, but with an aim to win customers in a market dominated by the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Atom Bank, a digital-only venture targeting personal customers and small businesses, is hopeful of receiving its banking licence at the end of the month. It is the brainchild of Anthony Thomson, who created Metro Bank , which in 2010 became the first bank in 150 years to open its doors. Thomson has since caught the digital bug, preferring to focus on the statistics showing the dramatic uptake of digital channels. Lloyds, which has the country\u2019s biggest high street presence from which it is axing 200 branches, says three years ago none of its customers were using mobile technology compared with 5 million last year. \u201cIt is the most seismic change in customer behaviour from my 30-year [career],\u201d Thomson said. With hopes for a launch of the first products in the first half of 2015 dashed, Thomson said the Durham-based venture intended to start offering products to customers by the end of the year. Personal customers will be targeted first, possibly with a current account, and small business customers later. The CMA\u2019s recent update on its investigation into competition for high street banking lists Atom and another aspiring bank, Starling, as potential new contenders. But it reveals that it intends to conduct research into whether bank branches are a barrier to new entrants. Anne Boden, a former Allied Irish Bank executive who is chief executive of Starling, has found the process of applying for a licence is taking longer than expected. A hoped-for launch of a digital-based current account this year has slipped into 2016, but Bodensaid Starling could still act as a disruptor to the incumbent players. \u201cThe regulatory environment has changed dramatically for start-up banks in the last couple of years. People\u2019s receptiveness to mobile technology has changed and post-crisis what people want from their banks have changed,\u201d she said. The previous government made it easier for new banks to seek authorisation from the Bank of England and, at the end of this month, another series of rule changes will make it easier for would-be banks to gain access to the payments systemswhich move money around behind the scenes. Four banks, including Atom, have applications being considered by the regulator. In addition, OakNorth, for which former top City regulator Lord Turner is a non-executive director, has recently been authorised, although it is targeting small-business customers and offering only saving products to retail customers. Starling\u2019s application for a banking licence is yet to be submitted, although Boden hopes to receive one before the end of the year. She is pressing on with Starling after a high-profile split in the founding team this year and intends to offer only current accounts. There are reports her former partners are considering setting up a rival. \u201cWe are a much more disruptive model we are going to have a go at creating the best current account in the world,\u201d Boden said. \u201cWe are not intending to do all the things a traditional bank does. We think the market will fragment.\u201d Boden is reluctant to discuss her backers \u2013 advertising agency WPP has reportedly been interested in the past. But without a branch network and legacy issues associated with scandals, such as payment protection insurance, which are holding back the profits of the incumbent big current account providers, Boden aims to make money from net interest margin and the interchange fee banks receive when customers use debit cards. Atom and Starling say they will needaccess to branches and hope to sign deals with banks to allow customers to pay in cash over the counter. The CMA\u2019sresearch showed that 40% of respondents visited a bank branch once or more each month. Of those, 9% went once a week or more \u2013 the vast majority (85%) to pay in cash or cheques. New branch-based banks are also arriving on the high street after being carved out of existing players as punishment by the EU for taxpayer bailouts. Lloyds Banking Group has spun out TSB (now being sold to Sabadell of Spain), while Royal Bank of Scotland is attempting to hive off 300 or so branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn logo, possibly some time next year. Thomson hopes to take on the branch-based banks this year. How big is Atom aiming? \u201cIt is a question of how accepting of his model people are going to be. We\u2019ve got to get it up and running. People will then vote with their feet \u2013 or fingers.\u201d",

A hoped-for launch of a digital-based current account this year has slipped into 2016, but Bodensaid Starling could still act as a disruptor to the incumbent players.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe regulatory environment has changed dramatically for start-up banks in the last couple of years. People\u2019s receptiveness to mobile technology has changed and post-crisis what people want from their banks have changed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The previous government made it easier for new banks to seek authorisation from the Bank of England and, at the end of this month, another series of rule changes will make it easier for would-be banks to gain access to the payments systemswhich move money around behind the scenes. </p> <p>Four banks, including Atom, have applications being considered by the regulator. In addition, OakNorth, for which former top City regulator Lord Turner is a non-executive director, has recently been authorised, although it is targeting small-business customers and offering only saving products to retail customers.</p> <p>Starling\u2019s application for a banking licence is yet to be submitted, although Boden hopes to receive one before the end of the year. She is pressing on with Starling after a high-profile split in the founding team this year and intends to offer only current accounts. There are reports her former partners are considering setting up a rival.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a much more disruptive model we are going to have a go at creating the best current account in the world,\u201d Boden said. \u201cWe are not intending to do all the things a traditional bank does. We think the market will fragment.\u201d</p> <p>Boden is reluctant to discuss her backers \u2013 advertising agency WPP has reportedly been interested in the past. But without a branch network and legacy issues associated with scandals, such as payment protection insurance, which are holding back the profits of the incumbent big current account providers, Boden aims to make money from net interest margin and the interchange fee banks receive when customers use debit cards.</p> <p>Atom and Starling say they will needaccess to branches and hope to sign deals with banks to allow customers to pay in cash over the counter. The CMA\u2019sresearch showed that 40% of respondents visited a bank branch once or more each month. Of those, 9% went once a week or more \u2013 the vast majority (85%) to pay in cash or cheques.</p> <p>New branch-based banks are also arriving on the high street after being carved out of existing players as punishment by the EU for taxpayer bailouts. Lloyds Banking Group has spun out TSB (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/lloyds-sells-50-of-tsb-to-spains-sabadell\">now being sold to Sabadell of Spain</a>), while Royal Bank of Scotland is attempting to hive off 300 or so branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn logo, possibly some time next year.</p> <p>Thomson hopes to take on the branch-based banks this year. How big is Atom aiming? \u201cIt is a question of how accepting of his model people are going to be. We\u2019ve got to get it up and running. People will then vote with their feet \u2013 or fingers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House address to senior City figures next week to sketch out how he intends to start the sale of the government\u2019s 79% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland since the 2008 crisis. In the runup to the general election, Osborne signalled his intention to kickstart a disposal programme for RBS early in this parliament and he has used the set-piece address at Mansion House in the past to outline policies on the banking sector. RBS is still 79% owned by the taxpayer, in contrast with Lloyds Banking Group where the government stake has fallen below 19% after it was announced on Monday that another tranche of shares had been sold into the market. Osborne said he would press on with selling the taxpayers\u2019 stake in Lloyds after recouping \u00a310.5bn for the exchequer through a series of disposals in the past 18 months. A programme of dripfeeding Lloyds shares into the market \u2013 which was due to finish at the end of the month \u2013 is being extended to the end of the year, while some shares are being earmarked for sale to retail investors in the next 12 months. The stake in Lloyds stood at 43% after the 2008 bailout when \u00a320bn was pumped into Lloyds and HBOS, the ailing bank it rescued at the height of the crisis. Osborne did not make any reference to RBS as he set out his plan for Lloyds on Monday. In March, in the runup to the election, he made clear that his focus would be on RBS should he be returned to the Treasury. \u201cThere are constraints around it, but it\u2019s certainly something I would want to get moving on in the summer after the election. I would want to see a review on a plan for disposal,\u201d Osborne said in March. The remaining stake in Lloyds also featured in election campaigning. In April, David Cameron said small investors would be able to buy up to \u00a34bn of Lloyds bank shares at a discount and there would be a \u201cloyalty bonus\u201d of one additional free share for every 10 shares investors still held after a year. No such detail was provided on Monday when the Treasury stated there would be a retail offering for investors, a pledge it has made on numerous occasions. The announcement followed the pledge by Osborne in his budget in March to sell off another \u00a39bn of shares in Lloyds in the next 12 months. Osborne first sold shares in Lloyds in September 2013 and again in March 2014 through placings with institutional investors, but in December he initiated a trading plan to dripfeed shares into the market for six months, which has now been extended to the end of the year. \u201cWe\u2019re determined to get on with the job of returning Lloyds to private ownership. That\u2019s why I\u2019m extending the plan for six months so that we can make even more progress in returning money to the taxpayer and paying down the national debt,\u201d said Osborne. Lloyds shares closed at 88.6p on Monday \u2013 above the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought the stake. The chancellor reiterated on Monday that shares would not be sold below this price. But shares in RBS were trading at 341p \u2013 below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought the stake. They are also below the 407p price published by the government in March 2013 as the average at which the shares were trading when they bought, rather than the actual prices paid. Any review on a disposal programme would likely consider what price might be acceptable to begin a sell-off.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Malaysia Airlines is \u201ctechnically bankrupt\u201d but can recover from a wretched 2014 to become south-east Asia\u2019s leading carrier, its new chief executive has said, after confirming plans to cut thousands of jobs. Christoph Mueller said the troubled airline, which had been in dire financial straits even before the MH370 and MH17 disasters last year, was making 6,000 of its 20,000 staff redundant and would sell two its A380 superjumbos to cut costs. Mueller, who joined from Irish carrier Aer Lingus, where he also axed jobs as part of a turnaround strategy, said the state-owned airline could break even by 2018. Malaysia Airlines has been propped up by cash from a government sovereign wealth fund, and will be restructured after parliamentary intervention to keep the airline going, allowing the remaining 14,000 staff to be re-employed by a new company running the airline from 1 September. The corporate rebranding to Malaysia Airlines Berhad [Limited]may also be accompanied by a more drastic image overhaul, Mueller hinted, although he would not be drawn on details. In his first public appearance since taking charge on 1 May, the German executive told a news conference: \u201cWe are technically bankrupt \u2026 The decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014.\u201d Malaysian Airlines has made a financial loss every year since 2011. Its last quarterly results were revealed in November 2014, as it delisted from the stock exchange when sovereign wealth fund Khazanah bought out the minority shareholders. Losses for the first nine months of the year had reached 1.3bn ringgit (\u00a3240m), compared with losses of around 827m ringgit for the same period in 2013. As the figures showed, the carrier\u2019s financial problems had taken root before the unprecedented disasters of 2014. AirAsia, the airline founded by QPR owner Tony Fernandes, which pioneered low-cost air travel in the region, grew up right under the nose of Malaysia Airlines at its Kuala Lumpur base. Meanwhile, the likes of Singapore Airlines and the Gulf carriers made heavy investments in premium, long-haul air travel that Malaysia would struggle to rival. By mid-2014, those business problems were overshadowed by tragedy as Malaysia Airline\u2019s name became synonymous with the disappearance of flight MH370 on 8 March, one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation, and causing the presumed deaths of 239 people who were en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The airline\u2019s reputation suffered further in its handling of the disaster as details of the confusion emerged. Despite a massive international search operation, followed by an ongoing trawl of a 120,000km2 search zone in the south Indian Ocean, no trace of the plane has been found. In July, the carrier was hit by a second disaster as a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot down over war-hit eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Mueller would not say whether the airline would change its name, although he admitted that the public would be reminded of its association with tragedy for as long as the search for Flight 370 continued, particularly in important markets such as Australia. He said he planned to \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d in 2015, stabilise the business next year and look for growth again by 2017. As part of the plan to cut costs overall by 20%, the airline will slim down its fleet, starting by selling two of the six A380s in its fleet. It will also refurbish its Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 long-haul planes, and cut some unprofitable international routes, while remaining \u201ca full-service international carrier connecting continents\u201d. Documents outlining the airline\u2019s overhaul make clear the airline\u2019s importance to the country, while alluding to the company\u2019s troubles over the years. The presentation says Malysia Airlines is \u201cmore than just a company; it is a critical enabler of national development and a national icon. But it must be anchored on operational excellence, financial sustainability, and the prudent use of public funds.\u201d Analysts were cautiously optimistic that the airline could be revived. Aviation consultant John Strickland said: \u201cMueller has done good work turning airlines round in Europe that have suffered from political interference with a poor economic backdrop, so he\u2019s had experience of making these kind of difficult decisions. \u201cThere\u2019s a good, growing marketplace and opportunity, but the low-cost competitors nearby and quality international rivals will make it difficult. He has to keep winning the hearts of minds of staff and the travelling public, and demonstrate against the backdrop of last year\u2019s tragedies that it is wholly safety focused, and the confidence of travellers is justified.\u201d Ken Odeluga, a senior market analyst at City Index, said Mueller\u2019s comments suggested he was \u201ctrying to afford himself maximum flexibility in the difficult months ahead\u201d. He said that there now appeared to be a will within government to tackle vested interests within Malaysia. \u201cMueller will have the ear of those strong enough to bulldozer parties which might attempt block the root-and-branch reform of the airline.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Worries about the unbalanced nature of Britain\u2019s economic recovery intensified on Monday after news that UK factories struggled to crank up output in May amid flagging overseas demand. After a sharp slowdown for the UK economy at the start of the year, analysts hope growth has bounced back in recent months. But the latest news from manufacturers suggested the sector was being left behind in any turnaround despite the government\u2019s ambitions to rebalance the economy towards more production and exports. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI report showed companies had scaled back hiring and remained largely dependent on domestic demand, largely driven by consumers, for what little growth there was last month. \u201cWe still see a bounce in overall GDP growth in the second quarter, but there is little evidence of such an improvement in manufacturing. As usual, the UK is reliant on services for growth,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC. The headline activity reading on the Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI modestly missed City expectations. It edged up to 52.0 from 51.8 in April, compared with a consensus forecast for 52.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said the strength of the pound was serving as a \u201cdouble-whammy for economic growth\u201d by constraining manufacturers\u2019 export performance and also driving a surge in cheap imports. \u201cExpectations of a broad rebound in UK economic growth during the second quarter of the year are called into question by these readings. Manufacturing looks on course to act as a minor drag on the economy, as the sector is hit by a combination of the strong pound and weak business investment spending,\u201d he said. Manufacturers lose momentum The pound had strengthened against other major currencies last month, boosted by a more decisive election outcome than investors had feared. But it weakened at the end of May on the back of growing market expectations the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for the rest of this year. Monday\u2019s manufacturing report reaffirmed that view and pushed the pound down to $1.5198 against the dollar, marking a return to its pre-election level. Pound weakens Although the PMI index has been above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for 26 months, it has softened recently, echoing other indicators suggesting tougher market conditions for manufacturers. The manufacturing trade group, EEF, has cut its growth forecast for the sector.

In a letter to the Financial Times, the energy companies also called for \u201cwidespread and effective\u201d carbon pricing to be part of the solution that emerges from crucial climate talks in Paris taking place at the end of the year. The letter is signed by Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Shell, Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, as well as their counterparts at BG Group, Eni, Statoil and Total. \u201cAs a group of business people, we are united in our concern about the challenge \u2013 and the threat \u2013 posed by climate change. We urge governments to take decisive action at December\u2019s UN summit. We are also united in believing such action should recognise the vital roles of natural gas and carbon pricing in helping to meet the world\u2019s demand for energy more sustainably.\u201d The six oil and gas companies press the case for getting out of coal and switching to natural gas \u2013 a lucrative part of their business model. Although they say renewable energy has \u201can increasing role to play\u201d, they think natural gas will help meet energy needs, arguing that governments must \u201cpursue all options to lower carbon while providing the energy the world needs to meet demand from a growing population seeking better living standards\u201d. Noticeable by their absence are any US firms. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the US\u2019s two largest oil companies, last week ruled out joining any corporate alliance on climate. Rex Tillerson, the chief executive and chair of ExxonMobil, told shareholders in Dallas, Texas, that the company was not going to \u201cfake it on climate change\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be disingenuous about it. We\u2019re not going to fake it. We\u2019re going to express a view that we have been very thoughtful about. We\u2019re going to express solutions and policy ideas that we think have merit. Speaking out to be speaking out about it doesn\u2019t seem particularly helpful to me,\u201d he said. The head of Chevron, John Watson, told investors: \u201cWe think we can make our own statements and our statements speak for themselves.\u201d The letter from the European energy companies is an unusual departure for the big energy firms, which usually prefer to work behind closed doors. The six energy bosses said they have written to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body that convenes the international talks between 196 nations. Their letter echoes the views of Van Beurden, who recently told the Guardian that hydrocarbons would be needed for \u201cyears to come\u201d. However, the Shell chief executive accepted that not all the world\u2019s fossil fuel resources can be burned unless some way is found to capture their emissions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sydney and parts of Melbourne are \u201cunequivocally\u201d experiencing a house price bubble, according to Treasury secretary John Fraser. Speaking at Senate estimates in Canberra on Monday, Fraser said he was concerned about the amount of money being poured into the housing market with interest rates at a record low of 2%. \u201cIt does worry me that the historically low level of interest rates are encouraging people to perhaps overinvest in housing,\u201d Fraser said. As Sydney saw an auction clearance rate of 87.4% at the weekend, Fraser said: \u201cWhen you look at the housing price bubble evidence, it\u2019s unequivocally the case in Sydney.\u201d It was also \u201ccertainly the case in higher priced areas in Melbourne\u201d, he said, but elsewhere in Australia the evidence was \u201cless compelling\u201d. Tony Abbott, when asked about Fraser\u2019s housing bubble comments during question time, said: \u201cAs someone who, along with the bank, owns a house in Sydney, I do hope our housing prices are increasing.\u201d The prime minister then clarified his remarks. \u201cI want housing to be affordable but nevertheless, I also want house prices to be modestly increasing,\u201d he said. Abbott said the important task was to improve the economy so people had jobs and the resources to become home owners. He said the government was also trying to make housing more available and ensure interest rates remained \u201clow and stable\u201d. Fraser\u2019s comments give an insight into his role as a member of the Reserve Bank of Australia board, which has voted twice this year to cut interests rates, including at its May meeting. If his concerns reflect a wider view on the board, it suggests Tuesday\u2019s monthly meeting of the board will not see another rate cut. However, his remarks will be tempered by figures released on Monday which showed that home prices dipped in May for the first time in six months, with Sydney\u2019s booming property market losing a bit of steam. Home values in Australia\u2019s capital cities fell by 0.9%, with drops recorded everywhere except Darwin and Canberra, the latest CoreLogic RP Data home value index showed. Sydney\u2019s home values fell 0.7%, with Melbourne down 1.7% and Hobart posting the biggest fall with a 2.7% slide. For the year to 31 May, home values were up by 9%, with the average property priced at $570,000. It came as approvals for the construction of new homes fell 4.4% in April, which was much worse than market expectations of a 1.5% fall. Over the 12 months to April, building approvals were up 16.6%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. Approvals for private sector houses rose 4.7% in the month, and the \u201cother dwellings\u201d category, which includes apartment blocks and townhouses, was down 15%. Commsec economist Savanth Sebastian said the steep fall reflected the volatility of the unit sector and expected one or two months of weakness before the sector bounced back. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significant in the result, the Reserve Bank will be comfortable there\u2019s plenty of building work being done,\u201d Sebastian said. Tighter lending restrictions may also have been a small drag on building approvals, he added. \u201cBanks are certainly being more responsible in terms of their lending policies, and I think that\u2019s showing up in the house price data as well.\u201d",
