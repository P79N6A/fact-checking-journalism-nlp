      "bodyText": "British factory orders grew in September at their weakest rate since April as rising import costs and uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations dented business confidence. The CBI said its monthly survey of manufacturers revealed a slowdown in orders that dragged back its measure for new contracts to +7 from +13 in August. The sector also suffered a slowdown in output growth over the past three months driven by the food and drink sector, which is among the industries suffering the most from rising import prices. CBI economist Anna Leach said the sector was still in rude health and likely to continue growing at above the historic trend for some time. \u201cManufacturers continue to report solid growth in output, while total order books and export order books are holding firm,\u201d she said. \u201cExpectations for selling prices were largely in line with the previous month, but price pressures do appear to have moderated somewhat since earlier in the year.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has slowed this year as the effect of a weaker pound pushed up inflation and weakened consumer demand. The Bank of England has nevertheless said it is likely to raise interest rates at its next meeting on 2 November in the expectation that full employment will raise wage rates and keep inflation above its 2% target next year. Bank chiefs have forecast that stronger exports will help offset weaker business investment and uncertain consumer demand. The CBI survey painted a rosier picture of manufacturing output this year than gloomy official figures from the Office for National Statistics, which have shown the sector contracting for most of the first half. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe CBI\u2019s total orders balance fell to its lowest level since April, but it still is consistent on past form with year-over-year growth in manufacturing output of about 4%. \u201cWe doubt that manufacturing is growing that quickly \u2013 the relationship between the survey and official data has been poor lately \u2013 but it\u2019s clear that the sector is is enjoying a rare good spell.\u201d The closely watched Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 56.9 last month from 55.3 in July, the second-highest level in more than three years, helped by the weak value of the pound.",

But instead of chatting over a drink they are smashing ping pong balls over a net. The venue is Bounce, a ping pong bar on the fringes of the financial district, and the number of stray balls in the air gives the impression that somewhere in the room a lottery draw machine is misfiring. The bar even employs runners to dash among the rows of tables scooping up balls with oversized fishing nets. \u201cI love the atmosphere. You can smash the ball around and nobody cares,\u201d says Dan Wright, an accountant on a work night out. \u201cIf you get hit in the face it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all part of the fun.\u201d It used to be the most exercise drinkers got was the trip to the bar for another round, but Bounce is among a new breed of bars and nightclubs changing the way Britons socialise by combining drinks with activities like table tennis, crazy golf and even axe-throwing. These new bars are seen as a positive trend for the UK\u2019s beleaguered pub and nightclub scene which has suffered as Britons avoid expensive rounds \u2013 the average price of a pint of beer in Britain is now \u00a33.60 \u2013 by buying discounted beer and wine alongside their weekly supermarket shop. Since the early 1970s nearly 30,000 pubs have called last orders for good with the 2007 smoking ban and the 2008 recession also blamed for the sector\u2019s declining popularity. The total is now down to fewer than 47,000, according to the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), with 21 typically closing every week. As well as filling a gap in the UK pub market, Bounce is targeting global expansion with plans for 20 sites. The company was founded by leisure entrepreneur Adam Breeden, who was also behind bowling venture All Star Lanes. Other brands are also springing up. \u201cPing pong is quite active and competitive. I associate darts and pool with fat guys drinking pints,\u201d says Mikey Televantou, head of marketing at Sink Pong, a table tennis venue in London\u2019s trendy East End. \u201cSometimes people turn up in their shorts and T-shirts at lunchtime, but it\u2019s mostly people in their work clothes.\u201d Beer and table tennis sounds like a dangerous combination for the uncoordinated but Televantou says accidents happen very occasionally: \u201cIt\u2019s gentler than competitive ping pong but sometimes people do slip or overstretch.\u201d These alternative nights out are part of the \u201cexperience economy\u201d \u2013 a phrase used to describe a shift in consumer behaviour from buying things to doing things. Official data shows that households spend less on clothes and food but more on holidays, cars, entertainment and eating out. \u201cFrom a consumer standpoint they want more from their entertainment budget,\u201d says Thomas Rose, who heads up the leisure and restaurant team at property firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a great deal of innovation in the leisure sector for the last 10-15 years and now we are seeing a wave of new concepts.\u201d Pubs that have tailored their beer offer with quality cask ales and trendy craft brands have been been able to cash in on the craft beer revolution. Rose points to other bars such as Flight Club, a fledgling London chain that claims to have reinvented darts with dart-tracking technology, as putting a fresh twist on pub culture. \u201cWhen you think of darts you tend too think of old men but when I went, 50% of the crowd were 18-35-year-old women,\u201d says Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s not slow and boring because you don\u2019t have to do the adding up \u2013 the tech does it for you.\u201d There is also a burgeoning crazy-golf scene with outfits such as Junkyard Golf Club and Swingers proving a big hit with millennials keen on Instagram worthy nights out. \u201cThe days when people were content to go to the pub and just have a chat have gone,\u201d said Chris Legh, one of the co-founders of Junkyard Golf Club, which is opening a third venue in Oxford next month. \u201cPeople want to be engrossed in an activity rather than sitting across a pub table ignoring their friends and looking at their mobiles.\u201d Rose says his property firm is being contacted all the time by entrepreneurs with \u201ccrazy\u201d bar themes up their sleeves. \u201cBut if you had said to me 10 years ago people would be opening table tennis bars I would have thought you were mad,\u201d he adds. \u201cPubs are having to adapt to changing tastes.\u201d But if you would prefer the kind of pub where there is no risk of a ping pong or golf ball plopping into your glass, you are not alone. \u201cIt feels quite American in here with the loud music and modern furniture, says Tarik Miri, a Belgian fintech worker also on a night out at Bounce. \u201cI love traditional British pubs. They are friendly and I like the mindset \u2013 the wooden tables and old school feeling.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has launched an online grocery service that will enable shoppers to have their dinner delivered to their front door within an hour. The Guardian revealed in April M&amp;S was working on an online food service, and on Friday the store launched trials in London and Woodley, near Reading. The first trial is based at its Camden store in north London and offers home delivery within one- and two-hour slots within a three-mile radius. A limited range of ready meals including Thai green curry and pizzas can be delivered within an hour, but if shoppers want to add groceries to their baskets, delivery time is two hours. The Reading store has a collection-only service with a two-hour turnaround for orders. Both trials are open only to members of M&amp;S\u2019s Sparks loyalty scheme. The minimum order is \u00a310. While Britons may have fallen out of love with the M&amp;S clothing range in recent years, they have been flocking to its food aisles to pick up ingredients for an evening meal rather than do a big weekly shop. M&amp;S has been selling a selection of party food and alcohol on its website for some time, but this is the first time its wider grocery range, including staples such as bread and milk, have been available online. The number of lines on sale is 4,100. \u201cWe have started two small food online trials with selected Sparks members as we explore what works for our customers,\u201d an M&amp;S spokesman said. John Mercer, a retail analyst at Fung Global Retail and Technology, said the retailer had chosen a model like UberEat\u2019s rather than the traditional route taken by the major supermarkets, which requires big basket sizes to be successful. \u201cI think it is sensible that M&amp;S has held off until now because the major grocery retailers have found the economics of home delivery to be very costly,\u201d he said. Until now, selling food online has not made sense for M&amp;S as its customers do not typically spend enough on each visit to make the service viable. But the trial is tapping into a food home delivery boom as Britons increasingly use app-based services such as Deliveroo, Just Eat, UberEats to have meals delivered. There is no delivery charge for orders which are being handled by gig economy courier firm Gophr. An M&amp;S spokeswoman said Gophr had been selected as its delivery partner following a \u201crigorous selection process\u201d. M&amp;S boss Steve Rowe concluded it could no longer ignore the fastest growing section of the UK\u2019s \u00a3180bn grocery market as new delivery services, such as AmazonFresh, which allows shoppers to order groceries at lunchtime and get the delivery in time for dinner, revolutionise the way Britain buys food. The high-street store is different from other food retailers as it stocks just 7,000 products, compared with Tesco\u2019s 40,000. It also focuses on own-brand goods with only a limited number of big-name brands. It is not clear how the retailer would overcome these hurdles if it offered customers a full grocery outlet in the future. \u201cThe economics of food online are not straightforward and it is not something that we are going to rush into until we have substantial customer insight and a better understanding of what is right for M&amp;S and right for our customers,\u201d Rowe said earlier this year.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the major developments today. Investors were in cautious mood as they awaited the contents of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech in Florence. We have live updates on the speech here. The pound is currently down against both the euro and the dollar. Losses against the dollar have accelerated, with the pound down 0.6% dipping just below the $1.35 mark. Against the euro, the pound is down 0.8% at \u20ac1.1275. So it seems traders are not feeling confident about Britain\u2019s Brexit position, although the reaction to the speech by EU officials will be crucial. European markets are mixed. The FTSE 100 has reversed those small losses earlier on and is now up 0.6% or 45 points at 7,308. In the eurozone, better-than-expected PMI surveys for the manufacturing and services sector suggested growth in the region picked up to 0.7% in the third quarter from 0.6% in the second. The big corporate news was the shock decision by Transport for London to deny Uber a new licence to operate in London. Uber said it would challenge the decision. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for joining us and for all your comments. Have a great weekend, and please join us again on Monday. AM US markets have opened slightly down: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 22,345 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,497 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 6,402 London\u2019s black cab drivers have praised TfL and the London mayor Sadiq Khan, over the Uber decision. Jim Kelly, chairman of of London\u2019s Unite union black cab section, said it was the right thing to do to put the safety of passengers above the corporate interests of Uber. No one is above the law and today\u2019s decision will be welcomed by London\u2019s trusted professional black cab drivers. It signals that the mayor of London and Transport for London are not prepared to allow London to become the \u2018wild west\u2019 of the cab trade and put passengers at risk. In the coming weeks Uber will no doubt throw all its legal and corporate lobbying might to overturn this decision. We would urge the mayor of London and Transport for London to stand firm and continue to stand up for the safety of Londoners and the capital\u2019s trusted cabbies. Business lobby group the CBI has issued a statement in support of Uber, after Transport for London said it would not renew the taxi company\u2019s London licence: Tom Thackray, the CBI\u2019s innovation director: Broadening consumer choice through innovation is an important part of our economy and has created new opportunities that are valued by many. It\u2019s not in the interests of our economy, people in London and in this case, drivers, to restrict new products and services. Both Uber and TfL recognise the vital importance of customer safety. Reaching a sensible agreement that allows services to continue will matter to the millions of consumers and thousands of drivers who use the app. Figures published earlier by the Office for National Statistics show Britain is more appealing as a holiday destination since the sharp fall in the value of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Overseas tourists made a record 4 million visits to the UK in July, an increase of 6% on last year. The amount they spent rose by 3% to \u00a32.7bn. European and American visitors came in the greatest numbers, encouraged by the strength of both the euro and the dollar against the pound. Guy Ellison from Investec Wealth and Investment said the record tourist numbers would have boosted UK attractions over the summer: The pick-up in in-bound tourism is welcome, with London likely to have been the prime beneficiary. It was always anticipated that in-bound tourism would see a material pick up in 2017 thanks to the sharp devaluation of sterling, though the terrorist attacks in London undoubtedly deterred some visitors. Expect the international hotel brands to have benefitted from stronger occupancy, with perhaps some spill-over impact to the UK\u2019s independent hotel names and the likes of Whitbread\u2019s Premier Inn. Merlin, with its cluster of tourist attractions in London (The Eye, Tussauds etc.) and other sited within range of the capital (Legoland) should also have benefitted from a pick-up in visitor numbers \u2013 though the less clement weather over August may have dampened demand for outdoor attractions. Over to Greece now, where the German election over the weekend will be closely watched amid mounting anticipation the outcome will likely affect Athens\u2019 bid for debt relief. Helena Smith reports. The last time Germany went to the polls in 2013, Greece dominated the agenda. Greece\u2019s epic struggle to remain in the eurozone, its dependency on bailout funds and the saga of enforcing often draconian reforms, electrified public debate. This time even the rightwing, anti-euro Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party isn\u2019t bothering much about Greece. But the election is being closely followed in Athens where the governing Syriza party is openly backing the leftwing Die Linke. \u201cThe party of the German left, Die Linke, has been \u2026 the force that in the most difficult moments for our country stood by the Greek people irrespective of political cost,\u201d Syriza said in a statement. \u201cIn such critical elections for the future, not only of Germany but the European Union, with the threat of a reinforced far right as never before in Germany, those who demand an end to the pan-European policies of austerity \u2026 must be supported.\u201d There are fears that the result could impact on the country\u2019s ability to achieve a debt write off, and recover economically, if conservative voices among Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, and the Liberal Free Democrats \u2013 the CDU\u2019s likely coalition partner - are strengthened by the vote. While TfL revealed it would not be renewing Uber\u2019s London licence, the CBI published its latest industrial trends report. The business lobby group said the pace of growth in UK manufacturing output eased in the third quarter, but the outlook \u201cremains strong\u201d. From the report: The survey of 429 manufacturers found that while output growth slowed last quarter, largely driven by the food and drink sector, the rate of growth remained well above the long-run average. Respondents expect output growth to bounce back next quarter, broadly matching the robust pace seen in the three months to July and August. Both total orders books and export order books remained strong, although total order books softened somewhat on August. The deterioration was relatively broad-based with 9 of the 17 sub-sectors reporting a decline relative to August. Here is the full statement on the Uber decision from Sadiq Khan, mayor of London: Some Twitter reaction to the Uber decision: Uber says it will \u201cimmediately\u201d challenge the decision by Transport for London to deny the cab company a new licence to operate in the capital. Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber in London: 3.5 million Londoners who use our app, and more than 40,000 licensed drivers who rely on Uber to make a living, will be astounded by this decision. By wanting to ban our app from the capital Transport for London and the Mayor have caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice. If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport. To defend the livelihoods of all those drivers, and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use our app, we intend to immediately challenge this in the courts. Read our full story on the decision here: Major news from Uber... the taxi hailing company has been denied a new licence to operate in London, on the grounds that it is not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d operator according to Transport for London. The current licence expires on 30 September but Uber has 21 days to appeal and can continue to operate until that process expires. TfL says \u201cUber\u2019s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications\u201d, such as reporting serious criminal offences, obtaining medical certificates and other issues. The transport group has published its full statement on Twitter: Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has used a keynote speech at Trinity College in Dublin to warn about the dangers of youth unemployment and urge action. He pointed out that having reached a peak of 24% in 2013, youth unemployment fell back to about 19% last year. But that is still four percentage points higher than it was in 2007, when the financial crisis began to unfold. We have seen how in several countries the weight of the crisis has fallen disproportionately on the young people, leaving a legacy of failed hopes, anger and ultimately mistrust in the values of our society and in the identity of our democracy. Some say that a more equitable distribution of income and wealth is the answer and that it would bring those who have lost out from globalisation back into our compact. But that cannot be enough for the young people who are the future of our democracies. They do not want to live on subsidies. They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities. Today after the crisis, governments know how to respond to their quest, and how to create an environment where their hopes have a chance. They should do so: for the future of their countries\u2019 youth and of their democracy. The Guardian\u2019s politics blog is up and running. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is providing live updates in the build-up to Theresa May\u2019s crucial speech in Florence. Follow the blog here: It\u2019s fairly quiet this morning on Europe\u2019s major markets as investors take a breather ahead of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech this afternoon. The latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,251 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 12,610 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,282 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 22,521 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.02% at 10,295 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 383 Traders are in cautious mood ahead of Theresa May\u2019s crucial speech this afternoon. The pound is now down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1312. Meanwhile earlier gains against the dollar have evaporated, with the pound down just a touch by 0.03% at $1.3573. Analysts are expecting potentially big moves in the pound - in either direction - later in the trading session, once May\u2019s speech is underway and reaction among EU officials becomes clear. The eurozone economy ended the third quarter on a high note, with private sector accelerating in September according to the IHS Markit flash PMI survey. Authors of the report said the surveys, which look at the performance of the services and manufacturing sectors, suggested eurozone growth picked up to 0.7% in the third quarter, from 0.6% in the second. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: The eurozone economy ended the summer with a burst of activity, with the PMI signalling renewed impetus to already-impressive rates of growth of output, order books and employment during September. The survey data point to 0.7% GDP growth for the third quarter, with accelerating momentum boding well for a buoyant end to the year. The headline eurozone PMI numbers: Eurozone flash manufacturing PMI rose to 58.2 in September from 57.4 in August. It beat expectations of 57.1 Growth also accelerated in the services sector, with the eurozone flash services PMI climbing to 55.6 this month from 54.7 in August. Economists were predicting no change The relative strength of both sectors pushed the eurozone flash composite PMI to 56.7 in September, from 55.7 in August, again beating expectations German\u2019s reputation as an industrial powerhouse was well earned in September as the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in nearly six-and-a-half years in September. That\u2019s according to the IHS Markit flash manufacturing PMI. The services sector was also stronger than expected this month. The headline numbers: German flash manufacturing PMI rose to 60 in September from 59.3 in August. Growth had been expected to dip slightly, with economists forecasting a headline number of 59 Growth in the services sector also picked up, with the German flash services PMI rising to 55.6 from 53.5. That beat expectations of 53.8 The two surveys combined pushed the German flash composite PMI to a near six-and-a-half-year high of 57.8 from 55.8 in August. Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit puts the numbers in context: September\u2019s PMI survey showed Germany\u2019s private sector economy in rude health, highlighting strong broad-based growth in both business activity and employment. Our forecast of 0.7% GDP growth in the third quarter remains well within the realms of possibility. Closely-watched business surveys for the French manufacturing and services sectors have easily beaten expectations. The IHS Markit flash PMI surveys for September suggest the private sector in Europe\u2019s second largest economy ended the third quarter on a high. The services sector was particularly strong. Here are the headline numbers (anything above 50 signals growth): French flash services PMI jumped to 57.1 in September from 54.9 in August. Economists were forecasting weaker growth at 54.8 French flash manufacturing PMI rose to 56 in September from 55.8 in the previous month. That beat economists\u2019 forecasts of 55.5 The strength in both sectors pushed the French composite flash PMI, which combines both, to 57.2 in September from 55.2 in August, again beating expectations Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit: According to the latest flash PMI data, the French private sector\u2019s 2017 revival continued in September. Indeed, the resurgence gained momentum with growth of output and new orders hitting near six-and-a-half year highs. Encouragingly, private sector growth appears to be broad-based, with similar rates of expansion recorded in both the manufacturing and services sectors. Asian markets are largely in the red after North Korea threatened to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean. Earlier the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said President Trump would \u201cpay dearly\u201d for his threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the regime. Here is how it\u2019s looking in Asia: Nikkei: -0.25% at 20,296 Topix: -0.3% at 1,665 Hang Seng: -0.7% at 27,907 Kospi 200: -0.5% at 317 Sensex: -1.1% at 32,029 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is steady this morning ahead of Theresa May\u2019s highly anticipated Brexit speech in Florence. It is currently trading down a touch against the dollar, at $1.3566. The content of the Prime Minister\u2019s speech this afternoon will have a major bearing on whether or not the pound can hold on to its recent strength. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC, explains: Whether the pound can continue its recent rebound is likely to depend on how markets receive Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s speech in Florence later today, when she is expected to put forward the UK government\u2019s latest proposals to move the currently stalled talks with the EU. She is expected to make proposals on the rights of EU citizens, as well as making a budget proposal that will ensure that there is no budget shortfall for the remainder of the current EU budget period, which goes up to 2020. The offer is likely to be conditional on continued transitional access to the single market and customs union over the same period, while there could be a request to open talks on trade, something that in the case of the Irish border is interlinked. A transition arrangement would also help in buying more time to come to a more comprehensive deal. If the markets like what they hear and there isn\u2019t a negative response from the EU then the recent rally in the pound could extend further. Also coming up today... 8.00am BST: Flash PMI surveys for manufacturing and services in France. The reports are expected to show reasonable growth in the private sector in September, albeit at a slower pace than in August. 8.30am BST: Flash PMI surveys for manufacturing and services in Germany. The equivalent PMI reports for Europe\u2019s largest economy are expected to show a slight easing of the pace of growth in September. 9.00am BST: Flash eurozone PMI surveys for manufacturing and services will provide an overview of how the private sector in the single-currency bloc performed in September. 9.30am BST: Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, will give a keynote speech at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. As ever, economists and investors will be listening out for any hints on the pace and timing of monetary stimulus withdrawal. 11am BST: The CBI\u2019s industrial trends report for September will provide the latest snapshot of how the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is performing in the face of Brexit negotiation uncertainty.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair was branded a \u201cdisgrace\u201d by a group of pilots after missing a deadline to respond to their demands for improved employment terms, as the risk of a full-blown labour dispute has now spread to cabin crew. As discontent among Ryanair staff threatened to boil over, chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary reportedly issued an internal memo apologising for the company\u2019s rostering error, which forced it to cancel up to 50 flights a day, affecting 315,000 passengers. \u201cI want to say personally, to each and every one of you who work in Ryanair, I\u2019m sorry for the mess that we have created over the past week over the rosters,\u201d he said, according to the Irish Independent. But a draft letter circulated among pilots based at airports across Europe criticised O\u2019Leary\u2019s overall handling of the affair, which has seen him threaten to force them to defer time off. In a separate letter sent earlier this week, pilots from more than 30 of Ryanair\u2019s European bases had given the Irish airline until 10am on Friday to address concerns about their employment terms. The group, who have hired professional negotiators, listed demands including new employment contracts to be negotiated by 1 January 2018 and common working conditions throughout the carrier\u2019s network. Many of Ryanair\u2019s pilots are employed via temporary agency contracts, among the factors that allow the no-frills airline to keep costs down. The letter said agreeing to change this model would \u201chelp keep our planes in the air\u201d and make sure that \u201ccancellations will be minimised\u201d. But two pilots familiar with efforts to negotiate with Ryanair said the company had ignored the ultimatum, allowing the deadline to pass without a response. The Guardian has seen an early draft of a second letter that was due to be sent to Ryanair on Friday, criticising O\u2019Leary\u2019s handling of the dispute. \u201cAs a pilot group we regret that you are not willing to solve the problems Ryanair is facing now,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe offered our help, however you prefer to cancel flights and leave the passengers out in the cold. We do not understand why Ryanair management sees us as the enemy when we are actually colleagues.\u201d The letter also questioned comments O\u2019Leary made at this week\u2019s annual general meeting, when he accused pilots of being \u201cprecious\u201d and questioned the difficulty of their job. \u201cManagement should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d pilots said. \u201cWhat you say at press conferences is a disgrace to all employees and contractors. Ryanair has been doing well for so many years and that is all because of us.\u201d Ryanair said: \u201cOur crews have confirmed they sent no such letter,\u201d without saying which letter it was referring to. One ex-Ryanair pilot said many former colleagues were unimpressed with the company\u2019s offer of a tax-free bonus of up to \u00a312,000 if they fly during their time off, to avoid further cancellations during the rest of the year. \u201c[O\u2019Leary] wants to buy himself into January and do it as cheap as possible, the way he always does,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course \u20ac10,000 is not nothing. But this is an airline that\u2019s planning to report close to \u20ac1.5bn profit. He wants to buy himself out of this crisis for pennies.\u201d Cabin crew have also been emboldened by the dispute with pilots and are set to take advantage of a rare opportunity to seek improvements to their terms while Ryanair is vulnerable due to potential impact of any further cancellations. Irish law allows Ryanair to avoid recognising trade unions but the company recently suffered a setback when it lost a labour rights battle in the European court of justice, which ruled staff could pursue legal claims in the country where they are based. Several sources among pilots and cabin crew said they have now begun forming secret informal unions via social media, to avoid repercussions that might affect their job prospects. One invite-only Facebook group, Ryanair Cabin Crew United, has gathered 3,400 members, verified as genuine current or former staff by their \u201ccrew code\u201d. The group\u2019s founders told the Guardian they are preparing an open letter to the company demanding improved working conditions. They are taking advice from trade unions in several countries including Italy and Spain after losing patience with O\u2019Leary\u2019s attitude towards them. \u201cThis guy has to understand that the limit has passed,\u201d said one. \u201cWe want to stop this ridiculous circus.\u201d Their demands are expected to include full employment contracts at local level, the removal of sales target for items such as scratchcards and perfume and changes to fees for training courses.",

      "bodyText": "Overseas visitors flocked to Britain in record numbers in July and spent more than ever in response to the improved spending power offered by the low pound. Non-UK residents made 4m visits to Britain in July, an increase of 6% on last year and spent \u00a32.7bn, up 3% on July 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase in foreign visitors during the peak summer months failed to match the rise around the Easter period, when their numbers and the amount they spent increased by about 20% on the year before. The surge in tourist numbers during the spring has kept the annual rate of growth at 8%, but analysts believe there will be no repeat of the double digit increases seen earlier in the year because of terror attacks in Manchester and London and the recent weakness of the dollar, which has deterred some American tourists from travelling to London. Guy Ellison, an analyst at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, which monitors leisure firms such as London Eye and Madame Tussaud\u2019s owner Merlin, said: \u201cThe pick up in inbound tourism is welcome, with London likely to have been the prime beneficiary. \u201cIt was always anticipated that inbound tourism would see a material pick up in 2017 thanks to the sharp devaluation of sterling, though the terrorist attacks in London undoubtedly deterred some visitors,\u201d he said. A surge in numbers throughout the year has buoyed Britain\u2019s tourism and services industries, at a time when uncertainty created by the EU referendum has damaged the confidence of UK consumers and businesses. Brexit triggered a 20% slump in the value of the pound last year against most major currencies that has since waned, especially against the dollar where there is only a 13% drop since last year. The pound\u2019s fall made most holiday and business trips to the UK more attractive, with European visitors coming in the largest numbers, up 240,000 to 2.5 million. The growth in tourists from June to July was helped by a surge in numbers from the rest of the world, which passenger flight records show came mostly from China and east Asia. Between June and July the number of non-European and US tourists increased from 570,000 to 840,000. However, the overall figures was pulled back by the number of American tourists, which stalled at 650,000. Tourism agency VisitBritain said last year that it expected overseas visitors would spend \u00a324.1bn in 2017, up 8% on 2016. But while earnings growth was 18% in March and April, it has since declined to between 2% and 4%. In the last year, holiday visits to the UK were up 12% to 1.78m. Business visits were down by 1.7% at 710,000. Staycations were also a feature of the summer months after a fall in the pound hit the number UK residents making visits abroad. Britons travelling to Europe and beyond fell to 6.9m, a 2% decrease when compared with July 2016. Spending by UK residents on foreign holidays also declined by 2% to \u00a34.5bn on the same month a year before. In some airports during July, British holidaymakers heading to Europe were offered record low foreign exchange rates. In one airport customers could only get 88 euro cents for every pound. Vistors from the eurozone have seen the pound fall from above \u20ac1.40 in 2015 to \u20ac1.12 this week. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club said the combination of people staying at home for holidays and the influx of foreign tourists helped to bolster the economy. \u201cIt is notable that there have been reports that retail sales were boosted in August by more people taking holidays at home as well as spending by tourists,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "KPMG has been cleared of any wrongdoing over its auditing of HBOS, which was rescued by Lloyds during the height of the 2008 crisis, after accounting regulators concluded the accountancy firm could not have foreseen the bank\u2019s problems. The accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), announced that it had closed an investigation into KPMG which was sparked by pressure from MPs on the Treasury select committee in 2015. The FRC concluded \u201cthere was not a realistic prospect that a tribunal would make an adverse finding against KPMG in respect of the matters within the scope of the investigation\u201d. KMPG said it was pleased with the findings. \u201cThe firm\u2019s work did not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit, the test that a tribunal would apply,\u201d the FRC said. The investigation was into the 2007 accounts of HBOS and looked at the description of the bank as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d. The accounts were published in February 2008 \u2013 barely six months before it was taken over by Lloyds in the panic that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The extreme funding conditions that arose in October 2008 were not anticipated, the FRC said. \u201cHBOS did not expect market conditions to worsen and judged that it would be able to fund itself. The auditor considered and accepted this conclusion. HBOS published its audited financial statements in February 2008 on that basis. The evidence of market conditions at that time did not show this decision of HBOS or the auditor\u2019s assessment of it to be unreasonable at the time,\u201d the FRC said. The collapse of HBOS and problems at other banks sparked scrutiny of the audit profession and the FRC said that next month it would publish a report on how auditing had changed since the crisis. MPs had called for the regulator to investigate after the publication in November of the formal investigation into what went wrong at HBOS. That also sparked an investigation into the individuals at the bank at the time, and those investigations are thought to be continuing. KPMG said: \u201cWe have always maintained that our audit was robust and undertaken in accordance with the regulations and practice of the time.\u201d It added: \u201cThe collapse of HBOS and other examples of corporate failure and fraud in the last decade have highlighted a gap between what society expects of an audit and what an audit has been designed to do. Since 2008, whilst we recognise that there is more to be done, we have worked hard to contribute positively to this debate and have explored ways to close the expectation gap, for example, by offering extended audit opinions which give a view on corporate risks.\u201d",
