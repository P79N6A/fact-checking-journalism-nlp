Wrestling with Stelios has tended to be part of the job description when running the budget carrier, but that perk now comes on top of a mounting list of fiddly tasks. We will find out more about them at the company\u2019s final results this week, when current chief exec Carolyn McCall sets the doors to manual before her disembarkation. McCall will hand the controls to Lundgren just as the UK aviation industry is peering through the fog to work out what its future relationship with the EU will look like following Brexit. Analysts at Investec say that, given the significance of the UK to the European aviation market, they reckon a special case will be made, but add a note of caution that easyJet is the firm most at risk if something goes wrong. Lundgren also needs to oversee the integration of parts of the recently acquired Air Berlin business, plus there\u2019s the hunt to buy bits of Italy\u2019s insolvent airline Alitalia, and collapsed rival Monarch Airlines. Meanwhile, there are concerns about the current state of the budget airline sector, on the back of a weaker pound and recent terrorist attacks. Developing. Hill set to kick up about kicking the FOBT habit Fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) are said to be the \u201ccrack cocaine of gambling\u201d and some problem gamblers certainly find the machines extremely addictive. But the gambling industry itself also finds FOBTs pretty moreish: companies have become hooked on the profits these machines have generated, and are effectively arguing that the industry as we know it could not survive without them. Late last month it was announced that the maximum stake that can be gambled on FOBTs would be cut, after the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport admitted that existing limits, which allow gamblers to bet up to \u00a3300 a minute, were, er, inappropriate. The maximum bet will be cut from \u00a3100 to between \u00a32 and \u00a350, and you\u2019ll be astonished to learn that the bookies, who warn that shops will close if maximum stakes are cut, will lobby for the \u00a350 option during a 12-week consultation period ending in January. All of which brings us to the results of bookmaker William Hill this week \u2013 in its first outing since the announcement. Expect grumbling about its fix being taken away. Cruddas recouped CMC losses. Punters may not Entanglements with financial spread-betting firms have always proved more lucrative for the companies\u2019 founders than their clients. IG Group made Stuart Wheeler so rich that he could afford to spend millions restoring crumbling old relics (Kent\u2019s Chilham Castle in 2002 and the Conservative party in 2001, the old gag goes), while even industry minnow London Capital Group made Simon Denham rich enough to buy the former home of a former music star (Liam Howlett of the Prodigy). Peter Cruddas, the founder of CMC Markets, is the richest of them all, having supposedly once been a billionaire (although he\u2019s scraping by on much less these days). His vast wealth took a bit of a hit after the company floated, with the shares now 30% cheaper than when they listed on the stock exchange in February 2016. Even so, the firm has had a decent run during 2017, which means Cruddas has made back some of his losses. That recent upwards trajectory of the stock suggests investors are expecting cheery news when CMC unveils interim results this week \u2013 although it is probably sage not to bet on that. What Cruddas and his ilk often forget to mention is this: only about 20% of spread-betting punters actually make money. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Construction has begun on a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) scheme to reclaim land from the sea around Monaco so that more luxury apartments can be built for the thousands of extra millionaires expected to move to the principality in the next 10 years. Nearly 35 in every 100 Monaco residents are millionaires and more of the global super-rich want to join them. Around 2,700 more are expected to call Monaco home by 2026, according to research by estate agent Knight Frank, taking the total to 16,100 out of a total population of under 38,000. But the sovereign city-state \u2013 which is only slightly bigger than Regent\u2019s Park in London \u2013 has run out of space for those seeking the \u201cfiscal advantages\u201d that the tax haven offers. To attract the world\u2019s wealthy, Prince Albert II, the reigning monarch, has approved the \u201coffshore urban extension project\u201d, which will add six hectares (15 acres) to Monaco\u2019s 202 hectares. This will allow the creation of 120 luxury homes selling for more than $100,000 per sq metre \u2013 more expensive than One Hyde Park in London and 15 Central Park West in Manhattan. The new Portier Cove ecological neighbourhood, near Casino de Monte-Carlo, is regarded as vital for the continued growth of the principality; according to state statistics body L\u2019Institut mon\u00e9gasque de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques (IMSEE), not one new-build apartment went up for sale last year. Previous plans for a larger reclamation scheme were dropped after the financial crisis and environmental concerns. But Bouygues, the construction company behind the project, has promised there will be no detrimental effect on the environment. Important species on the seabed have been moved to a new reserve and the company said 3D-printed artificial coral reefs on the 18 trapezoid reinforced concrete caissons used to create the boundary of the new land would provide an artificial reef for wildlife. Edward de Mallet Morgan, global super prime residential partner at Knight Frank, said huge demand and a severe lack of supply had sent Monaco prices \u201cthrough the roof\u201d. A cool $1m in Monaco will buy 17 sq m of prime residential property, less than a third of the space it would buy in Paris and just over half of the 30m of space it would command in prime central London. Only 70 of the Portier Cove apartments \u2013 some of which are designed by The Shard architect Renzo Piano \u2013 will go on sale (the others being retained by the developer). Mallet Morgan said that by the time the development was finished \u201cwho knows what stratosphere Monaco\u2019s prices will have reached\u201d. \u201cSuch is the demand for new waterfront homes that price will be little deterrent to buyers \u2013 and their tax advisers - who are thinking ahead with wealth preservation in mind for future generations of their families,\u201d he said. Most of his clients looking to buy in Monaco have vastly more than seven-digit fortunes. Knight Frank\u2019s research shows that 1,220 of Monaco\u2019s residents were worth more than $30m [ultra-high net worth individuals in 2016 \u2013 a 10% increase on the 2015 figure. That works out at 320 ultra-high net worth individuals per 10,000 people, compared with two in every 10,000 in the US. Among the wealthy already based in Monaco are Sir Philip Green\u2019s wife, Tina, who has been resident in the Monegasque principality since 1998. The Greens say the companies behind their retail empire are based in offshore locations because of their \u201cstrong regulation\u201d, not for tax reasons. Formula One drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button and tennis superstar Novak Djokovic also live in Monaco. Mallet Morgan explained the reason that most clients wanted to buy in Monaco: \u201cIn their private lives and business lives, they naturally want to structure themselves so that they are only paying as much tax as they need to. You can\u2019t avoid that Monaco is a tax haven, you can dress it up as a low-tax environment, but it is a tax haven with a lot of tax breaks for families, businesses and importantly inheritance tax. \u201cInheritance tax is important for a lot of families who have developed wealth over generations, because here there is no tax at all on passing wealth over to children.\u201d The inheritance tax break applies to assets held in Monaco or overseas. There is no personal income tax in Monaco. In the UK, income above \u00a3150,000 is taxed at 45%. Companies incorporated in Monaco are exempt from taxes if most of their business is based in the principality. In order to apply for Monaco residency, applicants must open a Monaco bank account and deposit at least \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3440,000). Nick Edmiston, the founder and chairman of superyacht builder Edmiston &amp; Co, said a high sense of personal security was a big draw for the super-rich. \u201cYou can walk around wearing expensive jewellery and feel safe,\u201d said Edmiston, who has lived in Monaco since 1989. \u201cMany wealthy people are used to always being surrounded by bodyguards but that\u2019s not necessary in Monaco.\u201d However, Mallet Morgan warned rich prospective buyers that they were not likely to get much space for their money. \u201cYou can pay the best part of \u20ac500,000-\u20ac750,000 for a parking space,\u201d he said, and a \u20ac6m two-bed apartment is going to be \u201cquite pokey compared to London\u201d. But a lot of people commute to London or Paris. \u201cIt is easy to go anywhere from Nice airport, which is a short helicopter ride away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can easily go and have a meeting with your trustees in Geneva, and then go to the Opera in Vienna that evening.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2017.

      "bodyText": "Britain successfully lobbied Brazil on behalf of BP and Shell to address the oil giants\u2019 concerns over Brazilian taxation, environmental regulation and rules on using local firms, government documents reveal. The UK\u2019s trade minister travelled to Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Sa\u0303o Paulo in March for a visit with a \u201cheavy focus\u201d on hydrocarbons, to help British energy, mining and water companies win business in Brazil. Greg Hands met with Paulo Pedrosa, Brazilian deputy minister for mines and energy, and \u201cdirectly\u201d raised the concerns of UK-based oil firms Shell, BP and Premier Oil over \u201ctaxation and environmental licensing\u201d. Pedrosa said he was pressing his counterparts in the Brazilian government on the issues, according to a British diplomatic telegram obtained by Greenpeace. The Department for International Trade (DIT) initially released an unredacted version of the telegram under freedom of information rules to Greenpeace\u2019s investigative unit, Unearthed, with sensitive passages highlighted. Shortly after, the department issued a second version of the document, with the same passages redacted. Greenpeace accused the department of acting as a \u201clobbying arm of the fossil fuel industry\u201d. The UK government denies it was lobbying to weaken the environmental licensing regime, although the lobbying drive appears to have borne fruit. In August, Brazil proposed a multibillion-dollar tax relief plan for offshore drilling, and in October BP and Shell won the bulk of deep-water drilling licenses in a government auction. Rebecca Newsom, senior political adviser at Greenpeace, said: \u201cThis is a double embarrassment for the UK government. Liam Fox\u2019s trade minister has been lobbying the Brazilian government over a huge oil project that would undermine the climate efforts Britain made at the UN summit in Bonn. \u201cIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Fox\u2019s department tried to cover it up and hide its actions from the public, but failed comically.\u201d The document also reveals that the UK pressured Brazil to relax its requirements for oil and gas operators to use a certain amount of Brazilian staff and supply chain companies. British diplomats described the weakening of the so-called local content requirements as a \u201cprincipal objective\u201d because BP, Shell and Premier Oil would be \u201cdirect British beneficiaries\u201d of the changes. The UK\u2019s drive to soften the requirements continued on the day after the meeting between Hands and Pedrosa, with a senior DIT official leading a seminar on the subject at the headquarters of Brazil\u2019s oil and gas regulator. The UK government has come under fire in the past for providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support for Brazil\u2019s scandal-hit state oil firm Petrobras via the UK\u2019s credit export agency. The UK\u2019s continued oil lobbying efforts in Brazil emerged days after British ministers were touting the UK\u2019s leadership on cutting carbon emissions at international climate talks in Bonn. Claire Perry, the climate change minister, told the summit: \u201cwe are taking our commitments under the Paris agreement very seriously and we are taking action.\u201d A DIT spokesman said: \u201cDIT is responsible for encouraging international investment opportunities for UK businesses, whilst respecting fully local and international environmental standards. The UK oil and gas industry and supply chain supports thousands of jobs and provides \u00a319bn in goods exports alone. \u201cHowever, it is absolutely not true that our ministers lobbied to loosen environmental restrictions in Brazil \u2013 the meeting was about improving the environmental licensing process, ensuring a level playing field for both domestic and foreign companies, and in particular helping to speed up the licensing process and make it more transparent, which in turn will protect environmental standards.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The editor-in-chief of the Mirror titles has indicated that their parent group will face deeper job losses across its 5,000-plus workforce if it fails to seal a \u00a3130m deal to buy Richard Desmond\u2019s Express and Star newspapers and celebrity magazine OK! Lloyd Embley also said Trinity Mirror was preparing to reveal an \u201cembarrassing\u201d gender pay gap with the enforced publication of official figures, because senior positions at the newspaper group are dominated by men. Embley said that the talks to buy Express Newspapers were taking longer than expected and would overshoot this year\u2019s target timeline. Previous talks to buy the newspapers failed two years ago. \u201cThe original aim was to try and have something done, if not completed, by the end of the year,\u201d said Embley in a staff Q&amp;A session. He added: \u201cWe are still hopeful and optimistic that it is still going in the right direction.\u201d Embley said that a takeover of the Express titles would generate significant cost savings, including the cutting of staff, but that if a deal did not go through Trinity Mirror would face even bigger cuts. Trinity Mirror, which also owns a large regional newspaper portfolio including the Manchester Evening News and Birmingham Post, employs more than 5,300 staff. About 2,200 of those are in editorial, with 700 of the editorial staff employed on the national titles and 1,500 on the regionals. \u201cIt will be impossible for me to stand here and say [the deal] won\u2019t mean job losses, there has to be,\u201d said Embley. However, he gave a strong indication that worse could be in store if the deal does not go ahead. \u201cWhat it will mean is we will be in a far more secure place once we have gone through putting ourselves together. This option is a considerably better option than the option [if there was no deal] we would have to look at if we didn\u2019t buy it.\u201d Embley pointed to Trinity Mirror\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d pension deficit, which stands at \u00a3406m, saying that with newspaper groups facing extremely tough advertising and sales conditions it needs the deal to fund increasing obligations that eat into profits. Staff also asked Embley how Trinity Mirror\u2019s gender pay gap was likely to compare with the BBC, which stands at about 9% difference between men and women, when it is publicly revealed. \u201cWorse,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is going to come out worse. Clearly it will be a bit embarrassing.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have far more very senior people who are almost exclusively men and that throws [the figures] a lot \u2013 they get paid more.\u201d Embley said that the embarrassing gender gap figures will force change at the publicly listed company. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t prompt some kind of change then there are going to be issues,\u201d he said. \u201cShareholders are going to be asking questions. The board are going to be asking questions because they will be in the firing line. We are the Mirror, we champion certain causes and things. Rightly so, if we can\u2019t get our own house in order then it doesn\u2019t look great, does it.\u201d In 2016, the UK gender pay gap was 9.4% for full-time workers, or 18.1% for all staff.",

    "webTitle": "As Norway sells out of oil, suddenly fossil fuels are starting to look risky", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite the rise of electric cars and stronger action on climate change, it\u2019s still too early to write the obituary of oil. That was the verdict last week of one of the world\u2019s leading energy experts, economist Dr Fatih Birol. The International Energy Agency, which he leads, is expecting growth in appetite for oil to slow over the next two decades, but doesn\u2019t see demand peaking this side of 2040 because the fuel will still be needed for trucks, ships, aviation and petrochemicals. As the energy watchdog drily notes, such a scenario would mean a disastrous failure to rein in the worst impacts of global warming. But there was a glimmer of hope last week from, ironically enough, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing countries. Unlike Britain, which squandered much of the wealth of its North Sea oil and gas boom, Norway has been sensible enough to squirrel away its hydrocarbon tax receipts \u2013 and now has a $1tn sovereign wealth fund to show for it. Now, the Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund, is proposing that it ditch the investments in the very industry the fund was built on. In a letter to Norway\u2019s finance ministry, Norges Bank wrote: \u201cWe conclude that the vulnerability of government wealth to a permanent drop in oil and gas prices will be reduced if the fund is not invested in oil and gas stocks, and advise removing these stocks from the fund\u2019s benchmark index.\u201d The recommendation rested \u201cexclusively on financial arguments\u201d, it added. Climate change and the environment did not even merit an aside \u2013 the advice is all about a fund manager maximising value for their client. Oil prices have yo-yoed from below $30 a barrel in January to more than $60 now due to output curbs by the world\u2019s biggest producers. But some experts think that in the medium term it will be lower than in recent decades \u2013 Shell\u2019s chief executive has warned of \u201clower forever\u201d rather than BP\u2019s \u201clower longer\u201d. Dieter Helm, an influential energy economist, believes oil prices will carry on falling forever. That\u2019s a risk that Norway\u2019s central bank does not want to take. The institution admits it may even be underestimating the risk from the fund\u2019s \u00a327.73bn oil and gas holdings, because oil firms\u2019 current low operating costs \u2013 a response to the 2014-16 price slump \u2013 may not last. \u201cThese [costs] may move differently to oil prices, which means that our analysis may underestimate the risk-mitigating effect of our recommendation on total oil risk in government wealth,\u201d the bank noted. It might be tempting to write off the significance of the move as parochial and relevant only to Norway, which is particularly exposed to oil price falls. Indeed, some observers have belittled the wider impact of its ditching its oil and gas stocks. \u201cNothing is imminent and even if the advice is fully implemented we believe this will have limited impact on the oil and gas producers, as the holdings of Norges Bank are relatively small and no doubt will be disposed of over an extended timeframe,\u201d said investment management firm Quilter Cheviot. They\u2019re right, to a degree. Norway\u2019s holdings of $5bn in Shell and $2bn in BP are not huge given the scale of those companies, and the share prices of both firms have recovered some of their falls since Norges Bank\u2019s proposal was published on Thursday. But that is to miss the big picture. A $1tn fund has just decided that oil and gas is a sector that\u2019s too risky to invest in. The decisions taken by Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund will have ripples, and major investment funds will take their cues from it. As activist group Share Action points out, institutional investors are already withdrawing capital from oil and gas firms whose business models look increasingly vulnerable. Norway\u2019s fund isn\u2019t the first to realise that, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. Airbus A380 is bold and beautiful, but is it too much of a behemoth? As auspicious places for Airbus to sell a few more of its A380 superjumbos go, this should have been a good one: on the home turf of its biggest buyer, which had signalled its intention to splash out. Instead, the Dubai airshow appears to have left more clouds over the European superjumbo after Emirates, the only airline to have consistently championed the A380, decided to spend $15bn on 40 Dreamliners from rival Boeing. An anticipated order for 30 Airbus planes apparently foundered on the failure to offer guarantees that they would still be in production in 10 or 15 years\u2019 time. Airbus chief executive Tom Enders has publicly professed faith in the future of the world\u2019s biggest jet aircraft, but neither its maker nor its main operator appears willing to bet the house on it. Airbus announced in 2015 that the A380\u2019s development costs had finally been recouped, but only eight of the $437m planes will now be built each year. Whether, or by how much, the discounted price airlines pay exceeds production costs is a secret known only to the manufacturer\u2019s accountants. Airbus\u2019s business hinges on far more than one model: in an order book that now surpasses a trillion dollars, the superjumbo plays an increasingly small part. The firm\u2019s profits took a knock this year, but its share price is rising, and plenty of airlines are convinced by its single-aisle A320neo. Indeed, the triumph of Dubai for Airbus was a single order for 430 of the short-haul planes, its biggest ever deal for departing sales supremo John Leahy. Yet even a record deal couldn\u2019t deflect questions over the missing superjumbo order. Only in the Gulf has this giant found the sustained financial backing and strategy to keep it flying, while other airlines have cut their cloth to suit different planes and routes. Emirates\u2019s equivocation will test Airbus executives\u2019 commitment. But it may have confirmed the demise of the A380: like all great dinosaurs, it\u2019s monumental and awe-inspiring, but maybe just too big for this world. Are wise men behind Greggs\u2019s sausage roll nativity? Plaudits to Greggs for generating a festive outrage last week that did not revolve around councils banning Christmas. The bakery chain made its pitch for the Daily Express front page by launching an advent calendar with a nativity scene where a sausage roll took the place of the infant Jesus. Cue an enormous social media backlash and the inevitable apology. But without wishing to spread Scrooge-like cynicism, Greggs\u2019 faux pas seems to have generated an awful lot of free publicity. Indeed, it is declining to pulp its calendar despite stating that it was \u201creally sorry to have caused any offence\u201d and \u201cthis was never our intention\u201d. Yes. And core sausage roll ingredients might fly. After this outrage, it is highly unlikely that the tills at one of Britain\u2019s most popular high street food chains will be having a bleak winterval. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Despite the rise of electric cars and stronger action on climate change, it\u2019s still too early to write the obituary of oil. That was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/us-net-oil-exporter-iea-international-energy-agency\">the verdict last week</a> of one of the world\u2019s leading energy experts, economist Dr Fatih Birol.</p> <p>The International Energy Agency, which he leads, is expecting growth in appetite for oil to slow over the next two decades, but doesn\u2019t see demand peaking this side of 2040 because the fuel will still be needed for trucks, ships, aviation and petrochemicals.</p> <p>As the energy watchdog drily notes, such a scenario would mean a disastrous failure to rein in the worst impacts of global warming.</p> <p>But there was a glimmer of hope last week from, ironically enough, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil-producing countries. Unlike Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/15/land-reforms-and-a-sovereign-fund-could-secure-uks-long-term-future\">which squandered much of the wealth of its North Sea oil and gas boom</a>, Norway has been sensible enough to squirrel away its hydrocarbon tax receipts \u2013 and now has a $1tn sovereign wealth fund to show for it.</p> <p>Now, the Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/oil-and-gas-shares-dip-as-norways-central-bank-advises-oslo-to-divest\">is proposing that it ditch the investments in the very industry the fund was built on</a>.</p> <p>In a letter to Norway\u2019s finance ministry, Norges Bank wrote: \u201cWe conclude that the vulnerability of government wealth to a permanent drop in oil and gas prices will be reduced if the fund is not invested in oil and gas stocks, and advise removing these stocks from the fund\u2019s benchmark index.\u201d</p> <p>The recommendation rested \u201cexclusively on financial arguments\u201d, it added. Climate change and the environment did not even merit an aside \u2013 the advice is all about a fund manager maximising value for their client.</p> <p>Oil prices have yo-yoed from below $30 a barrel in January to more than $60 now due to output curbs by the world\u2019s biggest producers.</p> <p>But some experts think that in the medium term it will be lower than in recent decades \u2013 Shell\u2019s chief executive has warned of \u201clower forever\u201d rather than BP\u2019s \u201clower longer\u201d. Dieter Helm, an influential energy economist, believes oil prices will carry on falling forever. That\u2019s a risk that Norway\u2019s central bank does not want to take.</p> <p>The institution admits it may even be underestimating the risk from the fund\u2019s \u00a327.73bn oil and gas holdings, because oil firms\u2019 current low operating costs \u2013 a response to the 2014-16 price slump \u2013 may not last.</p> <p>\u201cThese [costs] may move differently to oil prices, which means that our analysis may underestimate the risk-mitigating effect of our recommendation on total oil risk in government wealth,\u201d the bank noted.</p> <p>It might be tempting to write off the significance of the move as parochial and relevant only to Norway, which is particularly exposed to oil price falls.</p> <p>Indeed, some observers have belittled the wider impact of its ditching its oil and gas stocks. \u201cNothing is imminent and even if the advice is fully implemented we believe this will have limited impact on the oil and gas producers, as the holdings of Norges Bank are relatively small and no doubt will be disposed of over an extended timeframe,\u201d said investment management firm Quilter Cheviot.</p> <p>They\u2019re right, to a degree. Norway\u2019s holdings of $5bn in Shell and $2bn in BP are not huge given the scale of those companies, and the share prices of both firms have recovered some of their falls since Norges Bank\u2019s proposal was published on Thursday.</p> <p>But that is to miss the big picture. A $1tn fund has just decided that oil and gas is a sector that\u2019s too risky to invest in. The decisions taken by Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund will have ripples, and major investment funds will take their cues from it.</p> <p>As activist group Share Action points out, institutional investors are already withdrawing capital from oil and gas firms whose business models look increasingly vulnerable.

      "bodyText": "When 21-year-old Nathaniel Shaughnessy needed to find flexible paid work, he took a courier job with fast-food delivery firm Deliveroo, and for two years biked take-away meals from restaurants to customers. In February, the Deliveroo-branded food box that clipped to the back of his bike snapped off and he was given a second-hand backpack with a broken zip as a replacement. He was told that he would have to wait until September for a new one, but when the time came to collect it, he learned that the rules had changed and workers are expected to fund replacements themselves. Under the new policy recruits are expected to pay for everything at the outset. A backpack and insulating bag cost \u00a360. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s equipment breaks after six months they are expected to work the equivalent of the next 13 deliveries for nothing, just for the privilege of having the kit to do the job,\u201d says Shaughnessy. \u201cI can only imagine what this must be like for those for whom Deliveroo is their primary source of income.\u201d Shaughnessy\u2019s grievance echoes that of dozens of other riders who claim the company\u2019s practices deprive them of basic rights. Riders are classed as self-employed contractors who are not entitled to protections granted to employees and \u201cworkers\u201d \u2013 the latter being an employment classification that carries the right to the national minimum wage, union recognition and holiday pay. Last week, a tribunal ruled that Deliveroo riders in north London were not entitled to basic employment rights because they are not \u201cworkers\u201d. The case was brought in May by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to force the firm to accept the collective bargaining rights of its members. But in its ruling, the Central Arbitration Committee, which oversees collective bargaining law, concluded that Deliveroo couriers are self-employed because they have a right to ask a substitute to perform a job for them. By law, anyone with the right to do this is classed as self-employed, and self-employed workers aren\u2019t entitled to collective bargaining rights. Critics claim Deliveroo manipulated the system to duck its liabilities. It changed its contract to include this crucial \u201csubstitution clause\u201d just 11 days before the CAC hearing. The company says that it regularly updates its contracts \u201cto ensure that they reflect the reality of how riders work\u201d. But Annie Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day which launched the latest legal challenge, says: \u201cWe argue that the only reason they brought in the new contract was to defeat the union\u2019s case. The \u2018substitute rule\u2019 means that even if you don\u2019t want, or plan, to appoint anyone else to cover for you, the fact that the clause exists in a contract means you count as self-employed and lose basic rights. The law needs to change.\u201d The charges for essential kit were added to the contract at the same time. Again, Deliveroo insists this was to benefit its couriers who can now use non-branded items, allowing them to work for other companies between jobs. \u201cThey only buy what they need, so if they already have protective clothing, lights and helmet, they only have to buy the backpack and thermal bag,\u201d it says. The union has described the treatment, as evidenced by Shaughnessy, as callous and disrespectful. \u201cThey routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage their workforce,\u201d says Jim Benfield, a Deliveroo rider and secretary of the Courier and Logistics branch of the IWGB. Shaughnessy claims that riders are often unable to earn their dues because regular app outages prevent them from signing on for assigned shifts; the driver support team is frequently uncontactable; and payments are often miscalculated in Deliveroo\u2019s favour. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve worked four shifts in a week doing over 20 deliveries and received the pay equivalent for less than one shift,\u201d he says. Payments often have to be challenged after being miscalculated. The new requirement for workers to purchase mandatory equipment was the last straw for Shaughnessy who quit rather than fork out. Another policy change, introduced last month, means that riders on hourly rates can no longer work the same ongoing shift patterns to guarantee an income. Instead, they have to compete for available hours at the start of each week with those Deliveroo classes as \u201chigh performing\u201d and who have priority. Hours are also now capped at 55 a week. Deliveroo says the change is in response to rider feedback. \u201cIt provides greater certainty over earnings by accurately matching rider supply with customer demand,\u201d it says. \u201cRiders can book sessions in advance, cancel at any time or choose to turn up at the last minute.\u201d Riders, however, claim that the cap and the unpredictability has left them out of pocket. Sergio Ramos, a rider in London, reckons he has lost \u00a3125 a week. \u201cI used to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I\u2019m not allowed to block book more than 55.\u201d \u201cBlock bookings\u201d are those made on the day that available hours for the following week are released \u2013 and the cap only applies to them. Riders can top up more sessions after that, but there is no guarantee any will be left. Deliveroo drivers who work shifts are paid \u00a36 an hour (\u00a37 in London) plus \u00a31 a delivery. Those who prefer to work ad hoc earn \u00a33.75 per delivery rising to \u00a34.50 in rural areas. The minimum wage for over-25s is \u00a37.50, excluding expenses. \u201cOut of that money I have to pay for motorbike maintenance and equipment and \u00a31,300 a year for courier insurance,\u201d says Ramos, 40, who has four young children and reckons he\u2019s left with \u00a37.50 an hour before tax. \u201cLast year I broke my hip while on a delivery and was off work for eight weeks with no income.\u201d Annie Powell says that some of her clients earn \u201csubstantially\u201d less than the minimum wage. \u201cOne was more than \u00a3500 below the threshold for two months\u2019 work,\u201d she says. \u201cOur argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues.\u201d Deliveroo says that average hourly earnings work out at \u00a39.50 and that if the app, which details available jobs, stops working, riders on hourly pay are credited with the equivalent of 2.5 deliveries. It claims its workforce would be deprived of vital autonomy if it was given employment status as \u201c85% of riders say that flexibility is what they value most\u201d. It adds: \u201cThis enables them to work when and where they want, and for how long they want. We want employment law to be updated to allow us to offer riders benefits such as sick and injury pay, without limiting the flexibility they value.\u201d The need for new legislation is a \u201cfiction\u201d according to a parliamentary review, which concluded that profit \u2013 not flexibility \u2013 is the motive for using a self-employed workforce. The 21st-century phenomenon of the \u201cgig economy\u201d has, critics claim, undone a century of progress and reintroduced sweatshop conditions. The IWGB had hoped that a tribunal ruling forcing Deliveroo to recognise union membership, would haul it into the new millennium. Last week that hope proved a forlorn one. But experts reckon the CAC ruling should not affect the latest legal challenge for fair pay. They can take heart from Uber\u2019s recent defeat in a similar case brought by its drivers. FOR AND AGAINST SHORT-TERM WORK The so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d is a sector which relies on short-term contracts or freelancers. Instead of a regular salary, those who work in it get paid per job \u2013 or gig. Classed as independent contractors, they are not entitled to the national minimum wage or sickness, holiday or redundancy pay, and don\u2019t have guaranteed working hours. Supporters claim it allows people to choose their own working patterns, while businesses are spared statutory staff overheads. An estimated five million people work this way, and the Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts that in 2020-21 it will cost \u00a33.5bn in lost taxes. A government-sponsored review has recommended that firms with a \u201ccontrolling and supervisory\u201d relationship with workers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, should have to pay a full range of benefits, including national insurance contributions. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Again, Deliveroo insists this was to benefit its couriers who can now use non-branded items, allowing them to work for other companies between jobs. \u201cThey only buy what they need, so if they already have protective clothing, lights and helmet, they only have to buy the backpack and thermal bag,\u201d it says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage the workforce</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Benfield, Deliveroo rider</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The union has described the treatment, as evidenced by Shaughnessy, as callous and disrespectful. \u201cThey routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage their workforce,\u201d says Jim Benfield, a Deliveroo rider and secretary of the Courier and Logistics branch of the IWGB.</p> <p>Shaughnessy claims that riders are often unable to earn their dues because regular app outages prevent them from signing on for assigned shifts; the driver support team is frequently uncontactable; and payments are often miscalculated in Deliveroo\u2019s favour. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve worked four shifts in a week doing over 20 deliveries and received the pay equivalent for less than one shift,\u201d he says. Payments often have to be challenged after being miscalculated.</p> <p>The new requirement for workers to purchase mandatory equipment was the last straw for Shaughnessy who quit rather than fork out.</p> <p>Another policy change, introduced last month, means that riders on hourly rates can no longer work the same ongoing shift patterns to guarantee an income. Instead, they have to compete for available hours at the start of each week with those Deliveroo classes as \u201chigh performing\u201d and who have priority. Hours are also now capped at 55 a week. Deliveroo says the change is in response to rider feedback. \u201cIt provides greater certainty over earnings by accurately matching rider supply with customer demand,\u201d it says. \u201cRiders can book sessions in advance, cancel at any time or choose to turn up at the last minute.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/deliveroo-couriers-minimum-wage-holiday-pay\">Deliveroo wins right not to give riders minimum wage or holiday pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Riders, however, claim that the cap and the unpredictability has left them out of pocket. Sergio Ramos, a rider in London, reckons he has lost \u00a3125 a week. \u201cI used to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I\u2019m not allowed to block book more than 55.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlock bookings\u201d are those made on the day that available hours for the following week are released \u2013 and the cap only applies to them. Riders can top up more sessions after that, but there is no guarantee any will be left.</p> <p>Deliveroo drivers who work shifts are paid \u00a36 an hour (\u00a37 in London) plus \u00a31 a delivery. Those who prefer to work ad hoc earn \u00a33.75 per delivery rising to \u00a34.50 in rural areas. The minimum wage for over-25s is \u00a37.50, excluding expenses.</p> <p>\u201cOut of that money I have to pay for motorbike maintenance and equipment and \u00a31,300 a year for courier insurance,\u201d says Ramos, 40, who has four young children and reckons he\u2019s left with \u00a37.50 an hour before tax. \u201cLast year I broke my hip while on a delivery and was off work for eight weeks with no income.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Powell says that some of her clients earn \u201csubstantially\u201d less than the minimum wage. \u201cOne was more than \u00a3500 below the threshold for two months\u2019 work,\u201d she says. \u201cOur argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues.\u201d</p> <p>Deliveroo says that average hourly earnings work out at \u00a39.50 and that if the app, which details available jobs, stops working, riders on hourly pay are credited with the equivalent of 2.5 deliveries. It claims its workforce would be deprived of vital autonomy if it was given employment status as \u201c85% of riders say that flexibility is what they value most\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThis enables them to work when and where they want, and for how long they want. We want employment law to be updated to allow us to offer riders benefits such as sick and injury pay, without limiting the flexibility they value.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/21/deliveroo-boss-gives-himself-225-rise-amid-battle-over-riders-pay\">Deliveroo boss Will Shu gives himself 22.5% rise amid battle over riders' pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The need for new legislation is a \u201cfiction\u201d according to a parliamentary review, which concluded that profit \u2013 not flexibility \u2013 is the motive for using a self-employed workforce.</p> <p>The 21st-century phenomenon of the \u201cgig economy\u201d has, critics claim, undone a century of progress and reintroduced sweatshop conditions.

An estimated five million people work this way, and the Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts that in 2020-21 it will cost \u00a33.5bn in lost taxes.</p> <p>A government-sponsored review has recommended that firms with a \u201ccontrolling and supervisory\u201d relationship with workers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, should have to pay a full range of benefits, including national insurance contributions.</p> <p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

But the uncomfortable truth is that a bunch of ideological Brexit clowns have perpetrated a coup on the British government and the majority of the British people. Seldom \u2013 or, to be more precise, never \u2013 in half a century of covering British economics have I encountered such a failure of leadership at a time of crisis. We came close to the abyss in 1976 but were saved by Jim Callaghan, the prime minister, and Denis Healey, the chancellor. On that occasion, after fraught talks, the two held the cabinet together and negotiated a loan from the International Monetary Fund which restored our credibility in the markets. Callaghan and Healey were political giants. So were the dissidents such as Tony Crosland, Michael Foot and Tony Benn, whom they managed to win round. And their civil servants respected what their political masters were trying to do. No such respect now, and not surprisingly. It is increasingly obvious that, in Brexit, the British public has been sold a pup. The negotiations with our EU counterparts and the debate in Westminster have reached satirical proportions for one simple reason: the government has embarked on Mission Impossible. This, I think, is the principal explanation for the deepening nastiness in tone of the more vociferous Brexiters. It started with the execrable attack by the Daily Mail on the supreme court for concluding that parliament, not the executive, should have the ultimate say. The irony that the Mail and their Brexit friends were campaigning for bringing back ultimate authority from European law to British lawyers whose judgment they objected to seems to have escaped them. Then they moved on to attack those of us who wish to call a halt to this Gadarene rush to the Brexit cliff as \u201csaboteurs\u201d or \u201ctraitors\u201d. What a wonderful distortion of language it is to describe patriots as traitors! Then, last week, we had the Daily Telegraph, in former days renowned for the fairness of its news coverage, making the main news on its front page photographs of 15 Conservative MPs presented as a kind of rogues\u2019 gallery, with the banner headline \u201cThe Brexit Mutineers\u201d. All this smacks of panic in the ranks of the Brexiters. And yet, if there is not exactly panic in the ranks of the Remain camp, the complaint I continually hear is that it still lacks a strong leader. Why, even George Osborne\u2019s biographer, Janan Ganesh, was hinting in the Financial Times last week that it needs someone with the determination of Gordon Brown. The recent publication of Brown\u2019s fascinating memoirs reminds one, too, of his heroic exercise of leadership in 2008-09, in rescuing the world economy from the financial crisis. His memoirs contain a strong defence of the Keynesian measures he took and preached to others \u2013 an example of leadership that won the approbation of Presidents Obama and Sarkozy. Unfortunately, the stimulus in this country was withdrawn prematurely by the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition, whose policies of austerity from 2010 onwards damaged not only the social fabric but also investment and the productivity on which it depends. Indeed, as Remainer Philip Hammond has been drawing up the budget \u2013 due on Wednesday \u2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the economy\u2019s enfeebled productivity places a manifest constraint on his room for manoeuvre, as does the prospect of Brexit. This does not, of course, deter the Brexiters: not at all. Both the ubiquitous Jacob Rees-Mogg and that long-time Eurosceptic John Redwood \u2013 one of John Major\u2019s \u201cbastards\u201d \u2013 have told the Treasury to make its forecasts more optimistic, so that a cushion can be provided for the damage that will almost certainly occur if Brexit is not stopped. Redwood knows the score: in his capacity as an investment adviser he has been downplaying the prospects for Britain and advising clients to invest in, er, mainland Europe. Redwood and Rees-Mogg seem blissfully unaware that, first, the Treasury no longer makes pre-budget forecasts, and, second, that it was precisely to discontinue the ancient practice of chancellors trying to fiddle the forecast that responsibility for it was put in the hands of the OBR. Incidentally, I do not blame non-experts for being misled by Brexiters\u2019 false claims in the referendum. The Cameron government should have explained how the whole of the UK benefits from the EU. We are essentially a region of Europe, and take for granted a daily supply system of goods, services and \u2013 especially \u2013 food that would be severely disrupted by \u201cno deal\u201d and the consequent huge bureaucratic problems at the ports. Only last week the benefits of being part of a strong trading bloc were demonstrated when the European commission made it clear that it would be acting for the UK in the dispute between Boeing and Bombardier. Brussels has clout in trade disputes; on its own the UK would be crushed in negotiation by powerful US lobbies. When we applied to join the EEC in the early 1970s, the negotiations were founded on common objectives: both sides wanted UK entry. On Brexit there are no common objectives; hence the shambles. All this stuff about \u201cnegotiating\u201d a \u00a320bn divorce settlement is so much hogwash. We are legally bound to pay some \u00a360bn in the course of the rest of the decade anyway. That is, whether or not we go ahead on this disastrous course. My impression is that people are gradually hearing the opposite message, not least the young. If the polls move markedly in favour of Remain, then whoever is prime minister should broadcast to the nation that it is time to think again.",

    "webTitle": "As Amazon opens a guerrilla store, has the internet beaten the high street?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On London\u2019s Oxford Street a row of glittering snowflakes guides shoppers along the golden mile of fashion and department stores. The 750,000 lights floating above Selfridges, John Lewis and Debenhams are a decades-old tradition but events like Black Friday have changed Christmas shopping for ever. The UK high street has just experienced something of a watershed, what some have called its \u201cTesla moment\u201d. Online fashion website Asos overtook Marks &amp; Spencer in market value terms for the first time despite not having a single store to its name. The comparison with the automotive industry comes because electric carmaker Tesla moved ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company in market value earlier this year. The growing might of the internet will be writ large when the \u00a310bn battle for sales in Black Friday week is tapped out on websites rather than from bargain hunting in stores. \u201cOnline has been a catalyst that has reinforced the fact that we have too many shops in the UK,\u201d says Matthew Hopkinson, director at retail consultancy Local Data Company. \u201cAround 10% of the UK retail stock is surplus to requirements, which equates to about 50,000 stores.\u201d It\u2019s a frightening statistic for an industry where jobs are already disappearing at an alarming rate. The retail workforce has shrunk from 3.2 million in 2008 to around 3 million today with the British Retail Consortium predicting another 900,000 jobs will disappear by 2025 as companies end their leases on unprofitable stores. That pace of job reduction has accelerated this year, with the BRC\u2019s most recent figures showing the biggest drop in hours worked and employment since it started keeping records in 2008, as the technological revolution in retail reduces demand for labour. \u201cThe internet is the most powerful marketing channel we have ever seen,\u201d says Hopkinson. \u201cIt brings with it a massive amount of convenience so you only have to go shopping for the things that you actually want to. You no longer have to do mundane shopping.\u201d Recent industry data shows retailers fighting a losing battle to lure customers into their stores with shopper numbers down more than 9% in October, according to the most recent figures from Ipsos Retail Performance\u2019s shopper tracker. One retail analyst likens the diverging fortunes of the physical and digital high street to Netflix sci-fi show Stranger Things where a malevolent alternative dimension, the \u201cupside down\u201d, is encroaching on everyday life. \u201cRetail seems trapped, with a real world showing online sales booming and an upside down world showing increasingly scary results for high street stores,\u201d says David Jinks, of ParcelCompare. In a further inversion of the norm, some internet-only stores are selling their wares via seasonal pop-up shops. Amazon will open a guerrilla store in central London that will last as long as one of its Black Friday deals. The pop-up shop will showcase bestsellers in mock room sets as well as offer shoppers tutorials from \u201csocial media influencers\u201d Lottie Tomlinson and Gizzi Erskine. By the end of the year Britons will have spent nearly \u00a360bn via their phones and tablets \u2013 a figure that equates to more than \u00a31 in every \u00a36 spent on the high street. The trend is expected to continue, with online sales predicted to hit almost \u00a3100bn by 2021, according to consultants at Retail Economics. With the retail market barely growing, the web is sucking sales out of high street stores, making life more difficult for traditional stores such as M&amp;S, Next and Debenhams, which have long dominated the high street. It also comes at a time when Britons are carefully monitoring their budgets because inflation is eroding their spending power. Some chains have begun to take tough decisions about the future of their stores. M&amp;S has said it will close 30 stores, while a further 45 are being downsized or converted into food-only outlets. But many analysts think retailers will have to go further given the pace of high street change. Mothercare, for example, plans to halve the size of its 150-store UK chain after more than 40% of its sales shifted online. Retailers are following the consumers\u2019 lead after watching online retail sales double over a five-year period. The growth in online spending also holds a mirror up to how we spend our free time. In 2010, 60% of adults went online every day. That figure is now 84%, according to the Office for National Statistics. \u201cIt is the structural change in the way people interact with digital technology that is altering the retail industry,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, who also points to a shift in spending to the so-called \u201cexperience economy\u201d as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment. Steve Howard, Ikea\u2019s head of sustainability, caused ripples last year when he suggested households had reached saturation point. \u201cIf we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff,\u201d he told a conference. \u201cWe talk about peak oil. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff \u2026 peak home furnishings.\u201d Until the Brexit blow to sterling, Britons had benefited from 20 years of falling prices as canny retailers imported vast quantities of goods produced cheaply in Asia. There is now an abundance of material possessions,\u201d says Lim. \u201cFor the past two decades British shoppers have enjoyed persistent deflation so the economic value they attach to purchases is diminishing.\u201d He gives the example of people buying their first iPad, which was a much bigger deal than when they upgraded to their fourth or fifth model. This purchase fatigue is changing what we spend our money on as we relish holidays or treat ourselves to days out. In the early 1960s retail accounted for close to a third of Britons\u2019 spending, but that figure is 24% today and is expected to fall further still. Shifting priorities have seen retailers invest heavily in creating more dynamic store experiences to pull shoppers away from their screens. A recent example of the trend is John Lewis\u2019s new Oxford store where more than a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft of selling space is devoted to 21 \u201cservices and experiences\u201d, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles. Some analysts argue the internet should no longer be seen as the enemy of the store. Amazon put a cat among the pigeons earlier this year when it swooped on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. The move showed that even the biggest of the online giants saw value in a physical store network. Closer to home, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s swallowed Argos last year for \u00a31.4bn as it looked to borrow the catalogue chain\u2019s successful model, which marries stores, the web and super-fast delivery. Argos chief executive John Rogers explains a new topsy-turvy retail landscape where 60% of orders originate online but two-thirds of those shoppers turn up in store to collect their toys, kettles and toasters. Despite a plethora of delivery options, 80% of its orders end up being fulfilled the old-fashioned way through the now combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos store network. Rogers says that it is no longer possible to \u201cdelineate\u201d between online and physical sales as customers move seamlessly between the two worlds. \u201cThe majority of orders start online but are fulfilled in our stores,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t overestimate the importance of that flexibility. I\u2019m a big believer in stores but there is no question that online will continue to grow.\u201d In the coming days retailers will wage a fierce battle for Black Friday sales, an event that will be a litmus test for the key Christmas period, when many bank the lion\u2019s share of their annual profits. Rogers is determined that Argos will be one of the winners from these first skirmishes, insisting that if you have the right products at the right prices, the demand is there. \u201cI think Christmas will be big this year, but it will come later,\u201d he predicts of the nail-biting trading days ahead. \u201cI would not write off stores.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>On London\u2019s Oxford Street a row of glittering snowflakes guides shoppers along the golden mile of fashion and department stores. The 750,000 lights floating above Selfridges, John Lewis and Debenhams are a decades-old tradition but events like Black Friday have changed Christmas shopping for ever.</p> <p>The UK high street has just experienced something of a watershed, what some have called its \u201cTesla moment\u201d. Online fashion website Asos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/18/asos-overtakes-m-and-s-marks-spencer-uk-high-street-tesla-moment\">overtook Marks &amp; Spencer</a> in market value terms for the first time despite not having a single store to its name. The comparison with the automotive industry comes because electric carmaker Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\">moved ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company</a> in market value earlier this year.</p> <p>The growing might of the internet will be writ large when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/17/uk-shoppers-forecast-to-spend-10bn-in-black-friday-sales\">\u00a310bn battle for sales</a> in Black Friday week is tapped out on websites rather than from bargain hunting in stores.</p> <p>\u201cOnline has been a catalyst that has reinforced the fact that we have too many shops in the UK,\u201d says Matthew Hopkinson, director at retail consultancy Local Data Company. \u201cAround 10% of the UK retail stock is surplus to requirements, which equates to about 50,000 stores.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a frightening statistic for an industry where jobs are already disappearing at an alarming rate. The retail workforce has shrunk from 3.2 million in 2008 to around 3 million today with the British Retail Consortium predicting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/uk-retail-sector-predicted-to-cut-900000-jobs\">another 900,000 jobs will disappear by 2025</a> as companies end their leases on unprofitable stores.</p> <p>That pace of job reduction has accelerated this year, with the BRC\u2019s most recent figures showing the biggest drop in hours worked and employment since it started keeping records in 2008, as the technological revolution in retail reduces demand for labour.</p> <p>\u201cThe internet is the most powerful marketing channel we have ever seen,\u201d says Hopkinson. \u201cIt brings with it a massive amount of convenience so you only have to go shopping for the things that you actually want to. You no longer have to do mundane shopping.\u201d</p> <p>Recent industry data shows retailers fighting a losing battle to lure customers into their stores with shopper numbers down more than 9% in October, according to the most recent figures from Ipsos Retail Performance\u2019s shopper tracker.</p> <p>One retail analyst likens the diverging fortunes of the physical and digital high street to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/16/haute-hawkins-how-stranger-things-won-fashion\">Netflix sci-fi show</a> <em>Stranger Things</em> where a malevolent alternative dimension, the \u201cupside down\u201d, is encroaching on everyday life. \u201cRetail seems trapped, with a real world showing online sales booming and an upside down world showing increasingly scary results for high street stores,\u201d says David Jinks, of ParcelCompare.</p> <p>In a further inversion of the norm, some internet-only stores are selling their wares via seasonal pop-up shops. Amazon will open a guerrilla store in central London that will last as long as one of its Black Friday deals. The pop-up shop will showcase bestsellers in mock room sets as well as offer shoppers tutorials from \u201csocial media influencers\u201d Lottie Tomlinson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/03/gizzi-erskine-how-i-get-ready\">Gizzi Erskine</a>.</p> <p>By the end of the year Britons will have spent nearly \u00a360bn via their phones and tablets \u2013 a figure that equates to more than \u00a31 in every \u00a36 spent on the high street. The trend is expected to continue, with online sales predicted to hit almost \u00a3100bn by 2021, according to consultants at Retail Economics.</p> <p>With the retail market barely growing, the web is sucking sales out of high street stores, making life more difficult for traditional stores such as M&amp;S, Next and Debenhams, which have long dominated the high street. It also comes at a time when Britons are carefully monitoring their budgets because inflation is eroding their spending power.</p> <p>Some chains have begun to take tough decisions about the future of their stores. M&amp;S has said it will close 30 stores, while a further 45 are being downsized or converted into food-only outlets. But many analysts think retailers will have to go further given the pace of high street change. Mothercare, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/mothercare-looking-to-close-up-to-70-uk-stores\">plans to halve the size of its 150-store UK chain</a> after more than 40% of its sales shifted online.</p> <p>Retailers are following the consumers\u2019 lead after watching online retail sales double over a five-year period. The growth in online spending also holds a mirror up to how we spend our free time. In 2010, 60% of adults went online every day. That figure is now 84%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the structural change in the way people interact with digital technology that is altering the retail industry,\u201d says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, who also points to a shift in spending to the so-called \u201cexperience economy\u201d as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e9694ba56cb792cdef280cf7de678495f142f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e9694ba56cb792cdef280cf7de678495f142f8/0_356_4750_2850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peak home furnishings?

      "bodyText": "Strike action at McDonald\u2019s is to spread to outlets across the country in the coming months, following the lead of workers at two restaurants in the south of England. Dossiers on claims made by staff, ranging from the company\u2019s alleged failure to provide protective equipment for workers using grills to allegations about management mishandling sexual assault claims, are being compiled by trade unionists. The September strikes were the first at McDonald\u2019s since it opened in the UK in the 1970s. Branches in the north-east and north-west of England, Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales are expected to be involved in the next stage of attempts to build up a union structure at the company. About 40 staff went on strike in September at two restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, south-east London, after a ballot in favour of industrial action amid concerns over low wages and the use of zero-hours contracts. The fast-food chain has been one of the biggest users of zero-hours contracts in Britain, although it has this year started offering workers the option of moving to fixed hours. \u201cWe are looking at moving [the strikes] right across the country so we are planning very carefully how that will be done and how workers can take part,\u201d said Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers, Food &amp; Allied Workers Union, one of Britain\u2019s oldest trade unions. Workers in managerial positions are also among those who have come forward to voice concerns confidentially about issues including burns sustained from grease popping from grills. At least one McDonald\u2019s worker in the UK has also alleged that the company did not respond adequately to claims that she was sexually assaulted by a more senior member of staff. Tom Holliday, a 25-year old a shop steward at a branch in Cambridge told the Observer that awareness of the union had increased both among colleagues and customers since the strike. \u201cThings have settled down now and we have moved into having regular meetings to talk about issues in the work place and how we can win small changes,\u201d he said \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the correct protective equipment and the company has now acted on that and given us the correct equipment. We needed visors and aprons in order to clean out filters. Since the strike we put in a complaint and it was immediately brought in.\u201d He added that action had also been taken in relation to customers who had been rude and aggressive towards staff. \u201cIn the past rude customers were completely ignored. The reaction would be to give them free food to get them to go away. One particular customer would threaten people and we had consistently made the point that this person should be banned. As a result action has been taken.\u201d Holliday, a father with a young son, believed that the expansion of efforts to build a union presence would help moves for pay claims. \u201cOn a personal level it has been empowering to take the action and the support has been much greater than we expected. We still get people coming through in the drive throughasking how it is going and what is going to happen in the future.\u201d A spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cHealth and safety is of paramount importance to us and we place great emphasis on our employees\u2019 safety. We have robust training and processes in place for our staff and our restaurants are regularly inspected by environmental health officers to ensure our high standards are upheld.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re unable to comment on individual HR cases, but would, of course, take any accusation of sexual harassment extremely seriously.\u201d",
