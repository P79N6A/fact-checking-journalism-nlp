    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Royal Mail workers win pay increase of 9% over three years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail staff will get a pay increase of more than 9% over three years after the company and its union announced what they said was a groundbreaking legal agreement on industrial relations at the newly privatised company. The deal was announced as the government's fiscal watchdog indicated most workers would have to wait another two years before wage rises returned to \"normal\" levels of 2% a year. The 9.06% increase in basic pay at Royal Mail is more than the 8.6% the Communication Workers Union rejected in July. The company's 139,000 workers will also get a one-off \u00a3200 payment this month, down from \u00a3300 the company offered before. Royal Mail also agreed to a string of union demands on job security, pensions and other conditions which will apply for five years, at the same time as increasing union involvement in the running of the business in a move towards \"German-style\" industrial relations. The five year deal includes: \u2022 No franchising or outsourcing of businesses. \u2022 A ban on zero-hours contracts for Royal Mail employees. \u2022 A full-time workforce with the aim of no compulsory redundancies. \u2022 No downgrades to employees' agreed working conditions. \u2022 Extra payments by Royal Mail into employees' pension scheme. Royal Mail said that in return the union had signed up to measures designed to prevent local strikes and remove the threat of national action by the CWU. The main provisions were an undertaking to bring in national union and company officers immediately to resolve local disputes and moving to independent mediation within a week, as well as using more independent mediation such as Acas at national level. The union will also take part in a monthly \"growth forum\" with company top brass and make presentations to Royal Mail's full board. The deal stops short of a no-strike agreement but Royal Mail can withdraw from the employee protection agreement if the CWU holds national industrial action. Royal Mail said this gave the CWU a big incentive to reach agreement instead of threatening a strike. Nick Bacon, professor of human resource management at Cass Business School, said: \"This looks like a very brave and innovative agreement. Its long-term focus starts to look more like a US mutual gains agreement or a German industry-wide agreement. \"There will be hiccups along the way and tensions \u2013 it's not easy to adopt a more co-operative approach when you are used to industrial relations being based more on conflict. I would imagine that many trade unions would bite employers' hands off for this kind of arrangement in the current climate.\" It came as the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, Robert Chote, told MPs that falling real-terms wages, coupled with increasing house prices, were holding down living standards. Giving evidence to the House of Commons Treasury committee, Chote said: \"We are still waiting for productivity growth to pick up. The expectation would be that that would lead to earnings growth. In terms of real earnings, we don't get the sort of 2%-a-year real growth in wages and salaries that people would have been used to on past historical experience for a couple of years still.\" As well as facing the threat of national industrial action, Royal Mail has suffered multiple local disputes that have disrupted services. In 2007 and 2009, two-thirds of all strike days in the UK were at Royal Mail. The company and the union said the agreement would underpin a big expansion of parcel capacity as it battles for business with competitors. The company sees growth of parcels, fuelled by increasing use of the internet by consumers, as the key to its prospects as letters become less popular. The CWU's deputy general secretary, Dave Ward, said: \"The agreement breaks new ground in the UK by incorporating extensive, legally binding protections for employees alongside a commitment to improve industrial stability. The legal protections for Royal Mail employees come hard on the heels of the privatisation of the company and are unprecedented in delivering the strongest protections for employees.\" The CWU has fought a long battle to preserve its members' terms and conditions under Royal Mail's new ownership by City investors. The risk of a national strike was cited as one factor in the 330p valuation of Royal Mail shares in the company's flotation in October. The shares have since gained 80%, closing on Monday up 0.4% at 597p \u2013 just short of the company's record 599p closing price since the float. Royal Mail said the pay and pensions agreements did not change its financial outlook or its business plan. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: \"This will provide long-term stability and certainty for Royal Mail, our employees and our customers at this pivotal time. Working together we can create a strong foundation for the continued success of our business.\" Under the pay deal, Royal Mail workers will get a 3% pay rise this financial year, backdated to April, another 3% rise next year and 2.8% in 2014-2015. Gert Zonneveld, an industry analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: \"For investors it depends on how aggressive you are as an investor. If you were hoping the company would really aggressively negotiate with the union you will be slightly disappointed. But most investors realise that to achieve change you need the cooperation of your union. \"Nobody has a crystal ball so you can't always commit yourself but they have agreed to certain things and to having a clear and open dialogue. There are no bad surprises and most investors will be pleased there's an agreement.\"",

Presenting Halifax \u2013 which is owned by the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 as the \"challenger\" bank in Scotland, David Nicholson claimed it was \"the most switched-to banking brand\". Halifax is attracting current account customers at a rate that would bring in 300,000 in a year, with 200,000 of those switching from other current account providers, Nicholson said. The pace of new account openings has slowed since May, when the bank thought it could be on track for 400,000 new current accounts this year. It has been vying with the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander and the Nationwide Building Society to win new current account business since the introduction in September of the seven day switching service for current accounts, in which banks and building societies pledge to shift accounts quickly.

Nicholson was speaking as a new branch opened in Aberdeen \u2013 others will follow in Edinburgh and Glasgow \u2013 which is one of a new style of branch aimed at keeping pace with technological changes. \"We are now reintroducing Halifax as a stand-alone brand so we can really be a challenger on the high street in Scotland,\" he said. More customers are now using digital banking and mobile phone banking than branches and cash machines, Nicholson said, so more space in the branch is given over for individuals to use their tablets. Last month, Barclays said it would axe 1,700 roles as it rolled out new technology.

So much was obvious from his speech in Manhattan on Monday night, where he pushed back against the idea that the developed world was gripped by what the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers calls secular stagnation. We have been here before, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Malthus was wrong when he predicted that any gains from technological progress would be swamped by the effects of population growth. Alvin Hansen \u2013 the godfather of secular stagnation theory \u2013 did not foresee amid the gloom of the 1930s that the global economy was poised on the brink of three decades of expansion. It may be that modern-day economists such as Robert Gordon \u2013 who argues that the current wave of innovations have less growth potential than those at the end of the 19th century \u2013 are also being too gloomy. Carney certainly thinks so. \"Such worries have proven misplaced in the past and scepticism is warranted now\", he said, adding that the US economy is now 13 times bigger than it was when Hansen first came up with his ideas. There are three reasons why the governor deserves the benefit of the doubt. Firstly, forecasts of the future tend to be affected by events in the recent past. When economies are booming, the expectation is that the good times will never end. When times are dark, it is impossible to imagine that the dawn will ever break again. Secondly, it is a bit early to assess what the technological advances of the past couple of decades will mean for growth. There were cars in the US by the end of the 19th century but it was not until after the second world war \u2013 with the building of the interstates, the development of the suburbs and the advent of mass consumer prosperity \u2013 that the full potential was realised. It could easily be a similar story for the digital revolution, nanotechnology, robotics and biotechnology. Finally, macroeconomic policy makes a difference. The job of central banks and finance ministries when economies have suffered profound shocks is to nurse them back to health. In the current circumstances that means keeping the level of demand high enough to avoid deflation and reforming the financial system to avoid a repeat of the excesses that led to the crash of 2007. Why is deflation less of a threat in the US than in the euro area? Because interest rates were slashed, quantitative easing embraced with gusto, and austerity delayed until recovery was under way. In the US, the economy is now strong enough for the Federal Reserve to consider paring back the stimulus from quantitative easing. There is no immediate sign of the Bank of England doing likewise in the UK, and Carney's message was that supply side changes will happen more quickly if borrowing costs remain low for a good while yet.

      "bodyText": "Time for a closing summary: Mark Carney has said rising house prices require \"vigilance not panic\". Interest rates will not rise for the near future and he ruled out changes to his forward guidance policy. Household incomes will not return to to 2008 levels until 2016, according to the OBR. Aerospace giant EADS cuts more than 5000 jobs The European Central Bank's Yves Mersch says QE stimulus would be difficult. Greek deflation hit a record in November Thank you for following, and for all the comments. See you tomorrow. And here is some of the Twitter chatter on the Carney speech. The bods at the Office for Budget Responsibility are not the only ones thinking about the puzzle of low UK productivity. In a speech in New York, the governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has said productivity is likely to improve. Here are some of the top lines: The economic news from the UK is positive with 60,000 jobs being created a month. Rising house prices require \"vigilance but not panic\". But this does not mean that warnings are without merit or that interest rates will return to normal anytime soon. As part-time workers shift into full-time work, productivity should pick up. But wage growth won't happen soon: skills have declined and companies have missed out on productivity advances. The Bank is aware of the problem of extended financial stimulus and will act in a timely way. You can read the full speech here - skip to page 8 for Carney's take on Dickens' Christmas Carol - the Ghost of Christmas Past is high leverage and weak demand for advanced economies's exports apparently... Question of the day from committee chair Andrew Tyrie \"The trouble with forecasts from government bodies is that people exaggerate their importance,\" he begins People treat your forecasts as they did government forecasts. You might expect Chote to disagree and he does: I think we are in a position to be more candid and transparent about why our forecasts have changed... we are under much less pressure to do conviction forecasting. Tyrie asks whether the OBR has come under pressure from the Treasury and other government bodies to change its forecasts. Chote says no. And on that note, it is thanks all round, and the session is over. John Thurso of the Liberal Democrats wants to return to the \"productivity puzzle\". It seems to him Chote is saying productivity has been impaired and will not come back, while the Bank of England is more optimistic it will come back. Chote's answer: Almost everyone is assuming that some part of the weakness in productivity is likely lost for good and the path for potential productivity growth is lower than it was. The uncertainty is about the extent of that loss and I think would find a range of views on that on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. Chote is asked about the economist's favourite tool: statistics. He says that economic debate can carry on for a long time : \"the 1990s recession is still being re-written significantly 20 years after the event.\" Asked whether the Office for National Statistics could do with more funding, he says: \"more money well spent would doubtless produce better, more reliable statistics and we would happily consume them.\" Since the crisis - living standards - using whichever definition - have fallen each year. Do you agree, asks Love. Nickell replies: \"I don't know about every year, but we are certainly lower now than we were then.\" When will they be back up to pre-recession levels? The short answer - \"2016.\" Back in the committee room we are on to living standards. Andrew Love, a Labour MP, says household disposable income is a problematic way to measure living standards. He suggests average real household income would be a more appropriate way to measure living standards and asks what the OBR thinks. Steve Nickell agrees there are issues with using household disposable income to measure living standards, e.g. pension contributions are counted as disposable income, although this is not part of what the average person would think of as disposable income. Bit of quibbling and clarification over definitions and mean/median now. Love asks \"a simpler question\" - do you disagree living standards declined? All the data tells us that real household incomes have been falling, says Nickell. Asked whether it would take several years before household spending refers to pre-recession levels - the OBR people all say yes. A quick diversion to the markets: the FTSE100 has recovered its earlier losses, ending the day (slightly) up. FTSE100 closes at 6,559 points, up 0.11% Andrea Ledsom, Conservative eurosceptic MP, is asking about instability in the eurozone and whether the OBR has looked at the consequences of the French economy going into deep recession, or Germany booming while the Italian economy doesn't. Chote refers to the other forecasters who survey the eurozone more regularly: the IMF etc. There hasn't been recently [eurozone crisis] but this has bitten us in the past. Ledsom turns to the work the OBR is doing on shocks to emerging markets. Chote talks about how changes in the U.S Federal Reserve's monetary policy can have broader spillover effects, but again, says that others are doing more work on this. Asked about export-led growth, he also says trade will not make a significant contribution to GDP: We have very little to GDP growth from net trade over the course of the 5 years of the recovery. Ledsom ends her round of questions: Depressing Chote is now defending the OBR's forecasts on business investment, saying it is a volatile series and always heavily revised. A medium-term view can be a more sensible path than looking at the quarter-on-quarter changes. Forecast for the next five years: a pick up in business investment and a rise to levels that don't look out of line with previous recessions. There are good reasons to believe that at some point business investment is going to pick up, Chote says but you would be foolish to rely on the quarterly forecasts. Chote is being asked about the fall in business investment growth between 2010 and 2012 He names three reasons: uncertainty about consumer demand, lack of internal finance and weak productivity Since the 2012 budget, the ONS has changed its methodology and now there is quite a different picture. Brooks Newmark, a Conservative MP, is asking about the disparity in house prices across the regions. Chote says they don't do regional house price forecasts. Graham Parker of the OBR says they are not expecting London prices to go down. How important are house prices to the recovery, Newmark wants to know. Chote says that consumer spending has been one surprise in the GDP figures, housing investment has been the other - and this is not just building houses, but the transfer of houses. Robert Chote is also being asked about house prices. He says prices are already 3.6% higher than the OBR anticipated they would be in March. You would need to have a very big increase in housebuilding stock to have an influence on prices. Now up is Steve Nickell of the OBR on the housing market. He says that UK mortgage borrowers and lenders have been cautious - \" which may surprise people but is nevertheless true\". Repossessions have been low compared to the 90s and mortgage lenders' losses have been absolutely tiny, he said. You could say this is because of more forbearance from lenders and low interest rates. He says: I think it is perfectly true to say there will be some households who will be stretched when interest rates rise... [but] what really gets households intro trouble is a change in the financial circumstances of the household, either because of unemployment or sickness, not because of changes in interest rates. If we sustain levels of owner occupation we have had over last 10 years, debt levels will go up. Can house prices be sustained? Nickell says that going back to normal - in a world where real incomes are rising and household numbers are rising - \"a fundamental flaw\" in the housing market is that not enough houses are being built. The most interesting part I lost with the feed delay: Andrew Tyrie, committee chair, is asking whether savings ratio is compatible with long-run growth. Chote says he doesn't see why it shouldn't be incompatible. Chote says the OBR is still waiting for productivity growth to pick up - without this there won't be real growth in earnings and salary. Consumption is rising faster, leading to a fall in the savings ratio. But the OBR doesn't have a view on an optimal savings ratio. \"There is a tendency to view it as an index of moral fibre but I wouldn't go as far as that. The feed has gone live and we are are pitched in halfway through a statement. Chote is saying that the increase in household debt need not be a problem. He moved on to talk about why \"the long-awaited investment recovery\" hasn't happened. Chote says it is because of weak productivity and low expectations about profits. Over to Parliament now, where experts are chewing over last week's autumn statement at the Treasury committee. The committee will hear from three members of the Office for Budget Responsibility: chairman Robert Chote, as well as Steve Nickell and Graham Parker. You can follow the live session here... although things don't appear to have kicked off yet. Germany's next government has inched a step closer into being, after deputies in Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) voted today to create a grand coalition with the Social Democrats. Speaking at a special party congress, Merkel said the negotiations with the SPD hadn't been easy. She said she had resisted SPD demands for higher taxes and also defended the decision to introduce Germany's first-ever minimum wage. The important thing is that I can say that with this agreement people in Germany will be better off in 2017 than they are now. (Via Reuters) The SPD are not sounding very starry-eyed about the tie-up either. As chairman Sigmar Gabriel said on Sunday This isn't a marriage of love - it's a coalition of reasonable prudence If the SPD vote for the grand coalition Merkel could be sworn in for a third term on 17 December. The newly privatised Royal Mail has reached agreement with the postal workers union on a 9% pay rise over the next three years. How the deal breaks down: 2013-14 3% increase (backdated to 1 April 2013) 2014-15- 3% increase 2015-16 - 2.8% increase, subject to review if inflation is 0.5% or higher Postal workers will also get an early Christmas gift of \u00a3200 before the end of the year. Full details here. The Communication Workers' Union, which is a staunch opponent of privatisation, is recommending members to accept the offer. The union rejected an 8.6% pay increase and a \u00a3300 payment in July. CWU deputy general secretary Dave Ward said it was a good deal, but warned investors in the postal service against a race to the bottom on wages. The agreement breaks new ground in the UK by incorporating extensive legally binding protections for employees alongside a commitment to improve industrial stability. The legal protections for Royal Mail employees come hard on the heels of the privatisation of the company and are unprecedented in delivering the strongest protections for employees. This is a good deal for the company and customers as well as for employees, but investors should be clear that this agreement commits them to growth and there will be no tolerance to a race to the bottom on services and jobs. Political analyst Alberto Nardelli has published his analysis of Matteo Renzi's victory yesterday in the race to lead Italy's Democratic Party, and makes several important points. The first is that 38-year old Renzi -- billed as an Italian \"Tony Blair\"* in some quarters -- will not necessarily be PD's candidate for PM in the next election.Coalition prime minister Enrico Letta could get the nomination. The second point is that Renzi, currently Mayor of Florence, could struggle to maintain his current high popularity if Letta manages to hold his government together until 2015. Alberto explains: A separate vote may well need to take place, and the candidates are likely to be more credible - i.e. Enrico Letta, who would also be a strong candidate in my view, and whose personal ratings are fundamentally in line with Renzi\u2019s. Secondly, the politics - from a Renzi point of view, the sooner an election is held the better. A position that though Renzi fundamentally only shares with Beppe Grillo. All other key players are either in government, or would rather wait. And by billing himself as a great reformer, both of PD and the country, Renzi (who has never served in a national government) faces a huge task. Alberto again: Translating hope into real change is never easy, and even more so in Italy where the crisis is systemic and mold is deeply embedded in the country\u2019s politics, economy and society. A disinfecting reboot of the system will need to go well beyond one person. Here's the full piece: Matteo Renzi is the new leader of the Democratic Party * that's the 1990s Blair, optimistically promising hope and change and radical reform of a discredited political system And that's a good moment to hand over to my colleague Jennifer Rankin to see the blog home. GW A very quiet start to trading on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones index rising just 8 points, or 0.05%. Traders may be braced for several speeches from Federal Reserve members later today. Next week's meeting of the Fed's monetary policy committee is already looming over markets -- after last Friday's Non-Farm Payroll showed more new US jobs created in November than expected. Jonathan Pryor of Investec Corporate Treasury explains: As we turn our attention to the week ahead, the debate about QE tapering remains at the forefront of most analysts minds. For further guidance the market will be closely monitoring the speeches of St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who has said policy makers could taper at this month\u2019s meeting and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher who both speak separately today. Both Lacker and Fisher are considered Fed hawks and if they say something supportive of a December taper, it could trigger dollar buying in the afternoon session. Some European stock markets are also pancake-flat, with the FTSE 100 and the French CAC both down just 0.06% City analysts have been pouring lukewarm water on a report today that banking giant HSBC has considered floating its UK banking arm on the stock market. The Financial Times led its paper edition with the story today, saying HSBC had \"sounded out investors\" about the possibility of unlocking value from its high street banking business. Floating 30% of HSBC's UK arm would also addressing regulatory concerns over the size of the bank, and could even help it move its main HQ away from London. But with HSBC's shares resolutely unmoved today (-0.1%), there's no real reaction to the tale. Yet, anyway. Our City editor Jill Treanor reports: Analysts at Credit Suisse questioned whether a sell-off would help tackle the regulatory requirements. \"Is this going to happen? In the past when we have looked at ring-fencing we have considered whether this would lead to break-up of banks and whether this is ultimately the direction of travel. This is a broader industry discussion and in the end this will depend on the final legislation, but at this stage we are unsure of the merits of such a move.\" More here: Analysts sceptical of reported HSBC flotation in UK It's a worrying day for staff at aerospace giant EADS -- with up to 6,000 jobs being cut across the group. Our transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, reports that the group's HQ in the French capital could also be sold: European aerospace group EADS is planning to cut thousands of jobs and sell its Paris headquarters as part of a large scale restructuring programme. The Airbus owner is expected to announce later on Monday that between 5,000 and 6,000 jobs will go to cut costs according to reports in the French newspaper Le Figaro. The cuts, which would represent around 4% of EADS's 143,000-strong workforce, would be met by voluntary redundancies and transfers, and by not replacing retiring workers or those at the end of temporary contracts, the newspaper said. More here: EADS to cut more than 5,000 jobs and sell Paris headquarters Analysts at BNP Paribas believe the European Central Bank will be forced into a quantitative easing programme in 2014. Despite the \"immense challenges\" which Yves Mersch cited today, BNP reckons the ECB will have to take unconventional action to fight off weak inflation and to stimulate growth. In its new Global Strategy Outlook for 2014, BNP warn that \"the current picture looks rather bleak for Europe\". While the Federal Reserve may be close to slowing its QE programme, the ECB may have to bite the bullet and launch one, BNP said. Here's the key section: Now that Europe seems to be facing the highest risk of deflation, the reaction function of the ECB has to step-up a number of notches. Tackling this is high on the agenda for the ECB, however it has a battle on its hands, as a further refi [interest rate] cut will not be enough. The ECB will have to introduce some other unconventional measures along the lines of QE. That said, its ability to do this will not be straightforward as it will have to convince the Bundestag of the deflationary risks and the need to embark on further unconventional policies to tackle them. And here's a graph from its report: The will-they, won't-they debate over whether the European Central Bank should plunge into quantitative easing took another twist today,with ECB board member Yves Mersch warning it would be extremely tricky. In a speech in Frankfurt, Mersch argued that the ECB could in theory ease monetary policy with a major bond-buying programme, but it would be a huge challenge. In a move that could raise hackles in Southern Europe, Luxembourg's central bank governor also cited Austrian economist Hayek's views that only free markets can price assets correctly. Mersch said: Friedrich August von Hayek said that only the free market could factor all the relevant information into the price and thus ensure a meaningful allocation of assets. He accused social engineers who planned society on the drawing board of displaying a \u201cpretence of knowledge\u201d. The speech looks like an attempt to rebut ECB chief economist Peter Praet, who argued last month that the ECB needed to use more tools to stimulate growth. Mersch explained that, unlike the Japanese, US or UK central banks, there's no single Eurozone government debt for the ECB to target via QE. He added: To define portfolios of government bonds of euro zone member states and then to buy them would pose immense economic, legal and political challenges for the ECB. Mersch also cited problems with two other ways of easing monetary policy: \u2022 He claimed consumers could be hit with higher costs if the ECB imposed negative deposit rates on banks. \u2022 He also argued that the ECB could offer more cheap long-term loans to banks, but that they'd probably use the money to buy sovereign debt (re-enforcing the bank-sovereign interdependence). Mersch concluded by saying that the eurozone was on the way to a gradual recovery. The full speech is online here (in German). UPDATE: and here in English And Reuters has a write-up here. Job-watch: the European Central Bank just tweeted several vacancies, including two division heads and a 'principal production expert' for banknotes: The Netherlands faces a long, tough road back to recovery, its central bank has warned in its latest economic assessment. De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) predicted that Dutch GDP will increase by only 0.5% in 2014. That matches S&amp;P's prediction last month when it stripped the Netherlands of its AAA rating (we liveblogged it here). DNB also sees growth of just 0.9% in 2015, given the weakness of the Dutch economy following its recession and the end of its credit boom. It said: The economic recovery has taken its time in coming and will be limited in scale... because households, banks, pension funds and the government will be busy repairing their battered balance sheets. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has now turned negative as the mining stocks pull the blue-chip index down a little (down 12 points right now). The early optimism over China's 12% rise in exports has withered - here's the biggest fallers this lunchtime: Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, says investors are now more worried that Chinese imports only grew by 5% in October. For the miners, the concern is imports not exports and while import growth continues to lag the demand outlook for the sector weakens, already prompting a sell-off in a resource biased Australian index overnight. This isn\u2019t the first time the FTSE has faced a headwind from the heavyweight miners in the last week, and with major resource futures in the green it makes the move all the more painful for investors. The miners aside there was some cause for optimism, with the Chinese exports beat prompting a rally in emerging markets. Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG, confirms that \"the positivity\" in the European markets has evaporated. News that German factory output fell in October hasn't helped. German industrial output has taken an unexpected drop in October, falling by 1.2% month-on-month. It's the biggest monthly drop since May, and follows a 0.7% drop in September. It surprised analysts who had predicted a 0.8% rise in output. Instead, factories reported that output of capital goods (such as heavy machinery) fell by 3.0%, while durable goods production was down by 4.5%. Germany's finance ministry insists that it's a temporary factor, and that output will improve in coming months. The ministry said (via Reuters) After high output levels in the second and third quarters supported by catch-up effects, output made a weak start to the last quarter. Industrial orders suggest upwards momentum however and construction orders are good. This data comes just hours after Germany reported that exports rose by just 0.2% during October (see earlier post) Confirmation that Portugal has kept out of recession, with the country's statistics body reporting that GDP rose by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That's in line with last month's preliminary reading, and shows that growth was much slower than the 1.1% growth recorded in the second three months of the year. It also means Portugal's economy is still 1% smaller than a year ago, as it moves towards the end of its current bailout programme. Greece has lurched further into deflation, with prices tumbling at the fastest rate recorded as the country's long economic slump continues. The Greek consumer prices index shrank by 2.9% in November, showing deflation accelerated after October's reading of minus 2.0%. Prices in Greece have been falling steadily over the last three years, hitting deflation in April for the first time since records began in the 1960s. This graph tracks Greek CPI (red) against eurozone inflation (blue): Today's data shows that some retailers have slashed prices drastically, having seen demand slide among customers buffeted by austerity cutbacks and record unemployment. Clothing and textile prices tumbled by over 11%, according to national statistics body ELSTAT. Household equipment costs were down 3.7% year-on-year, as this chart shows: Greece's austerity programme has forced wages and pensions down in an attempt to boost competitiveness -- so deflation has not come as a surprise. It could even be taken as a sign that the Troika's plan is having its intended effect. The damage wrecked on the wider Greek economy rather undermines the argument that deflation's a good thing, though, especially as Athens isn't able to inflate away some of its national debt. We've also heard confirmation this morning that the Greek economy shank by 3% on a year-on-year basis in Q3, which confirms that the five-year recession is easing. Back to Japan, where economic growth in the last quarter has been disappointingly revised down to just 0.3% (see 8.50am) this morning. Some analysts are concerned that prime minister Abe's economic recovery plan is faltering. Chris Williamson of Markit, though, says latest data suggests growth has picked up since, and tweets this graph: We've already had one piece of better news from Japan this morning -- service sector activity rose in November, with companies saying they're more optimistic about future prospects.. But on the other hand.....there is also concern that Japan posted a surprise current account deficit in October for the second month in a row. That's not happened since the mid-1980s, according to Societe Generale's Kit Juckes: Japan's current account was in deficit on a seasonally adjusted basis in both September and October, the first time it has been in deficit for two consecutive months since pre-1985. Back in the stock markets, the Indian Sensex has hit a new all-time high today, after the country's opposition party was victorious in state elections over the weekend. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a majority in three out of four states, suggests they could oust Manmohan Singh's government in next year's general election. Narendra Modi, prime ministerial candidate for the the pro-business BJP, took to Twitter yesterday to declare: BJP's victory across the states is spectacular fastFT have more analysis here, arguing that any new administration could give India's economy a much-needed jolt. Cyprus's finance minister has hinted that the country's punishing capital controls could finally be lifted in spring 2014, a year after the restrictions were imposed as part of its bailout package. Harris Georgiades has been speaking to a few reporters in Brussels, ahead of today's meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Peter Spiegel of the FT and Matina Stevis of the WSJ have tweeted the key points: Currently, Cypriots are still barred from taking large sums of money out of the bank, or sending significant funds abroad. More key points from the briefing: Weaker investment by Japanese companies meant its economy grew rather less strongly than expected in the last quarter, as AP explains: Japan slashed its estimate of economic growth for the July-to-September quarter on Monday as investment by companies slowed more than first estimated. The government said the world's third-largest economy grew by an annualised 1.1% last quarter, less than half the pace of the previous quarter. The initial estimate had put growth at 1.9%. Prime minister Shinzo Abe's economic revival strategy for Japan centers on cheap credit, a weak yen and longer-term reforms to boost competitiveness, but corporate investment and personal incomes have yet to rebound. Meanwhile, exports have grown less than expected despite the weaker yen, partly due to slowing growth in many emerging economies More here: Japanese economic growth lower than expected The German stock market is up 0.5% in early trading, as this morning's latest trade data is digested. Here's the early picture (green means the indices have risen): The latest German trade data, though, shows welcome signs of rebalancing within the eurozone. German imports rose 2.9% in October, while exports increased by just 0.2%. That left Germany with a trade surplus of \u20ac16.8bn for the month, less than the \u20ac18.0bn economists had expected. This data, which is seasonally adjusted, could indicate that German consumers are spending more -- alleviating concerns that Germany's economic muscle is sucking in demand and making Europe's economic crisis worse (something the European Commission is now investigating). Stefan Schilbe, an economist from HSBC Trinkaus, explains (via Reuters): Investment is recovering and households are spending more. This means imports are outpacing exports... and we are now no longer seeing growth based so exclusively on exports. Trade partners are benefiting from recovery in Germany. They are delivering more intermediate goods like steel or machinery parts to Germany.. the trade balance will not be so high in future. However, if you strip out seasonal factors, German exporters actually sold more goods than ever before in a single month -- worth \u20ac99.1bn in total. More here: German Oct trade surplus narrows, gives euro zone cheer Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of event across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. There's an cautiously optimistic mood in the stock markets this morning, after the latest Chinese trade data showed a surge in exports last month. European stock markets are inching higher on a dank morning in London, with traders warmed by the news that China's trade surplus swelled to its highest level in almost five years. The Chinese surplus rose to $33.8bn in November, from $31.1bn in October. It was driven by a 12.7% bounce in exports, to $202.2bn, which is bolstering hopes that global demand is picking up as Christmas approaches. As Louis Kuijs of RBS put it: There are signs that the global activity and trade cycle is gaining momentum, driven by the recovery in high income countries. There's also lingering optimism that America's labour market is picking up, after Friday's jobs data (non-farm payroll) beat forecasts. Imports, though only rise 5.3% year on year - thus the increased surplus. That suggests there is only limited progress in rebalancing the Chinese economy towards consumption. Ma Xiaoping, an HSBC economist, commented: \"Imports were disappointing. Domestic demand is still tepid.\" A wider Chinese trade surplus is likely to antagonise those US politicians who claim Beijing is deliberately skewing the global trade playing field with an unfairly weak currency. But right now, the rise in exports is taking the spotlight. Patrick Latchford at Monex Capital Markets comments: That upbeat payroll reading from the US on Friday and some healthy trade figures out of China have combined to make it an impressive start to the week for Asian equities. The Japanese Nikkei has already surged 2.2% overnight, with stocks rallying as the yen weakened against the dollar. That comes after Japanese growth for the last quarter was downgraded overnight, from 0.5% to just 0.3%. This could trigger another stimulus package from Tokyo. Spain's IBEX is the best performer in Europe, up 0.4%, with the other indices all up in early trading. A calm start to the day then. I'll be tracking all the developments, including the latest situation in Greece and reaction to the political news out of Italy -- that Matteo Renzi, mayor of Florence, has won the race to lead Italy's center-left Democratic Party.....",

      "bodyText": "European aerospace group EADS is planning to cut thousands of jobs and sell its Paris headquarters as part of a large-scale restructuring programme. The Airbus owner is expected to announce later on Monday that between 5,000 and 6,000 jobs will go to cut costs, according to reports in the French newspaper Le Figaro. The cuts, which would represent around 4% of EADS's 143,000-strong workforce, would be met by voluntary redundancies and transfers, and by not replacing retiring workers or those at the end of temporary contracts, the newspaper said. It is understood that an announcement will be made after markets close on Monday. It follows the decision announced in July to rename the company Airbus Group from January 2014 and to split the group into three divisions. Airbus Military, space division Astrium, and cyber-security business Cassidian will be merged into one defence and space division and headquartered in Munich as part of the plans. The group's two other divisions will be Airbus, the commercial aircraft business, and Airbus Helicopters, comprising all commercial and military helicopter work. EADS said the restructuring process should be completed in the second half of 2014. \"Pooling the space and defence entities Airbus Military, Astrium and Cassidian is the group's response to the changing market environment with flat or even shrinking defence and space budgets in the western hemisphere,\" it said in July. \"This structural change will provide optimised market access, cost and market synergies and improved competitiveness overall.\" The company's main bases are France, Germany, Spain and the UK, although it is thought Britain will not be a major focus for job cuts. EADS employs around 17,500 people in the UK across 32 locations, with a turnover of almost \u00a33bn. Last year EADS's chief executive, Tom Enders, was forced to abandon a planned \u20ac35bn (\u00a329bn) merger with British defence giant BAE Systems after German chancellor Angela Merkel personally blocked the deal.",

Carr has said the amount needed to keep Holden\u2019s Australian manufacturing in Australia is less than $150m a year \u2013 out of a total $300m a year in additional car manufacturing assistance \u2013 and contends the government is \u201cdriving General Motors out of Australia\u201d by refusing to announce its stance on this future car industry assistance. The contingency reserve as outlined in budget papers does not break down different purposes for which money may have been deposited in it, but Carr insists the former government set aside the funding as part of a deal with the company before the election.

The industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, points to the company\u2019s public statements that no formal decision has been made on its future in Australia and says the government will make a decision about long-term assistance after the Productivity Commission delivers an interim report in December and a final report next March. He is trying to convince cabinet colleagues to allow him to develop a new car plan \u2013 with requirements that the companies invest and export Australian-made models \u2013 using the money set aside in the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which runs until 2020. But some federal ministers have long indicated privately that they believe the company has already made an informal decision to leave, no matter what the government does, and are concerned that if the announcement is left until after the commission\u2019s report early next year the government will be blamed for a decision that has already been taken.

These showed that manufacturing continues to decline in overall importance but that also the car industry is not the productivity sloth it is often portrayed.</p> <p>The manufacturing industry has now been declining for 40 years. Back in 1974 (when the ABS began measuring gross value added by each industry) manufacturing accounted for 15% of our GDP, and was more than double the size of the mining and construction industries which were tied for second biggest:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics http://cf.datawrapper.de/xKcvl/5/\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/xKcvl/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/xKcvl/5/\">Link to view graphic on mobile</a></p> <p>Now mining, construction, and financial services are all bigger than manufacturing. The health care and social services industry and the professional, scientific and technical services industry are now effectively the same size as the manufacturing industry.</p> <p>The decline in the share of GDP has been accompanied by a decline in its share of the labour market. Where once it was easily the biggest employer, now it is only the 5th biggest. Since 1984 the number of males employed full-time in the manufacturing industry has gone from one in five to about one in eight.</p> <p>The national accounts also show that the industry was hit harder by the GFC than any other in Australia.</p> <p>From 2000 until the GFC in June 2008, manufacturing contributed an above average 1.8 percentage points to GDP growth. Since June 2008 however, the industry has actually been a drag on GDP growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics http://cf.datawrapper.de/jQ3eO/1/\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/jQ3eO/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/jQ3eO/1/\">Link to view graphic on mobile </a></p> <p>This decline in total manufacturing growth was noted by the Australian Industry Group (AIG) in<a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/inquiry/automotive/submissions\"> its submission</a> to the productivity commission\u2019s review of the automobile industry. It noted that as of June 2013, total manufacturing output (value added) was 9.8% lower than at its last peak in June 2008, and just 0.9% higher than during the GFC trough in Q3 2009.</p> <p>Among the reasons for the decline in manufacturing output are the worldwide decline in demand for manufactured products since the GFC, a downturn in the construction industry (and thus a drop in local demand for manufactured products) and (as ever) the high Australian dollar.</p> <p>AIG suggested that the current weak conditions of the manufacturing industry would mean it \u201cdoes not appear to be readily able to \u2018absorb\u2019 tens of thousands of workers who might be displaced from the automotive sector, should automotive production be reduced or removed from Australia by changes to industry policy.\u201d</p> <p>The argument that we should save the car industry because the rest of the manufacturing sector is not doing well is pretty weak. What might be a better point to argue is that far from being an unproductive sector of the economy, the automotive industry has outperformed the rest of the manufacturing industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Ybr5G/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/Ybr5G/1/\">Link to view graphic on mobile</a></p> <p>The productivity commission\u2019s working paper on productivity in the manufacturing industry found that the machinery and equipment sub-section \u2013 a large part of which represents car manufacture \u2013 has continually outperformed the rest of the manufacturing industry over the past 25 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/1LLl9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/1LLl9/1/\">Link to view graphic on mobile</a></p> <p>The commission\u2019s report also highlighted just how difficult it is to nail down a reason for the decline of productivity growth \u2013 even at the industry level, let alone for the whole of the economy.</p> <p>It noted that the decline in manufacturing multi-factor productivity (MFP) from 2003 to 2011 was the longest such decline since 1985.

      "bodyText": "The report last week that Holden may be planning to stop manufacturing here in 2016 coincided with the release of the national accounts and a productivity commission working paper. These showed that manufacturing continues to decline in overall importance but that also the car industry is not the productivity sloth it is often portrayed. The manufacturing industry has now been declining for 40 years. Back in 1974 (when the ABS began measuring gross value added by each industry) manufacturing accounted for 15% of our GDP, and was more than double the size of the mining and construction industries which were tied for second biggest: Link to view graphic on mobile Now mining, construction, and financial services are all bigger than manufacturing. The health care and social services industry and the professional, scientific and technical services industry are now effectively the same size as the manufacturing industry. The decline in the share of GDP has been accompanied by a decline in its share of the labour market. Where once it was easily the biggest employer, now it is only the 5th biggest. Since 1984 the number of males employed full-time in the manufacturing industry has gone from one in five to about one in eight. The national accounts also show that the industry was hit harder by the GFC than any other in Australia. From 2000 until the GFC in June 2008, manufacturing contributed an above average 1.8 percentage points to GDP growth. Since June 2008 however, the industry has actually been a drag on GDP growth. Link to view graphic on mobile This decline in total manufacturing growth was noted by the Australian Industry Group (AIG) in its submission to the productivity commission\u2019s review of the automobile industry. It noted that as of June 2013, total manufacturing output (value added) was 9.8% lower than at its last peak in June 2008, and just 0.9% higher than during the GFC trough in Q3 2009. Among the reasons for the decline in manufacturing output are the worldwide decline in demand for manufactured products since the GFC, a downturn in the construction industry (and thus a drop in local demand for manufactured products) and (as ever) the high Australian dollar. AIG suggested that the current weak conditions of the manufacturing industry would mean it \u201cdoes not appear to be readily able to \u2018absorb\u2019 tens of thousands of workers who might be displaced from the automotive sector, should automotive production be reduced or removed from Australia by changes to industry policy.\u201d The argument that we should save the car industry because the rest of the manufacturing sector is not doing well is pretty weak. What might be a better point to argue is that far from being an unproductive sector of the economy, the automotive industry has outperformed the rest of the manufacturing industry. Link to view graphic on mobile The productivity commission\u2019s working paper on productivity in the manufacturing industry found that the machinery and equipment sub-section \u2013 a large part of which represents car manufacture \u2013 has continually outperformed the rest of the manufacturing industry over the past 25 years: Link to view graphic on mobile The commission\u2019s report also highlighted just how difficult it is to nail down a reason for the decline of productivity growth \u2013 even at the industry level, let alone for the whole of the economy. It noted that the decline in manufacturing multi-factor productivity (MFP) from 2003 to 2011 was the longest such decline since 1985. But the commission was at a bit of a loss as to why this had occurred. It was however able to attribute two thirds of the decline to three sub-sectors: petroleum, coal, chemical and rubber products; food, beverage and tobacco products; and metal products. It failed to find any connection between productivity and profitability as is the case with the mining sector where increased profitability increased work in less productive activities. It failed to find a link between falling productivity and decline in research and development as \u201cthere was no significant fall in R&amp;D expenditure in the period preceding [the decline].\u201d The most likely culprit was a decline in capital utilisation \u2013 ie capital/equipment wasn\u2019t being used to its full potential. This was clearly shown in the latest MFP data released on Friday: Link to view graph on mobile None of this will be likely to save the car industry. That will in the end come down to General Motors maximising its global profits. But if it does go, it won\u2019t be because of below par labour productivity.
