      "bodyText": "A federal judge on Thursday pressed Volkswagen to find a way to fix its dirty diesel cars that are still on the roadways. \u201c600,000 vehicles are on the road today, out of compliance,\u201d said US district Judge Charles Breyer at a hearing in San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing harm that has to be addressed, and that gives a sense of urgency.\u201d He set 24 March as the date for Volkswagen and the Environmental Protection Agency to report back as to whether a solution was forthcoming and what it might look like. The automaker has been under fire since revelations last September that it had installed software on diesel cars that allowed them to cheat on pollution tests. With the software, the diesel cars can meet America\u2019s strict pollution standards while in the laboratory, even though the cars continue to produce excessive pollution \u2013 up to 40 times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxides \u2013 on the roadways. Some 11m cars are affected worldwide, with 600,000 in America. The judge said that Volkswagen already had enough time to come up with a fix for dirty cars and it was time to move forward, even if the solution was not perfect. \u201cSix months is long enough to determine whether or not there is an engineering process that would be accepted by Volkswagen,\u201d Breyer said, adding: \u201cThere is a deadline, and the deadline is before March 24th.\u201d Robert Giuffra Jr, an attorney representing Volkswagen, said that the company was in close discussions about solutions with the EPA, the Department of Justice and the California air resources board, which must also sign off on a fix. While talks were making progress, Giuffra said, he was not at liberty yet to share details. \u201cWe are obviously working very hard,\u201d with multiple meetings in Washington, DC, and around the nation, Giuffra said. The judge said he did not yet have an opinion on what a solution should look like but wanted to move forward as rapidly as possible. Breyer has named former FBI director Robert Mueller to oversee settlement discussions, and on Thursday he said it was important for Mueller to meet with top management of Volkswagen. One possible, albeit very expensive, fix is that Volkswagen could buy back non-compliant diesel cars from their owners. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Volkswagen over its cheating software. The class-action suits are consolidated in the court of Breyer, who is the brother of US supreme court Justice Stephen Breyer. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint runs more than 700 pages and accuses Volkswagen of \u201cone of the most brazen corporate crimes in history\u201d. The courtroom on Thursday morning was close to half full, with about 40 people in the audience.",

      "bodyText": "The company demolishing the defunct Didcot power station in Oxfordshire, where at least one person died on Tuesday, had not previously worked on a power station. The Birmingham-based Coleman Group was awarded the contract to dismantle the Didcot A coal and gas-fired station by RWE npower. The power station collapsed Tuesday afternoon while its workers were preparing the structure for demolition. Another three workers remain missing and are thought to have died, while a further five were injured and more than 47 others were treated for dust inhalation. Kieran Conaty, project director for the demolition project, said in a Coleman &amp; Company video posted online in December that RWE knew it was the first time the company had dismantled a power station. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything like this, but we are that type of a company that we learn to adapt, and we tried to bring in some expertise,\u201d he said. The focus was on ensuring that the project was finished safely, on time and on budget, Conaty said in the video. The company had been working on the site since March 2012 and had demolished the tank and bunker bay there late September. Colman workers had been preparing the boiler house for demolition when it collapsed on Tuesday. An RWE spokesman said that Coleman &amp; Company had been appointed after a thorough and robust process. \u201cOur contractor for Didcot A power station is known as one of the UK\u2019s leading demolition specialists, successfully carrying out controlled and complex demolition projects and have been in business for over 50 years,\u201d he said. Coleman &amp; Company declined to comment. Its other projects include the demolition of four redundant gas holders at the Battersea power station site in central London for National Grid. The cause of the Didcot collapse is still unknown and Thames Valley police and the Health and Safety Executive are conducting an investigation. On Thursday heavy engineering, cranes and lifting equipment arrived at the scene as rescue teams continued to examine the 30ft debris pile at the site. The families of the three people still unaccounted for have visited the scene. Emergency crews said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d they would still be alive. Dave Etheridge, chief fire officer of Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: \u201cOur priority remains to recover those missing but the site remains extremely unstable \u2013 both the collapsed structure and the remaining building which has already been primed and cut for demolition. \u201cIt is likely that a further collapse is possible and so the safety of the teams working on site has to be our first consideration. We are continuing to work closely with structural engineers and demolition experts to establish a safe way of working on the site. We anticipate that this exercise will be prolonged and difficult.\u201d Didcot A opened in 1970 as a coal-fired power station and was later adapted to burn natural gas as well. It closed in March 2013 and hundreds of onlookers watched as three of its enormous cooling towers were blown up in July the following year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Has Sharon White at Ofcom flunked it by declining to order an immediate breakup of BT? No. The argument for liberating Openreach \u2013 as advocated by Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk \u2013 was always too full of wishful thinking. There are many reasons to bemoan BT\u2019s performance in broadband but abolishing one monopoly supplier to create another monopoly supplier would have achieved little in itself. An independent Openreach, loaded with a chunk of pension liabilities, might have chosen to sweat its old copper assets just as intensely as critics say BT does. Competition would not have been advanced one jot. Even more heavier-handed regulation might have been required to improve the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure. White is sensibly retaining the breakup option and thus waving a weapon at BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to discourage foot-dragging. But, for now, the focus is on encouraging rivals to invest in competing fibre cables while injecting accountability into Openreach. It is a good, pragmatic choice. First, BT will have to allow rivals to build their own fibre networks by opening up Openreach\u2019s underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. Second, there will be heavier fines if Openreach misses service standards. Third, Openreach will have an independent board. The opening up of the infrastructure is the most important innovation. BT reacted by shrugging its shoulders and saying rivals have had that right since 2009 and few have bothered to use it. Ofcom counters that life will be different in future: fibre enthusiasts will enjoy easy access and lower costs and be allowed to make decent returns. Much depends on the regulator getting its sums right. But, if it has, there is the chance of a proper contest, to the benefit of consumers. Sky will no longer have to grumble that BT is wedding everyone to a \u201cslow lane\u201d copper-based future. It will be able to exploit its rival\u2019s lack of vision by betting on ultrafast fibre and scooping the winnings. Go for it. Ofcom\u2019s other two main prescriptions for Openreach will have to pass a real-world test. Penalties advertised as \u201csubstantial\u201d must bite. And the new arm\u2019s-length governance set-up \u2013 a separate board and investment budget \u2013 must avoid the endless wrangling seen in the banking sector over ringfencing. But Ofcom\u2019s basic thinking is correct. More competition for Openreach, not a messy divorce from BT, sounds a quicker way to upgrade the country\u2019s broadband. Paying dividend pays dividend for Lloyds bosses It\u2019s easy to look pretty in today\u2019s banking sector. All you have to do, it seems, is pay a dividend that investors can believe in. It worked for Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday as a \u00a32bn distribution to shareholders was greeted with a 13% surge in the share price. The market\u2019s excitement was odd because Lloyds did little more than it had previously pledged on dividends. Perhaps investors were worried that the Bank of England, at the 11th hour and amid the Brexit brouhaha, would insist that more capital should be retained. As it is, Lloyds\u2019 2.25p-a-share ordinary dividend (ignoring the 0.5p special) offers a yield of 3.2%. Not bad by recent standards, but there was nothing in Lloyds\u2019 actual trading figures for 2015 to indicate old-fashioned growth. Pre-tax profits actually fell 7% to \u00a31.64bn, dragged down by yet another thumping provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Net income was virtually flat. And boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said he won\u2019t achieve his desired cost-to-income ratio until the end of 2019, about two years later than planned. One of the culprits for the latter was \u201cthe lower for longer interest rate environment\u201d. That\u2019s not going away soon. PPI provisions will, Lloyds hopes, but the lending climate in the UK looks downright dull. Even at Lloyds\u2019 preferred \u201cunderlying\u201d level \u2013 in other words, ignoring the nasties \u2013 profits were only up 5% to \u00a38.1bn. That was in a good year for the UK economy; the weather could turn rougher. On the bright side, there are worse prospects than dull market leadership, especially when it is endorsed by a disgracefully tame competition regulator. The alternative investment choices for bank investors are litigation hell (HSBC), investment banking befuddlement (Barclays) or a bag of uncertainties (Royal Bank of Scotland). There is a separate question of whether Horta-Os\u00f3rio and colleagues, now that they have taken Lloyds out of the emergency ward, still need to be paid danger money. The long-term incentive plan for 2016 awards \u00a320m-worth of shares to 11 individuals. That is more than generous given the rewards already reaped.",

No. The argument for liberating Openreach \u2013 as advocated by Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk \u2013 was always too full of wishful thinking.</p> <p>There are many reasons to bemoan BT\u2019s performance in broadband but abolishing one monopoly supplier to create another monopoly supplier would have achieved little in itself. </p> <p>An independent Openreach, loaded with a chunk of pension liabilities, might have chosen to sweat its old copper assets just as intensely as critics say BT does. Competition would not have been advanced one jot. Even more heavier-handed regulation might have been required to improve the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure.</p> <p>White is sensibly retaining the breakup option and thus waving a weapon at BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to discourage foot-dragging. But, for now, the focus is on encouraging rivals to invest in competing fibre cables while injecting accountability into Openreach. It is a good, pragmatic choice.</p> <p>First, BT will have to allow rivals to build their own fibre networks by opening up Openreach\u2019s underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. Second, there will be heavier fines if Openreach misses service standards. Third, Openreach will have an independent board.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/ng-interactive/2016/feb/23/forget-superfast-missing-basic-broadband-infographic-economic-impact\">Forget superfast, look who's missing basic broadband \u2013\u00a0infographic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The opening up of the infrastructure is the most important innovation. BT reacted by shrugging its shoulders and saying rivals have had that right since 2009 and few have bothered to use it. </p> <p>Ofcom counters that life will be different in future: fibre enthusiasts will enjoy easy access and lower costs and be allowed to make decent returns.</p> <p>Much depends on the regulator getting its sums right. But, if it has, there is the chance of a proper contest, to the benefit of consumers. Sky will no longer have to grumble that BT is wedding everyone to a \u201cslow lane\u201d copper-based future. It will be able to exploit its rival\u2019s lack of vision by betting on ultrafast fibre and scooping the winnings. Go for it.</p> <p>Ofcom\u2019s other two main prescriptions for Openreach will have to pass a real-world test. Penalties advertised as \u201csubstantial\u201d must bite. And the new arm\u2019s-length governance set-up \u2013 a separate board and investment budget \u2013 must avoid the endless wrangling seen in the banking sector over ringfencing. </p> <p>But Ofcom\u2019s basic thinking is correct. More competition for Openreach, not a messy divorce from BT, sounds a quicker way to upgrade the country\u2019s broadband.</p> <h2>Paying dividend pays dividend for Lloyds bosses</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to look pretty in today\u2019s banking sector. All you have to do, it seems, is pay a dividend that investors can believe in. It worked for Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/lloyds-hands-chief-executive-85m-pay-package\">a \u00a32bn distribution to shareholders</a> was greeted with a 13% surge in the share price.</p> <p>The market\u2019s excitement was odd because Lloyds did little more than it had previously pledged on dividends. Perhaps investors were worried that the Bank of England, at the 11th hour and amid the Brexit brouhaha, would insist that more capital should be retained.</p> <p>As it is, Lloyds\u2019 2.25p-a-share ordinary dividend (ignoring the 0.5p special) offers a yield of 3.2%. Not bad by recent standards, but there was nothing in Lloyds\u2019 actual trading figures for 2015 to indicate old-fashioned growth.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits actually fell 7% to \u00a31.64bn, dragged down by yet another thumping provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Net income was virtually flat. And boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said he won\u2019t achieve his desired cost-to-income ratio until the end of 2019, about two years later than planned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/lloyds-hands-chief-executive-85m-pay-package\">Lloyds hands chief executive \u00a38.5m pay package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the culprits for the latter was \u201cthe lower for longer interest rate environment\u201d. That\u2019s not going away soon. PPI provisions will, Lloyds hopes, but the lending climate in the UK looks downright dull. </p> <p>Even at Lloyds\u2019 preferred \u201cunderlying\u201d level \u2013 in other words, ignoring the nasties \u2013 profits were only up 5% to \u00a38.1bn. That was in a good year for the UK economy; the weather could turn rougher.</p> <p>On the bright side, there are worse prospects than dull market leadership, especially when it is endorsed by a disgracefully tame competition regulator. The alternative investment choices for bank investors are litigation hell (HSBC), investment banking befuddlement (Barclays) or a bag of uncertainties (Royal Bank of Scotland).</p> <p>There is a separate question of whether Horta-Os\u00f3rio and colleagues, now that they have taken Lloyds out of the emergency ward, still need to be paid danger money. </p> <p>The long-term incentive plan for 2016 awards \u00a320m-worth of shares to 11 individuals. That is more than generous given the rewards already reaped.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK would lose its top credit score if the public voted to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said in a fresh warning on Thursday. The only big credit ratings agency to award Britain the highest AAA ranking renewed its warning over the UK\u2019s economic prospects outside the EU after David Cameron fired the starting gun on referendum campaigning last weekend. A senior director at the ratings agency, which assigns credit scores to debt issued by governments around the world, said a Brexit vote \u201ccertainly could\u201d affect Britain\u2019s rating, when interviewed by Bloomberg Television. Such a downgrade would push up the UK\u2019s government borrowing costs and hurt its standing in international markets. Moritz Kraemer, chief ratings officer for S&amp;P, echoed warnings made earlier this week from rival agencies Fitch and Moody\u2019s over the UK\u2019s credit rating in the event of a leave vote. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite unambiguous saying that if Britain leaves the EU, the sovereign rating would go down by at least a notch,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cRemember we still rate the UK AAA with a negative outlook. We think that Britain has been benefiting from EU membership; Britain has been one of the magnets for inbound investment, not only from the rest of the EU but globally. \u201cIt\u2019s our belief that a big part of this attraction of Britain, among other things, is that it\u2019s a member of the EU and it\u2019s therefore an integral part of the largest trading area in the world.\u201d Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s had previously flagged risks from the referendum to the UK\u2019s financial services sector, its exports, and the wider economy. That statement in December warned that \u201ca UK departure from the EU would likely lead us to lower the rating\u201d. Asked on Thursday about the size of a potential downgrade, Kraemer said it \u201creally depends on the circumstances\u201d. \u201cIt depends on what would come next, because the easy part would be to vote to leave, but the difficult part would be then to negotiate something else that would come in its place,\u201d he told Bloomberg. Such a renegotiation process could take several years, given that any deal would need to be approved by all EU members, said Kraemer. \u201cDepending on what the political realities look like, and with a lot of tension in the EU even today, you know, the outcome might actually be worse than a one notch downgrade would suggest.\u201d On Monday, Moody\u2019s put the government on alert that a decision to leave the EU could lead to a downgrade of the UK\u2019s strong credit score. It said the outcome of the referendum \u201cremains too close to call\u201d but that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, the economic costs would outweigh the benefits. The UK is rated Aa1 by Moody\u2019s, one notch below the top triple-A score. Fitch, which cut its rating on the UK to a notch below the top AAA level in 2013, said on Monday that leaving the EU would bring short-term disruption and long-term risks for the UK. The International Monetary Fund has warned that Britain\u2019s steady growth could be jeopardised by the uncertainty in the runup to the referendum.",

Other reported bidders were the Chinese transport company HNA and another Canadian consortium, as the price for the capital\u2019s smallest airport exceeded early expectations. The value of the airport, which serves around four million passengers a year, has rocketed over the past two decades. Global Infrastructure Partners, its owner until now, also has Gatwick and Edinburgh in its portfolio. It paid a third of that price a decade ago to buy the airport from Irish businessman Dermot Desmond, who had purchased it in 1995 for just \u00a323.5m. It was an investment that had been considered risky while Canary Wharf, a major source of business passengers, was in administration. The Ontario Teachers and Borealis consortium also included Aimco and Wren House, while the defeated Canadian consortium included PSP Investments, a pension fund that covers the country\u2019s mounted police. Expansion plans for the central London airport have been blocked by the mayor, Boris Johnson. City airport is appealing against Johnson\u2019s decision to block its proposed \u00a3200m expansion plan, which would have doubled its passenger traffic by 2030, extending the terminal and airfield to allow 50% more flights.

Walsh said he could not see how any buyer could \u201crecover or make any return on that investment unless they make significant increases in airport charges\u201d. The price tag dwarfs the \u00a31.5bn paid by Manchester Airports Group for Stansted two years ago, which carries more than five times as many passengers and has permission to double that number.

      "bodyText": "A group representing 60 local authorities has warned that recent closures of large power stations have left Britain heading for power cuts next winter, despite assurances to the contrary from the government. The Industrial Communities Alliance (ICA), an all-party association of councils from across Britain, said National Grid needed to act immediately to fill the supply gap by sending out new contracts for at least 2,500 megawatts (MW) of additional generating capacity \u2013 enough to power 2.5m homes. The alliance wants ministers to reconsider the level of carbon taxes, saying this is one of the key reasons why so many coal-fired power stations are being shut down early. Five plants, including Longannet, Ferrybridge and Rugeley, representing 7,000 MW of electricity-generating capacity, were available this winter but would not be fully in action by the end of the year, the group said. \u201cThe problem \u2013 and it is a problem for every electricity consumer in the country \u2013 is that if all these closures go ahead, there won\u2019t be enough generating capacity to keep the lights on next winter,\u201d said the ICA in a briefing document entitled Lights Out! It continued: \u201cBeyond the five power stations under threat, there are five more coal-fired power stations left on the grid \u2013 Aberthaw, Cottam, Drax, Ratcliffe and West Burton. How long before they too are proposed for closure?\u201d In recent years, coal, nuclear and gas-fired plants have been shut because of low prices, high operating costs or old age. Windfarms have been erected and new nuclear facilities promised but energy companies say gas plants cannot be built without higher subsidies. Engie, the owner of Rugeley coal-fired station in Staffordshire, which made the most recent closure announcement earlier this month, blamed low wholesale power prices as much as carbon taxes for its decision. The alliance noted that late last year, the National Grid introduced a system of contracts to keep voluntary capacity in reserve, but it did not believe enough had been done. This leaves the power system \u201cperilously exposed\u201d to plant breakdowns, cold spells or calm weather that cuts output from wind turbines, the local authorities said, and this could hurt jobs as well as consumers. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) denied blackouts were looming. \u201cWe are clear that providing a secure supply of affordable energy for our families and businesses is non-negotiable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no impact on this winter and action has already been taken to secure extra capacity for next winter. We will continue to work alongside National Grid and Ofgem [the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets] to take whatever additional steps are necessary to protect our energy supply.\u201d The same message came from National Grid, a private sector company which has responsibility for balancing demand and supply. \u201cWe continue to work closely with industry, Decc and Ofgem and have already concluded successful tenders for an extra 3,600MW of [reserve power] for the winter of 2016-17 as well as continuing to focus on growing [demand reduction] activities,\u201d a spokesman said. Ofgem said: \u201cWe are confident that electricity supplies will be secure next winter but there is no room for complacency. There are a range of tools to manage the electricity system. \u201cNational Grid will be conducting its detailed review of energy security for next winter in due course. National Grid\u2019s review will take into consideration all relevant factors.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Despite continuing falls in oil prices, the rally in European markets stayed the course. Putting aside worries about China, faltering global growth and volatile commodity prices, investors took heart from a series of positive company updates, not least Lloyds Banking Group, RSA Insurance, Axa and Deutsche Telekom. Wall Street managed to shake off some early uncertainty by the time Europe closed, but there is likely to be further nervousness around the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai which starts later. For the moment, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 145.63 points or 2.48% higher at 6012.81 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.79% to 9331.48 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.24% higher at 4248.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.3% at 17,104.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.52% higher at 8215.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.05% to 483.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has been suggested that with QE and low (and in some cases negative) interest rates, central banks risk running out of ammunition to boost the global economy. But Capital Economics disagrees. The research company\u2019s Nikita Shah said: There is undoubtedly less scope for policy easing than there was a few years ago, but the charge that central banks are now powerless is, in our view, exaggerated. For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies. What could these more radical policies be: Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation. But policymakers have proven that they are willing to change course if they are consistently missing their mandates. And if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, political opposition to such policies would surely soften. The price of crude continues to slide. Earlier, data from the US showed stockpiles at the Cushing hub in Oklahoma for oil deliveries has reached new highs. Inventories rose by 503,000 barrels to more than 67.5m barrels between 19 and 24 February, according to Reuters. Brent crude is now down 2.3% at $33.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3%. The UK Treasury is not drawing up plans to deal with the fallout if Britain leaves the EU after the forthcoming referendum. Attending a conference on market liquidity, Charles Roxburgh, director general for financial services at the Treasury, said: It\u2019s the government\u2019s policy not to do contingency planning. So we will not be doing contingency planning \u2014 that\u2019s consistent with the position we had on Scotland. The contingency planning is instead being done by the Bank of England. After a bright start, US markets have slipped back after another drop in the oil price, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up just 12 points. But European markets have held on to much of their gains and are still up around 2%. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at their afternoon highs the FTSE, DAX and CAC have kept up a staggering pace this Thursday; the Dow Jones, meanwhile, has lagged far behind, US investors not quite as eager to pour back into the market as their European peers... It is interesting to see such divergence between the two regions, especially the chasm in trading sentiment currently separating the FTSE and the Dow. Both have a tendency to be weighed down by their respective commodity sectors, the latter seeing an especially volatile session last night thanks to the choppy movements in the oil price. Yet whilst the UK oil and mining stocks (bar the odd anomaly like Rio Tinto and Premier Oil) are largely in the green, ignoring Brent Crude\u2019s latest decline, their US counterparts are far more bearish this Thursday, Chevron (down 1.5%), ExxonMobil (slipping around 0.8%) and Caterpillar (falling roughly 1%) all preventing the Dow from joining the day\u2019s rebound. It appears that the US index is sorely missing the earnings-focused gains the FTSE has seen today, with the incredible, dividend driven, performances of Lloyds and RSA Insurance helping overcome any potential negative sentiment following a rough Asian session. Tomorrow, however, does see the US shift back into the limelight after the UK GDP and Eurozone inflation focused trading of Thursday. Not that that will necessarily be a good thing; already coming in at a disappointing annualised rate of 0.7% for the fourth quarter, Friday\u2019s second estimate US GDP figure is set to drop to 0.4%, something that may only exacerbate the Dow\u2019s current dreariness. After a rebound in US markets late in Wednesday\u2019s session, the trend is continuing in early trading. Taking its lead from a bounce in Europe - helped by well received results from financial groups Lloyds, RSA Insurance and Axa - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 72 points or 0.4%. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.2% and Nasdaq 0.27% at the open. Over in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 2.6% - back above the 6000 level - while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.67%. Part of the reason for a tumble on Wednesday, before Wall Street\u2019s late revival, was a falling oil price on growing US inventories and further consideration of Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments suggesting producers were unlikely to cut output. But crude prices have stabilised to give some support to markets, with Brent down just 0.4% at $34.26 a barrel. But the durable goods data is more mixed than it first appears, says Rob Carnell at ING, and gives no reason for an early rate rise: US durable goods orders data showed a strong rebound in January, rising 4.9% month on month against expectations for a rise of only 2.9%. And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag. However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed. With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations. It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move. Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. In its economic projections back in December the central bank pencilled in 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. That would be hard to stomach given the market turmoil since the beginning of the year. Sticking with America.... and US factories have just reported a surge in demand for machinery and heavy-duty equipment last month. It suggests the US economy is stronger than some economists feared . Orders for US capital goods jumped by 4.9% in January, after falling by 5% in December. That smashes forecasts of a 3% rise, and is the biggest monthly jump since March 2015. The weekly jobs figures have also been released, and they show a small increase in people filing new unemployment benefit claims. Not a major shock, though, and the total is still low in historic terms: Over in America, one of the country\u2019s top central bank officials isn\u2019t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve President, argued that Brexit isn\u2019t a threat to the US economy, as it would take years for the details to be sorted out. Bullard said (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a risk event for the US because even if British voters decide to quit the EU there will be years for markets and investors to adjust.\u201d Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index just burst back through the 6,000 point mark, as investors welcome today\u2019s GDP figures. The FTSE 100 index, which tracks the leading blue-chip shares in London, has jumped by 2.3% or 137 points to 6,004. That wipes out the losses suffered on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, when traders were fretting about the global economic slowdown. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says the \u2018special dividend\u2019 announced by Lloyds today has improved the mood in the City. Dividend increases are all the rage this morning, as Lloyds, RSA and St James\u2019s Place all opt to flash their cash to keep shareholders happy. A 10% rally in Lloyds, along with a decent bounce for the rest of the sector has seen the FTSE add over 100 points within the first couple of hours of trading. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says Britain\u2019s economy was \u201cwholly dependent on domestic activity\u201d for growth in the last quarter. And without the service sector, there wouldn\u2019t have been any growth at all either, as industrial production fell by 0.5%, and construction contracted by 0.4%. \u201cDomestic demand rose by 0.8% on the previous quarter, with consumer spending and a rise in inventories each accounting for roughly half this increase. Disappointingly, total investment fell slightly, with business investment dropping by 2.1% the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2014. \u201cThe bad news came on the net trade side, which knocked 0.3 percentage points off GDP. At the same time exports were down by 0.1% in the quarter and imports rose by 1.2%. German bank Berenberg reckons that the UK growth rate will slow this year, as the EU referendum approaches. Kallum Pickering, their senior UK economist, explains: Uncertainty hurts confidence and despite strong domestic demand growth toward the end of last year growth is likely to soften in the coming quarters. Economic performance depends on sentiment as much as on fundamentals. The combined effect of heightened global economic worries plus the reality of a possible Brexit - the referendum will take place on 23 June - will likely hit economic performance. As flagged up earlier, some economists think the UK could fall into recession if it votes to leave. He also produced this handy table, showing the details of Britain\u2019s growth over the last 18 months. Some international context: John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, says Britain\u2019s economy performed relatively well last year - encouraging people to move to the UK in search of work. \u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed that the UK economy slowed from 2.9% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015, but remained the second strongest G7 economy last year after the US. \u201cRelatively strong growth in private sector services continues to drive UK growth despite much weaker trends in manufacturing and construction output in the second half of 2015. This has generated a lot of new jobs and helps to explain why net migration to the UK remained at near record levels of 323,000 in the year to September 2015. The UK jobs market remains a powerful magnet for workers from other slower growing countries in the EU and beyond. That 323,000 figure was released this morning - here\u2019s our news story on it: Hawksworth also agrees that consumers are providing the bulk of the growth: \u201cThe expenditure data for the fourth quarter suggest that steady growth in consumer spending remains the mainstay of the UK recovery. Investment growth seems to have stalled in the second half of 2015, however, and imports grew much faster than exports over this period. But these figures are only preliminary at this stage and may well be revised significantly later, so not too much should be read into them.\u201d Britain\u2019s economic recovery is rather less impressive once you adjust for population changes. On a per capita basis, GDP only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. And on that measure, the economy is barely larger than in 2008 - before the financial crisis struck. Give yourselves a round of applause, UK consumers. You\u2019re keeping the economy afloat. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, explains: We had thought that weaker output numbers from industrial and construction sectors through Q4 would have dragged the overall growth number lower but, once again, consumer expenditure has remained resilient. Thank God for the British disposition to buy anything that isn\u2019t nailed down and to at least offer a few quid for the things that are.\u201d \u201cNet trade was also a drag on output although we can but hope that the recent GBP weakness we have seen will allow exporters to gain orders and hedge at currently attractive levels.\u201d Cook also fears that the \u201cbluster and pantomime over the EU referendum\u201d will arm the economy, by hurting business investment and consumer spending. Britain\u2019s trade balance is rarely a pretty sight, as the country sucks in more goods than it sells to the rest of the world. And today\u2019s growth report shows that the deficit has widened again, from \u00a314.7bn in Quarter 3 2015 to \u00a316.6bn in the fourth quarter. The ONS explains that British companies suffered a small drop in exports in the last quarter, while imports continued to climb. Following a 0.5% decrease in Quarter 3 2015, exports decreased by 0.1% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 1.2% in Quarter 4 2015 following a 2.7% rise in Quarter 3 2015. Today\u2019s GDP report also confirms that Britain is heavily reliant on its service companies for growth. The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter, meaning it has expanded steadily for three years. Manufacturing, though, was stagnant after shrinking for the previous three months: Shares are pushing higher, as investors express relief that Britain\u2019s growth rate hasnt\u2019 been revised down. The ONS has also confirmed that Britain grew by 2.2% during 2015. Household spending and business investment provided the bulk of the growth, while the UK trade deficit was a drag. The GDP report also shows that UK firms reined in their spending in the last quarter. The ONS says that business investment shrank by 2.1% in the October-December period, the biggest drop in almost two years. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That confirms the initial estimate of GDP growth from the Office for National Statistics. That means Britain grew faster than Germany (which posted GDP growth of 0.3%), France (+0.2), and the United States (+0.2%). Details to follow... Tension is building in the City as we await the second estimate of UK growth in the last quarter, due in 10 minutes time..... The danger of Britain slumping back into recession will jump sharply if the public vote to leave the EU in June. So claim a group of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who fear that confidence and spending would be knocked by a Brexit victory. Here\u2019s the details: As Britons contemplate their place in the 28-nation bloc before June\u2019s referendum, respondents to a Bloomberg survey said the probability of a slump spikes to 40% in the event of an \u201cout\u201d vote. That compares with just a 13% risk predicted in the most recent monthly poll.... Chris Hare, an economist at Investec Plc, warned: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that we\u2019ll see volatility in financial markets, possibly a tightening in U.K. credit conditions, a hit to business and household confidence and all those things combined should drag on the economy.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit doesn\u2019t believe governments will heed the IMF\u2019s latest call for action: BT shares have jumped by 3% this morning, as the stock market gives its verdict to Ofcom\u2019s review of the communications sector. Although the regulator is forcing BT to open up its network to rivals to build new fibre networks, it has backed away from the nuclear option of breaking up the company. That\u2019s a relief for BT, given the criticism it faces over Britain\u2019s patchy super-fast broadband coverage. My colleague Rob Davies explains: BT has been told to let rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs by regulator Ofcom. In a once-in-a-decade review, the regulator stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to split off Openreach, the division that owns the broadband infrastructure. The verdict will be a blow to rivals including Sky and TalkTalk, which have said BT should lose control of the network. But Ofcom left open the possibility of revisiting that nuclear option if BT does not toe the line on a string of issues. It also gave a series of recommendations, including automatic compensation for customers and businesses when the Openreach network experiences problems. The regulator wants to introduce league tables and make it easier for customers to switch provider. Lloyd\u2019s surging share price has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up by 91 points, or 1.5%, to 5956. RSA, the insurance group, is also helping. Its shares are up 7.6%, after it posted a 43% jump in operating profits. CEO Stephen Hester cheered the City, by reporting that his turnaround plan is largely complete. RSA had also been hit by the winter floods in the North of England - taking a \u00a376m charge to cover insurance claims. Sterling has hit a new 14-month low against the euro this morning, as concern over the EU referendum bubbles away. The pound fell to \u20ac1.2609 against the single currency, which should make UK exports a little more competitive in Europe. Shareholders in Lloyds Banking Group have endured some tough years. Seven tough years, indeed, since the bank had to be bailed out after rescuing HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis. But there\u2019s better news this morning - Lloyds has announced it will pay them a special dividend (a princely 0.5p per share) on top of the full-year dividend of 2.25p. Lloyds only resumed paying dividends last year, and the news of an extra payment has sent shares soaring by almost 10% this morning. Chief executive Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio should also be cheerful - he\u2019s picked up an \u00a38.5m pay deal, even though Lloyds profits dipped last year. China\u2019s stock market has had a bad day. The Shanghai stock market lurched downwards by 6% today, dogged by new anxiety over the Chinese economy. Fears of a possible devaluation also hit confidence, as Martin Farrer explains: Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime. \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit. \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund threw its weight behind calls for fresh action to ward off a global slump. The Fund is worried that the global economy is faltering as financial conditions worsen, emerging markets face tougher times, and the oil industry suffers from cheaper crude prices. In a statement ahead of the G20 finance minister\u2019s meeting in Shanghai, starting tomorrow, the IMF said: These developments point to higher risks of a derailed recovery, at a moment when the global economy is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks\u201d It added that warned governments that they can\u2019t simply rely on central bankers - they need to consider spending more to help their economies. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy.\u201d \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new health-check on the UK economy this morning. At 9.30am, the second estimate of British GDP for the last three months of 2015 is released. It may confirm that the economy grew by 0.5% during the quarter - unspectacular, but better than most major rivals. But some economists reckon it could be revised down to just 0.4%, if nervous businesses have cut their spending. A disappointing number could inflame worries over the UK, in a week where Brexit fears have already sent the pound sliding to seven-year lows. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In a rather strange twist of fate one of the best performing economy\u2019s in Europe over the past 12 months has found its currency take an absolute hammering in the past few weeks as investors take a rather one eyed and alarmist perspective on the potential negative consequences of a British exit from the EU in a referendum vote scheduled for June this year. Later this morning we get the latest iteration of UK Q4 GDP and expectations are for growth of 0.5%, unchanged from the previous reading, and an annualised number of 1.9%, though we could see some evidence that business investment is starting to slow from the previous 2.2% to 0.6%, though the annualised measure is expected to increase to 6.4% from 5.8%. Also coming up today: There\u2019s a flurry of company news hitting the wires, including results from Lloyds Banking Group, theme park group Merlin, and insurance firm RSA. More on all those shortly. And Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, is outlining its plans to create more competition and improve Britain\u2019s broadband network. BT, the former state monopoly, is being ordered to open its network to its rivals, to help them build their own high-speed fibre services. However, BT has also dodged the threat of being broken up - although it\u2019s still an option if things don\u2019t improve. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could these more radical policies be: <br></p> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. </p> <p>A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. </p> <p>There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation.

And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. </p> <p>This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag.</p> <p>However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed.</p> <p>With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0777e4b03786d8023071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T13:55:09.818Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations.</p> <p>It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move.</p> <p>Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. In its economic projections back in December the central bank pencilled in 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. That would be hard to stomach given the market turmoil since the beginning of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0250e4b03786d8023060\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T13:42:22.521Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good news from the US</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sticking with America.... and US factories have just reported a surge in demand for machinery and heavy-duty equipment last month.</strong></p> <p>It suggests the US economy is stronger than some economists feared .</p> <p>Orders for US capital goods jumped by 4.9% in January, after falling by 5% in December. </p> <p>That smashes forecasts of a 3% rise, and is the biggest monthly jump since March 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/702848260667543552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really nice looking durable goods number.</p>&mdash; Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/702848260667543552\">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/702848291520831488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Durable (very) goods</p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/702848291520831488\">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The weekly jobs figures have also been released, and they show a small increase in people filing new unemployment benefit claims. <br></p> <p>Not a major shock, though, and the total is still low in historic terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NourHammoury/status/702848105289539584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*U.S. INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS ROSE 10,000 LAST WEEK TO 272,000</p>&mdash; Nour E.

      "bodyText": "Cash-strapped hospitals are trying to avoid paying taxes and win a \u00a31.5bn rebate in a move that could have a major impact on the finances of local authorities. At least 80 NHS trusts in England have written to local authorities claiming they are eligible for an 80% discount on business rates through a loophole in the tax system. The number of applications represents roughly half of the NHS acute trusts in the country. The discount would be worth an estimated \u00a3250m a year, but the trusts also want it backdated for six years, meaning the government and local authorities, who share business rate revenues, could have to pay \u00a31.5bn. The row highlights the financial pressure on the NHS and the tensions between different parts of the public sector as they battle for funding in the wake of the government\u2019s austerity cuts. Council representatives said the demands from hospitals are \u201cridiculous\u201d and warned they will have to increase council tax to cover shortfalls in their funding. The NHS trusts are claiming they should be classified as charities, meaning they would be eligible for a tax break. Charities enjoy an 80% discount on business rates, which is the equivalent of council tax for non-residential tenants of property. Universities already qualify for relief, as do some private healthcare providers, such as Nuffield Health, which is registered as a charity. However, NHS trusts have previously been considered as public sector-funded organisations rather than charities, partly because they have boards of directors rather than trustees. Bilfinger GVA, a property consultancy, is representing the NHS hospital trusts and says it has legal backing for their claims. Local authorities are seeking legal advice over the issue and are braced for a long battle that could end with a test case in court. Sources close to the situation said that around 100 local authorities have received letters from NHS trusts, which often run more than one hospital. They are demanding a discount for the new financial year and also a rebate covering the previous six years. The Local Government Association (LGA) has estimated that the tax break would cost \u00a3250m a year and paying the rebate would cost \u00a31.5bn. Under existing rules the Department of Communities and Local Government would bear half of the costs and the rest would be spread between local authorities. A spokesman for the LGA said: \u201cThe LGA is supporting member councils who have received applications for mandatory relief from business rates on behalf of a number of NHS trusts and are working with them to consider the appropriate response. \u201cWe have sought legal advice from counsel. We believe that NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts are not charities, and that the applications for rate relief are therefore unfounded.\u201d Each local authority will need to make a decision on the application, but the trusts could seek a judicial review or just stop paying their business-rates bill and wait for the local authority to take action in court. Cambridge city council has warned that the move by hospitals is one of the reasons that it plans to increase council tax by \u00a35 across the board this year. The council has been contacted by three trusts in the area about cutting their tax bill and says the cost of the six-year rebate would be \u00a312m. George Owers, the executive councillor for finance and resources in Cambridge, said: \u201cThere is such a risk hanging over our head that making sure our tax base is maintained is a sound thing to do. It is ridiculous that one part of the public sector is trying to steal money from another part.\u201d Paul Bartlett, a councillor in Ashford, Kent, said the local William Harvey hospital had also made a claim and called for Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to take action. \u201cHe needs to sort this and he needs to tell them to stop,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cThe only people to lose will be the population of Ashford.\u201d However, Bilfinger GVA said the hospitals were entitled to make the claims. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cFollowing a concern raised by an NHS trust client, we have undertaken research into the application of mandatory rate relief, and have sought legal opinion on the issue. \u201cAs a result, we have made applications for relief on behalf of a number of our NHS Trust clients\u200e. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage.\u201d Paul Turner-Mitchell, a business rates campaigner, said he could understand why NHS trusts were trying to cut their tax bill, given that private healthcare providers such as Nuffield Health qualify for the discount. He said: \u201cWhen there is a funding crisis in the NHS, and they pay full business rates as any normal business, you can certainly see why they are trying to position themselves as a charity status. Free healthcare for all of society is far more charitable than corporate screening for executives or plastic surgery for the rich or famous. \u201cMost people will be scratching their heads and wondering why private healthcare companies with corporate screening and gyms are getting significant tax breaks. They are not hard-pressed charities, they are commercially focused organisations.\u201d A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \u201cIt is for local authorities to decide whether any ratepayer meets that eligibility criteria which is set out in legislation.\u201d The Department of Health, NHS England and Monitor, the health service regulator, declined to comment on the matter.",

      "bodyText": "The internet saved the economy. Or at least the British consumers\u2019 obsession with all things internet. Oh, and a property boom that has filled estate agents\u2019 pockets. That\u2019s the only conclusion one can draw from the figures for GDP growth in the final quarter of 2015, which show that galloping services sector output more than made up for the damage done to factory orders by the downturn in global trade and the strictures placed by George Osborne on government spending. Transport, storage and communications, which is a major category in the Office for National Statistics GDP data, has soared in recent times. The communications sector is all about broadband and mobile phones. What do customers like about their broadband \u2013 that it delivers TV and internet. And what do they like about smartphones these days if it isn\u2019t the huge amounts of data bundled with their monthly package. The ONS said computer programming, consultancy and related activities, most of which will be directed towards developing web-based services, increased by 7.6% during the last quarter. Another category \u2013 distribution, hotels and restaurants \u2013 also outstripped the average 0.7% quarterly growth rate for services. The distribution element is powered by the internet as firms increase the already vast sums spent making sure deliveries of food, books and household goods arrive the next day, as demanded by ever more exacting customers. The ONS highlights \u201cwholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, which increased by 10.5%\u201d. Private cars sales have soared in recent years, but it is the servicing of cars and vans used in the growing internet deliveries business that is the real spur in this area. A rise in the category \u201cbusiness services and finance\u201d is mostly fuelled by real estate activities, which increased by 2.7% and not so much the City, which continues to suffer the after-effects of the 2008 banking crash. Reflecting this higher output growth is the increasing share of the labour force employed in services, which has grown from 73% to 80% between 1997 and 2015. One way of characterising this surge in activity is to say we are simply using the new technologies spawned by the internet to run faster for very little gain. That\u2019s not how the economic thinktanks want us to think. They emphasise the need for digital creative industries as manufacturing fades as a major employer. But the extra employment is mostly van drivers and warehouse workers and not so much in the Dundee games industry of the Hoxton app business. The low-skilled workers jetting around to support consumers buying stuff on the internet are also just as likely to be self-employed or agency workers as full-time employed, according to the latest labour market statistics. And while some economists rejoice at the extra employment, whatever shape it takes, a good deal of it comes from the influx of foreign workers, which is adding around 1 million people to the UK\u2019s population every three years based on figures for the past two years. Worse, the policy of simply adding cheap workers to increase the outputs from a particular service is another reason productivity has flatlined since the crash. Yes, the economy is getting bigger, but the concern must be that the proceeds are being distributed among more people and by a digital economy that is seemingly built on cheap labour.",

And what do they like about smartphones these days if it isn\u2019t the huge amounts of data bundled with their monthly package. </p> <p>The ONS said computer programming, consultancy and related activities, most of which will be directed towards developing web-based services, increased by 7.6% during the last quarter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/uk-economic-growth-confirmed-at-05-but-fears-of-slowdown-persist\">UK economic growth confirmed at 0.5% but fears of slowdown persist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another category \u2013 distribution, hotels and restaurants \u2013 also outstripped the average 0.7% quarterly growth rate for services. The distribution element is powered by the internet as firms increase the already vast sums spent making sure deliveries of food, books and household goods arrive the next day, as demanded by ever more exacting customers. </p> <p>The ONS highlights \u201cwholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, which increased by 10.5%\u201d. Private cars sales have soared in recent years, but it is the servicing of cars and vans used in the growing internet deliveries business that is the real spur in this area.</p> <p>A rise in the category \u201cbusiness services and finance\u201d is mostly fuelled by real estate activities, which increased by 2.7% and not so much the City, which continues to suffer the after-effects of the 2008 banking crash.</p> <p>Reflecting this higher output growth is the increasing share of the labour force employed in services, which has grown from 73% to 80% between 1997 and 2015.<br></p> <p>One way of characterising this surge in activity is to say we are simply using the new technologies spawned by the internet to run faster for very little gain. That\u2019s not how the economic thinktanks want us to think. They emphasise the need for digital creative industries as manufacturing fades as a major employer.</p> <p>But the extra employment is mostly van drivers and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">warehouse workers</a> and not so much in the Dundee games industry of the Hoxton app business. The low-skilled workers jetting around to support consumers buying stuff on the internet are also just as likely to be self-employed or agency workers as full-time employed, according to the latest labour market statistics. </p> <p>And while some economists rejoice at the extra employment, whatever shape it takes, a good deal of it comes from the influx of foreign workers, which is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/25/net-migration-to-uk-falls-for-first-time-in-almost-two-years\">adding around 1 million people to the UK\u2019s population every three years</a> based on figures for the past two years. Worse, the policy of simply adding cheap workers to increase the outputs from a particular service is another reason productivity has flatlined since the crash.</p> <p>Yes, the economy is getting bigger, but the concern must be that the proceeds are being distributed among more people and by a digital economy that is seemingly built on cheap labour.</p>",

    "webTitle": "What will Ofcom's review of BT's cable network mean for broadband users?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT is under pressure to open up its network infrastructure to allow rivals to lay their own ultrafast fibre-optic broadband lines, after a review by the telecoms regulator. The move was announced on Thursday as part of Ofcom\u2019s once-in-a-decade review of the telecoms market. Ofcom opted for this course of action after deciding against forcing BT to spin off its Openreach division, which operates the UK\u2019s broadband network infrastructure. But does this mean any change for consumers experiencing trouble with their broadband? What is Openreach? Openreach builds and maintains the UK\u2019s vast copper and fibre network that connect nearly all businesses and homes to the national broadband and telephone network. It has faced criticism over poor service standards. What problems are consumers having? Customers, who include large firms such as TalkTalk and Sky, have suffered a range of problems, from installation delays, to eye-watering costs for laying cables to connect them to the outside world. Competitors say this is down to underinvestment by BT, because it has an effective monopoly. They claim BT\u2019s underinvestment is preventing the roll-out of high-speed \u201cfibre to the premises\u201d internet - from the telephone exchange to individual homes - that could give consumers much faster broadband. What if I don\u2019t use BT? Trouble with Openreach extends beyond BT\u2019s customers because Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone rely on its \u201clast mile\u201d of wiring to get their service to subscribers\u2019 homes. These companies have called for a more radical option from Ofcom, in which BT loses control of Openreach altogether. They argue that Openreach has a poor record on repairs, that it is not investing enough in upgrading its infrastructure and that the cash it generates is helping BT regain a dominant position in the telecoms market. Am I entitled to compensation? Any compensation for delays is paid to the provider. Customers who have lost out must take their case to whichever alternative dispute resolution scheme their provider is signed up to. Ofcom is consulting on payments for affected customers and will set out plans for an automatic compensation scheme this year. This would see customers get a credit on their bill or receive a cheque after a prolonged outage. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that phone and broadband customers who receive poor service should have to pursue their complaint to receive a payment. Instead, they should automatically receive a cheque in the post, or a credit on their bill, when things go wrong.\u201d Does the review mean better broadband? There will be a new government-backed universal obligation to provide fast broadband to every home and business in the UK, starting at 10 megabits per second. If the review helps speed up fibre roll-out, speeds could get as high as 1 gigabit per second across much of the country. Is it worth switching? Ofcom plans to introduce league tables and make it easier for customers to switch provider. This should make it simpler to decide whether it is worth switching, through services such as www.uswitch.com and www.broadbandchoices.co.uk. You can check your speed using a variety of sites. The test takes a few seconds using one of the many online speedometers, which include www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk, or www.speedtest.net.",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy grew by a solid 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015, official figures have confirmed, but news of a surprise drop in business spending fanned fears of a slowdown in the months ahead. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday left estimates for GDP growth unrevised. But fresh details on what was driving the economy underscored the precarious nature of the recovery and raised questions about whether its pace is sustainable. Consumers were again left to do the heavy lifting in the final three months of 2015 as exports struggled, manufacturing stagnated and business investment fell at the sharpest pace for almost two years. \u201cThe data paints a picture of an unbalanced economy that is once again reliant on consumer spending to drive growth, as business shows increased signs of risk aversion,\u201d said Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, which publishes surveys on the state of UK businesses. \u201cGrowth is being supported by firms increasing the wages paid to workers, alongside low inflation, which is clearly good for household incomes in the short term,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut for a sustainable recovery, which involves improvements in productivity and profits, we also need to see business investment revive \u2013 something that will only happen when business confidence lifts higher again.\u201d The ONS said the economy grew 2.2% overall between 2014 and 2015. That figure was also unchanged from an estimate published in January. Growth in UK GDP The 0.5% increase between October and December 2015 followed growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, but marked a slowdown from a rise of 0.6% in the second quarter. Economists have warned that growth could soften because of a tough global economic outlook, as well as domestic factors, notably June\u2019s EU referendum. There are worries that businesses and consumers will cut back on spending before the vote. The ONS figures show that growth in household spending slowed to 0.7% during the fourth quarter from 0.8% in the previous quarter. Business investment fell 2.1%, compared with forecasts for a 0.9% drop in a Reuters poll of economists. Net trade was a drag on growth in the fourth quarter and, confirming previous estimates, the ONS said manufacturing was flat. Those details showed that \u201cgrowth has become even less well-balanced than before\u201d, said Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Tombs added: \u201cThe recovery\u2019s reliance on consumers is worrying, because growth in households\u2019 real incomes looks set to slow this year as the fiscal squeeze intensifies, employment growth fades and inflation revives. \u201cMeanwhile, the chances that investment or exports rebound and offset the consumer slowdown remain slim, given the recent Brexit-related declines in business confidence and the continued uncompetitiveness of UK exports in European markets.\u201d The UK economy has been growing for 12 consecutive quarters after a small dip at the end of 2012. The UK is also among the fastest-growing advanced economies. The eurozone economy increased by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015; within the bloc, Germany\u2019s GDP grew 0.3% and France\u2019s expanded 0.2%, the ONS said. The US economy, the world\u2019s biggest, grew 0.2% in the same period. Reacting to the latest UK figures, a Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThese figures confirm that Britain continued to see steady growth at the end of last year. But following recent downgrades to the global economic outlook, it\u2019s vital that we don\u2019t stop working through our plan that\u2019s building resilience and providing an anchor of stability in uncertain times.\u201d GDP per head slowly recovering Figures on GDP per head, which is seen by some economists as a better reflection of economic wellbeing than overall GDP, show that it rose 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015 and was still only 0.7% above its pre-downturn peak.

      "bodyText": "Warnings by business leaders about the damaging consequences of a vote to leave the EU are overblown and the debate would be improved if bosses stayed out of the fray, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments has said. Nick Varney said anguish over the falling value of the pound as the referendum approached was misplaced and that a lower rate of sterling against the euro was good for the economy. Merlin, which runs Legoland, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, is Europe\u2019s biggest visitor attraction operator. Varney said: \u201cI have a view that the stories of doom and gloom are overblown. We don\u2019t think whether we are in or out makes any difference to us. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the German government would say: \u2018Please don\u2019t employ the thousands of people you employ here.\u2019 I don\u2019t believe the German burgermeisters we are talking to would say: \u2018Don\u2019t invest in our cities\u2019.\u201d The FTSE 100 company\u2019s annual results said potential visitors to its London attractions, including Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, were put off by the strength of the pound against the euro last year. The company has 29 attractions in the UK and 31 in Europe. Varney said sterling\u2019s recent fall against the euro was good news for Merlin and other companies seeking to sell goods and services overseas. He said he could not understand worries about a weaker pound caused by the approaching EU referendum. Asked if he welcomed sterling\u2019s decline, Varney said: \u201cYes, as every British exporter should. I don\u2019t really understand all the hand wringing that goes on when sterling depreciates because history says that when the pound is below \u20ac1.40 it is always better for export industries and job creation.\u201d When the pound was strong against the euro, tourism from Europe tended to drop off and British families were more likely to holiday in Spain and Portugal, he said. Almost 200 business leaders, including bosses of about a third of the FTSE 100 group of leading public companies, signed a letter this week warning that leaving the EU would threaten investment and jobs. Varney said he was asked to sign the letter but declined. \u201cThere are much bigger issues around sovereignty that the debate should legitimately be around,\u201d he said. \u201cI have my personal opinions and I don\u2019t think the fear factor should be driving that debate. I certainly didn\u2019t sign it.\u201d Merlin\u2019s pre-tax profit for the year to the end of December rose by \u00a31m to \u00a3250m. Profit barely grew because of a slump in visitors to Alton Towers, where a rollercoaster crash injured 16 people in June. Five of those were seriously wounded and two women\u2019s legs were amputated. Merlin took full responsibility for the crash and on Thursday the Health and Safety Executive said it would prosecute the company over the incident. Varney said the crash and its effects meant last year was the most difficult in Merlin\u2019s history. \u201cIn a business where what gets you out of bed is the desire to to give people a memorable experience it can\u2019t be anything other than traumatic. We are trying to make sure something like that will never happen again,\u201d he said. Merlin shares rose 4.7% to 455p after Varney announced fresh growth targets, including four new Legolands and 2,000 extra rooms by 2020 \u2013 double the previous goal for additional rooms.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has handed its chief executive an \u00a38.5m pay deal and ignited its share price by announcing a special dividend \u2013 despite reporting a 7% fall in profits. Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio\u2019s pay was disclosed alongside 2015 financial results showing profits had been knocked to \u00a31.6bn by a further \u00a34bn charge for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI). The bank, bailed out in 2008, has now incurred a total bill of \u00a316bn for the long-running scandal which drove it to a fourth-quarter loss. However, its shares jumped 13.5% to close at 70.6p after news of the full-year dividend of 2.25p a share plus a special dividend worth 0.5p per share. This means that the average investor, holding 6,000 shares, will receive \u00a3160. The bank resumed dividends a year ago for the first time since the 2008 crisis and the City had been concerned it would be unable to keep its promises on payouts. Its income rose just 1% during the year, while the bad debt charge was down 48%. The government has been gradually cutting back its stake, from 43% to less than 10%, but despite Thursday\u2019s rally the shares remain below the 73.6p break even price. Chancellor George Osborne is not expected to revive his plan to sell shares to the public - which he abandoned last month blaming market turbulence - until after the EU referendum. Horta-Oso\u0301rio\u2019s \u00a38.5m included an \u00a3800,000 bonus in shares, which he will only receive if the government sells off the rest of its stake or the shares remain above the taxpayer break-even price for 126 consecutive days. He received \u00a311.5m the previous year. The Portuguese banker, who took the helm in 2011 after a career at Santander, is also being handed a 6% rise in salary, taking it to \u00a31.12m, while staff are getting 2%. He said the rise \u2013 part of which he was taking in shares \u2013 should be seen in the context of a 13% rise in salaries since he had taken charge. His total pay was reduced by \u00a3234,000 because of a \u00a3117m fine last year for mishandling compensation claims for PPI. Other senior colleagues also had their bonuses docked for previous years - the deferred awards had not been paid out yet. Horta-Oso\u0301rio said he intended to stay to see through his current plan which runs to the end of 2017. He was also handed shares worth \u00a33.6m in a long-term incentive plan, which could pay out in three years\u2019 time. His 10-strong management team were handed shares worth \u00a317m in the same scheme. The total bonus pool was cut to \u00a3353m from \u00a3369m. Sixty-six staff received total pay of \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000) or more. The bank and its chairman Lord Blackwell, who has expressed anti-EU views, would not be drawn on the consequences of a vote to leave the EU and would not consider the impact on the business until a board meeting on 14 April. Horta-Oso\u0301rio conceded that contingency planning had begun but refused to elaborate. Sandy Chen, an analyst at broker Cenkos, was cautious. \u201cIn the near term, if Brexit uncertainty does translate into housing market uncertainty in terms of house prices and mortgage volumes, Lloyds would have the largest exposure to this.\u201d Horta-Oso\u0301rio was upbeat about the outlook for the UK economy, to which he regards the bank as \u201cinextricably linked\u201d although he said \u201cblack swan\u201d events could always emerge. The results were also hit by a \u00a3837m charge to cover other potential fines and compensation claims, including packaged bank accounts. Some \u00a3720m of the provision was related to products sold through the branch network. Legal warnings showed it continues to co-operate with the Serious Fraud Office over Libor rigging investigations. Horta-Oso\u0301rio is in the midst of a three-year plan that involves cutting 9,000 jobs, and closing 200 branches. The cuts come after 45,000 jobs were lost following the 2008 rescue takeover of HBOS. He has now delayed his targets for returns to shareholders and for cutting costs by a year, blaming low interest rates and the eight percentage point corporation tax surcharge announced by Osborne in his July budget. The bank had previously expected interest rates to rise from 0.5% to 2.5% by 2017 but now does not expect rates to go this high until 2019. Even so, analysts at Haitong said: \u201cThe market should be reassured that the group has the capacity to generate a substantial amount of excess capital for shareholders.\u201d On the eve of the results Sir Victor Blank, who was the bank\u2019s chairman at the time of the HBOS deal, defended the takeover during the 2008 crisis. Blank, who was forced to step down in 2009, was reported by the Financial Times as saying: \u201cThe only people who would argue that they suffered \u2013 and they have \u2013 is shareholders. But if I\u2019m right that the banking system would have collapsed and been nationalised [if we had walked away] then they should be grateful.\u201d",

But with key economic data due, the G20 meeting in China from tomorrow, and another fall in crude as investors worried about Saudi Arabia suggesting there would be no production cuts, the mood remains volatile. And outsourcing group Capita is missing out on the day\u2019s rise, down 49p or 4.5% to \u00a310.23 after mixed full year results. Revenues rose 7% but reported pretax profits fell from \u00a3292.4m to \u00a3112.1m after impairment charges and the costs of exiting lower growth businesses. The company said its total contract value had slipped from \u00a35.1bn last year to \u00a34.7bn. But it raised its margin target range from 12.5%-13.5% to 13%-14%. Analysts at Stifel said: Earnings per share of 70.7p was in line with expectations but there is plenty in today\u2019s prelims for both the bears and bulls to get their teeth into. Starting with the negatives: organic growth of 4.3% in 2015, as forecast, but commentary that for 2016 the target is at least organic revenue growth of 4%. Compare that to December\u2019s trading update when management was confident they could deliver an acceleration in organic growth in 2016. Bid pipeline is down to \u00a34.7bn from \u00a35.1bn in December following the loss of UK Asset Resolution [mortgage servicing unit bid] but the statement highlights a large active prospects lists with a number of opportunities expected to enter the pipeline shortly. A high level of exceptionals related to business exits (\u00a3163m total charge incl. goodwill impairment, provisions and loss on disposal and other non-underlying charges of \u00a3122m (goodwill impairment &amp; provision) related to the life &amp; pension, insurance and asset services divisions. These exceptionals had been flagged at the time of the December trading update but still the size of the charges may take some by surprise today. Turning to the positive: Today\u2019s eye catching announcement is news that the margin guidance range is being increased from 12.5%-13.5% to 13%-14% following business disposals in the year. In a sell note, Michael Donnelly at Panmure Gordon said: The impairment is probably not as large as we had feared, but the risk now is that further impairments in other divisions will further occlude what is already an increasingly incomprehensible set of accounts. Capita\u2019s exit from weaker businesses has clearly driven a marginal improvement in metrics, but falling cash generation and conversion should remain a concern for investors as the portfolio is further rebalanced. But rival Serco has risen 15% to 94p after trading profits of \u00a3138m beat expectations amid signs its turnaround plan after a series of contract problems and scandals could be working. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 105.70 points to 5972.88 as UK economic growth for the fourth quarter came in as expected at 0.5%. Lloyds Banking Group is leading the risers, up 9% at 67.94p following its results and dividend payout, while close behind is RSA Insurance, rising 35.5p to 430p after its figures. Theme park group Merlin Entertainments has risen 4.6% to 454.8p as reported flat profits for 2015, in the wake of the rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers. Panmure Gordon said: This is a seasonally quiet time of the year but trading is in line with expectations and importantly planned investments and developments are on track. We reiterate our buy recommendation and 480p target price. Mining companies have built up some gains, with the exception of Rio Tinto, down 49.5p at 1824.5p after a downgrade from Moody\u2019s. The company\u2019s shares have also gone ex-dividend. Falling for the same reason are easyJet, 37p lower at \u00a314.77, and Diageo, down 12.5p at \u00a318.56.",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese leadership has tried to reassure other governments and the financial markets that they support more transparent decision-making and understand the impact Beijing\u2019s policies can have on the fragile global economy. Shares in China plunged on Thursday afternoon as investors waited nervously on the eve of a two-day summit in Shanghai of G20 finance ministers and central bankers expected to discuss the recent market turmoil and global economic slowdown. Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime. \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit. \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added. The Shanghai meeting is already being compared with the G20 meeting in April 2009 when officials agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression during the global financial crisis. However, few expect this year\u2019s conference to produce similar results. \u201cCalls for co-ordinated policy easing ahead of this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting will almost certainly come to nothing,\u201d wrote Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics in London. China, however, appears to be positioning itself for aggressive fiscal stimulus, hoping it can migrate its economy away from overdependence on low-end export manufacturing to something more sophisticated without setting off a wave of layoffs. Zhu also said that China had room to increase its fiscal deficit this year and would take necessary measures to deal with systemic risks while communicating with the market. According to Bloomberg, he also said that the more fiscal stimulus was needed to kickstart flagging growth in the world economy. \u201cCountries with room to make fiscal expansion should take action,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cWe cannot just rely on monetary policy. Fiscal policy must play a role.\u201d Such increases would have to be approved by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual meeting of parliament which begins March 5, he said. Zhu\u2019s comments followed similar remarks earlier in the day at the same conference by the head of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Jiang Jianqing, who said there was no market basis for further yuan weakness. However, similar calls in the past have had little impact in fending off bearish pressure against the currency, with international investors such as George Soros publicly arguing that the currency is set to decline further. US treasury secretary Jack Lew, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, said China had to make it clear that there was no \u201cmajor devaluation\u201d in the pipeline. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) conducted a surprise one-off devaluation of the official guidance rate in August, which it argued would allow the market to reset at its natural level, but investors have continued to move out of the currency since and the exchange rate has slid further. In a speech at the Shanghai conference, central bank vice governor Yi Gang said that investors could expect more fluctuations by the yuan against the dollar as the PBOC tried to put more emphasis on measuring the yuan\u2019s value against a basket of currencies. The equity markets remained under pressure on Thursday with a fall in the oil price refocusing attention on the weakness of the global economy. The Shanghai Composite index closed down 6.41% while the CSI300 index of leading Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was down 6.14%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong finished down 1.65%. Bourses elsewhere fared better with the Nikkei in Japan up 1.41% and the Kospi in South Korea 0.32% to the good. Brent crude for April delivery skidded 1.1% to $34.04 a barrel and US crude fell 0.9% to $31.86 a barrel after Saudi Arabia dampened expectations of a coordinated production cut to shore up prices. China\u2019s industry ministry said during a separate press conference in Beijing on Thursday that China\u2019s exports and currency remain under pressure, adding the ministry would invest 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) over two years to relocate workers during China\u2019s industrial restructuring. The onshore currency market remained relatively flat in morning trade after the comments, changing hands at around 6.53 per dollar, having softened around 0.6 percent since markets reopened after a week-long holiday earlier in the month. The offshore yuan firmed slightly in morning trade but remained weaker than the onshore rate.",

      "bodyText": "According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, wages last year grew at a slower rate than they have in the 18 years the ABS has been measuring them, and real wages did not rise at all. The figures highlight that the lack of demand in the economy, rather than bracket creep, remains the major economic problem in Australia. Right now, wage growth is perhaps the sharpest indicator of the state of the economy. While employment has shown signs of better than expected growth, the story of the economy in the past few years has been one of low demand. Demand is all about people and businesses wanting things: wanting products or services to buy, and wanting people to work for them in order to make or sell those products and services. When demand is low, everything slackens \u2013 job growth, economic growth, inflation and, crucially, wages. And at the moment it is very low, and so too is wages growth. In the December quarter, wages in the private sector grew by just 0.49% \u2013 the second lowest amount ever \u2013 bested only in the deep dark days of the global financial crisis in September 2009: But add the previous three quarters of very sluggish growth and you have a record low annual wage growth in the private sector of just 2.0% in both trend and seasonally adjusted terms: The ABS has only been calculating the wages price index since 1998, but given the other personal income measure of average weekly earnings is growing slower now than during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, it\u2019s a fairly good bet to say wages have not grown so slowly since the low-inflation days of the early 1960s. And this low wages growth rather diminishes the government\u2019s argument that it must urgently reduce spending in order to pay for income tax cuts to ameliorate the effects of bracket creep. Bracket creep occurs when a natural wage rise (as opposed to a wage rise from a promotion or new job) moves you into a higher tax bracket. It is a problem when wages are rising quickly because the higher tax rate eats into your wage rise \u2013 and is seen by economists as a disincentive to work (although just how much of a disincentive is very debatable). But when wages are growing so slowly, bracket creep is hardly the big issue, in fact, the government probably wishes there was a bit more bracket creep going on. As wages increase, so too does the amount of income tax we pay. Given income tax accounts for around half of all tax revenue, the budget figures are thus very much dependent upon wages growth. If wages grow more slowly than expected, then income tax revenue can also be lower than expected (dependent also upon employment growth). In last year\u2019s May budget, and in the mid-year fiscal and economic outlook released last December, the government estimated wages growth in 2015-16 would be 2.5%. That\u2019s not going to happen. For wages in 2015-16 to grow by 2.5%, they would need to grow in the next six months at a rate equivalent to 2.8% \u2013 something not seen since the middle of 2013, and unlikely to happen now. The low wage growth is also happening across the whole country. While Victoria has the strongest wages growth of 2.4%, the growth remains historically low for that state. But in Western Australia, wages grew by a truly pitiful 1.8%, and in the ACT, they went up by just 1.6%: And going \u201cup\u201d is almost overegging the case. We don\u2019t live in a world where what we earn in wages is unconnected to what we pay for goods and services, so nominal wage growth needs to be seen in the context of the rise in the price of goods and services \u2013 ie inflation. In 2015, the underlying inflation growth rate (which takes out the bumps and falls in some prices to get a more steady figure) was also staggeringly low \u2013 reflecting the lack of demand in the economy. The Reserve Bank\u2019s trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation for 2015 was 2.13% \u2013 just 0.03% points below the trend wages growth for both public sector and private sector workers in 2015 of 2.16%. Thus in 2015, on average, Australian workers\u2019 purchasing power (or real wages) grew by just 0.03% \u2013 basically nothing: Using this measure, real wages growth has been so limp for the past two years that your purchasing power is only 0.14% greater than it was in March 2013 \u2013 so little that in practical terms it is effectively the same. It\u2019s a pretty depressing thought. Also a concern, as noted by senior Westpac economist Justin Smirk, is that the growth in hours worked and wages growth is now very disjointed. Normally, when the number of hours worked is growing strongly \u2013 as it was in 2015 \u2013 wages growth is also strong. That\u2019s not happening at the moment: It means workers are increasing their work, and employers seem to have an increased demand for that work, but it is not flowing through to workers in higher wages. Why that is the case is unclear \u2013 perhaps due to both unions and employers having very low expectations for inflation, perhaps the hours worked data is a bit iffy. But it is pretty strong evidence that the industrial relations system is not loaded in favour of workers, despite what business leaders might suggest. The lower than expected wages growth and the utter lack of real wage growth also suggests the pressing need for government is not bracket creep. Rather it should be looking at how to raise demand such that wages may actually grow in a way that sees bracket creep once again something to worry about.",
