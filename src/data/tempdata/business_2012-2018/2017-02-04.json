      "bodyText": "A turbocharged version of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be heading Britain\u2019s way after Theresa May\u2019s Brexit white paper. That\u2019s the upsetting irony for those (and there were a few) who voted to leave the European Union to escape nasty trade deals that involve secret courts to resolve corporate disputes. These are the courts that some of the world\u2019s biggest companies have used when they want to overturn local laws that jeopardise their profits. Tobacco company Philip Morris was a keen exponent. Its legal suits in Australia, Uruguay and others against plain cigarette packaging caused an outcry and cost the respective governments millions of pounds in legal fees, even though it failed. It is a racing certainty that secret courts will be part of any trade deal with the US because even the Obama administration insisted on them. The infamous Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) schemes are part of virtually every existing trade deal and US corporations remain committed to the need for a legal process hidden from view. Donald Trump\u2019s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, won millions of dollars for ExxonMobil in secret arbitration deals when he was boss of the sprawling energy firm. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already told Congress that he wants to present other countries with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d trade model that includes stronger \u201cenforcement mechanisms\u201d, which very plausibly sounds like a more extreme version of the current secret courts system. Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s chief trade adviser, also looks like he is spoiling for a fight on behalf of corporate America. It was Navarro, an economics professor and close pal of Ross, who hit the headlines last week after he accused Germany, Japan and China of being currency manipulators. In a paper with Ross before the presidential election, he argued strongly for tougher measures on imports to bring down Washington\u2019s ballooning trade deficit. None of this sounds like Britain will get the kind of easy ride promised by international trade minister Liam Fox and his equally naive colleagues Boris Johnson and David Davis. If anything, Fox will be forced to present parliament with a toxic cocktail of arrangements far worse than anything Brussels was prepared to demand. Before the Brexit vote, EU officials reacted to public anger over ISDSs by putting forward a compromise deal. As EU commissioner Frans Timmermans said: \u201cThe new Investment Court System [ICS] will be composed of fully qualified judges, proceedings will be transparent, and cases will be decided on the basis of clear rules.\u201d Timmermans and his colleague, the trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, managed to persuade the Canadians to include this new form of arbitration in the EU/Canada trade deal known as Ceta. But even this will most likely be lost to the UK once it quits the EU. Last week, Fox was due to discuss the impact of Brexit on the Ceta deal. Now Theresa May has decided that Britain is leaving the EU\u2019s single market and customs union on current terms, all the UK\u2019s trade deals via the EU will need to be renegotiated. The hope among Brexiters has always been that the UK can strike a similar or improved compact with the countries covered by existing arrangements. But the Canada deal explicitly recognises that arbitration will be overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The Brexit white paper says the UK will no longer come under the ECJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Once the UK leaves the EU, a new deal is almost certain to revert to the old ISDS system used by Canada, including in the Nafta agreement with Mexico and the US. Fox said there wasn\u2019t enough time to debate the fate of Ceta while the white paper was being discussed. Eagerly, MPs turned to the white paper for an answer. But as Angus Armstrong, a senior director at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research points out, the white paper skirted the issue, even though it is pivotal to how trade disputes are decided in the future. Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to suspect that any UK-US trade deal would involve something equal to, or even worse than, the system of \u2018corporate courts\u2019 or ISDS that proved to be so controversial in TTIP.\u201d Like many, Dearden, who advised voters last year against voting for Brexit to escape TTIP, fears a new deal will pave the way for massive US healthcare companies to mount a takeover of NHS services, and that chemically washed American chickens could supplant homegrown alternatives on supermarket shelves. He has every reason to be concerned. While running Exxon, Tillerson launched investment disputes against a number of countries with which the US has treaties, including Venezuela and Argentina. Reports in the Canadian press show he brought a case against the country under Nafta that secured $17m in compensation for having to pay into a provincial research and development fund where Exxon drills for offshore oil. No doubt Britain will suffer the same democratic deficit once Fox bends the knee in Washington.",

    "webTitle": "War of convenience as supermarket chains take on small stores", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2018I used to know 98% of my customers by name but now it\u2019s more like 40 to 50%, as there\u2019s always new people coming in and shoppers are not so loyal these days,\u201d says Vijay Patel, who has been manning the checkout in his shop on the edge of a London council estate since the early 80s. Patel, 64, can usually be found watching the BBC news from his perch behind the counter. He is a modern-day Arkwright from Open All Hours, spending 70 hours a week making sure the shelves are full and there\u2019s no queue at the till. But over the past 15 years small shopkeepers like Patel, whose family moved to London from Kenya in the 60s, have found themselves in the front line of an escalating convenience-store war, as the big supermarkets moved into what had once been considered a retail backwater. Now the convenience store market is facing renewed scrutiny after Tesco pulled a rabbit out of the hat last month by announcing a \u00a33.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry giant Booker. The surprise move has set hares running among rival retailers and wholesalers in a market where around 80% of the UK\u2019s 41,000-plus convenience stores are still independents or belong to buying groups such as Costcutter or Nisa (known as the \u201csymbol groups\u201d in the industry). Convenience stores are an increasingly important player in the UK food market, ringing up \u00a337.5bn of last year\u2019s \u00a3179bn total grocery sales, according to research by analysts at IGD, the industry trade body. IGD thinks the convenience pie will increase by 11.7% over the next five years to \u00a342bn as Britons turn their backs on the weekly shopping trip in favour of more frequent top-up shops. \u201cWhen we opened the store here in the 80s, the only competition was a small independent round the corner but now there are 11 major shops on my doorstep,\u201d says Patel, reeling off a list of competitors to his Nisa Local store that includes Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose. \u201cThat\u2019s the competition. I have to fight with all 11 of them. How long can you do that?\u201d One of the reasons the proposed Tesco deal is causing so much consternation in the sector is that Booker has 125,000 retailers on its books, including the 5,400-odd stores that are part of Booker\u2019s own symbol networks, taking in the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. Tesco, meanwhile, operates close to 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners, although some analysts also count its 300 Metro high street supermarkets in this group. Tesco already speaks for close to 30% of the UK grocery market, and the controversial deal promises to hand it control of another 2%. Just under half of Booker\u2019s \u00a33.2bn cash-and-carry sales are trade with shopkeepers in its symbol-group networks. Announcing the deal last month, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, and Charles Wilson, his counterpart at Booker, argued the greater buying power of the enlarged business would be a force for good that would \u201cdelight consumers with better availability of quality food at fair prices\u201d. But a decade of aggressive convenience-store opening programmes by the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, coupled with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, means it has been getting harder for small shopkeepers like Patel to survive. \u201cIt was a good living \u2013 but now there is more competition, our profit margins have come down,\u201d says Patel. Today there are 19,000 independents who source their own stock \u2013 often from cash-and-carry outlets owned by Booker \u2013 while another 15,000 are members of a symbol group, like Patel, or a franchise network. \u201cThere used to be a time when the convenience trade was left to independent, family-run stores who would stay open all hours, and customers would accept that they were being charged a few pennies more for the convenience,\u201d says one corporate financier. \u201cBut Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have opened a helluva lot of convenience stores, so shoppers expect the same prices from their corner shop as they pay in big supermarkets. Aldis and Lidls are within walking distance of most people\u2019s homes, so are a kind of convenience store too. That has also pulled down pricing in the sector. \u201cIndependent groups need to think about consolidation,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to allow them to increase their buying power and bring their prices down so they can compete.\u201d In 2012, Costcutter\u2019s attempt to buy Scunthorpe-based Nisa, which has more than 1,000 stores in its network, was rejected. More recently Nisa has been linked to merger talks with cash-and-carry group Bestway. In 2015, Booker bought the Budgens and Londis chains from Musgrave for \u00a340m, bringing nearly 1,800 stores under its wing. Because of its size, the Tesco tie-up with Booker will automatically face the scrutiny of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the regulator expected to open its preliminary fact-finding investigation any day now. Most retail experts believe the CMA will ultimately launch a full-blown inquiry that could delay the marriage for the best part of year. Critics of the deal worry about the potential for Tesco to become the dominant force in convenience retailing in some postcodes, while others point to the \u201csignificant\u201d market share the enlarged business will have in some branded grocery categories. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot of calls from independent retailers and retailers in our network who are concerned by this,\u201d says Darcy Willson-Rymer, who runs symbol group Costcutter, which has more than 2,600 members. \u201cWe support consolidation, but the right sort of consolidation that benefits customers, retailers and suppliers,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think the CMA is best placed to answer whether that\u2019s the case here \u2013 but I would say that, given my position, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Tesco made its first serious foray into what was then the backwater of convenience store retailing when it swooped on West Midlands-based T&amp;S, buying the FTSE 250 company for \u00a3377.3m, in 2002. Tesco\u2019s boss at the time, Sir Terry Leahy, tabled his offer at the end of October and his comments echo those of Lewis today when he promised it was \u201cgreat news for customers\u201d. Things moved quickly and Leahy was able to toast the deal\u2019s success over that year\u2019s Christmas dinner after Patricia Hewitt, then secretary of state for trade and industry at the time, waved it through. A lot has changed in grocery retailing over the past 15 years, not least the arrival of Aldi and Lidl as a major force, but any deal that adds to the might of already-mighty Tesco is expected to be picked over with a fine-tooth comb. One senior industry source said he was certain the deal would face an in-depth inquiry, as the \u201cnoise would be deafening\u201d from Tesco\u2019s rivals unnerved by the tectonic shift in Tesco\u2019s favour. There is also the huge cost of engaging teams of lawyers and economists to do battle with the CMA\u2019s complex market models. \u201cThe CMA will be incredibly detailed,\u201d he says. \u201cAn investigation is very costly and a major distraction for senior management. There\u2019s unintended consequences [with] these things because you are unable to make decisions \u2013 because you\u2019re not sure of what is going to happen.\u201d The industry veteran harbours his own doubts about the deal, which he fears could lessen competition at store level while at the same time putting pressure on suppliers. \u201cCharles Wilson is clever and Dave Lewis is no slouch either, and I can see why they think it would work, but from a market perspective, if you ask \u2018Is it in the interest of consumers?\u2019 \u2013 probably not. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is helpful to competition if you give too much volume and authority to a dominant grocery retailer, as they are. This is not a done deal.\u201d WHAT WILL THE TESCO-BOOKER MERGER MEAN? Tesco\u2019s merger with Booker is raising both concerns and hopes among suppliers, depending on their size and what they produce. Farmers and small-scale food processors or manufacturers are nervous as they could be squeezed by the already massive Tesco gaining more power. Analysts estimate Booker will add about \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn to Tesco\u2019s current \u00a345bn of buying power. Meanwhile, Tesco says it will save \u00a3175m a year in costs \u2013 \u00a396m from improved procurement. \u201cConsolidation at the downstream [retail] end of the food supply chain spells only one thing, and that\u2019s continued supply-chain consolidation upstream as well,\u201d says Duncan Swift, head of the food advisory group at accountants Moore Stephens. And he says the savings Tesco has talked about can mean only one thing for its suppliers \u2013 reduced profit margins. Ged Futter of GSCOP, which advises suppliers on their dealings with supermarkets, says: \u201cIt is always concerning when a dominant player gets more power.\u201d He says many food suppliers currently benefit from a higher margins on the goods they supply to food-service customers (catering outlets) or wholesalers (like cash-and-carry outlets), which they can balance out against tight profits on supplying supermarkets. If Tesco seeks to level the margins across all areas of the merged business it could be very bad news for suppliers. One senior insider agrees: \u201cI imagine the independent out-of-home and convenience retail sector is where Tesco thinks it can deliver the biggest gains from enhanced buying power.\u201d Big international brand owners, such as Unilever, P&amp;G and Birds Eye, are thought to be likely losers from the tie-up as this is where the combined Tesco-Booker will gain more market share. Tesco has already had a very public spat with Unilever after the Marmite-to-Hellmann\u2019s group tried to raise priceswith all retailers in response to the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound. The supermarket won a better deal than many of its rivals; now it will have even more weight. But analysts reckon suppliers of own-label products to the supermarkets will be quite comfortable with the deal. Damian McNeela at HSBC says: \u201cIt may mean incremental volumes for them as most aren\u2019t supplying Booker at the moment.\u201d He adds that limited spare capacity among own-label suppliers in some areas, such as ready meals, make it difficult for Tesco to make a big switch to pastures new. Another positive is that a Tesco-Booker deal is likely to increase the prospect of the Groceries Supply Code of Practice being extended; it is currently limited to retailers with turnover above \u00a31bn. The National Farmers Union and others have called for wholesalers and food processors to come under the auspices of the Groceries Code Adjudicator, Christine Tacon, who has helped improve suppliers\u2019 treatment. Ruth Mason, the NFU\u2019s chief food chain adviser, says: \u201cTesco\u2019s relationship with suppliers and Booker\u2019s should be subject to the same legal requirements.\u201d Futter says such a move could bring thousands more food producers under the protective eye of the GCA, giving them better awareness of their rights and back-up in enforcing them. Mason adds that Tesco buys a greater proportion of its produce in the UK and extending that into Booker could be good news for farmers. But she says it is too early to tell: \u201cIt depends if it uses that [new] power for good \u2013 or to make massive commercial gains by putting pressure on the supply chain.\u201d Sarah Butler",

IGD thinks the convenience pie will increase by 11.7% over the next five years to \u00a342bn as Britons turn their backs on the weekly shopping trip in favour of more frequent top-up shops.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we opened the store here in the 80s, the only competition was a small independent round the corner but now there are 11 major shops on my doorstep,\u201d says Patel, reeling off a list of competitors to his Nisa Local store that includes Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose. \u201cThat\u2019s the competition. I have to fight with all 11 of them. How long can you do that?\u201d</p> <p>One of the reasons the proposed Tesco deal is causing so much consternation in the sector is that Booker has 125,000 retailers on its books, including the 5,400-odd stores that are part of Booker\u2019s own symbol networks, taking in the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. Tesco, meanwhile, operates close to 2,500 convenience stores under its Express and One Stop banners, although some analysts also count its 300 Metro high street supermarkets in this group.</p> <p>Tesco already speaks for close to 30% of the UK grocery market, and the controversial deal promises to hand it control of another 2%.</p> <p>Just under half of Booker\u2019s \u00a33.2bn cash-and-carry sales are trade with shopkeepers in its symbol-group networks. Announcing the deal last month, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, and Charles Wilson, his counterpart at Booker, argued the greater buying power of the enlarged business would be a force for good that would \u201cdelight consumers with better availability of quality food at fair prices\u201d.</p> <p>But a decade of aggressive convenience-store opening programmes by the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, coupled with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, means it has been getting harder for small shopkeepers like Patel to survive.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a good living \u2013 but now there is more competition, our profit margins have come down,\u201d says Patel. Today there are 19,000 independents who source their own stock \u2013 often from cash-and-carry outlets owned by Booker \u2013 while another 15,000 are members of a symbol group, like Patel, or a franchise network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb9b63ff1d38d4a60af5e0c79ae0839f677211c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb9b63ff1d38d4a60af5e0c79ae0839f677211c/0_64_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vijay Patel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vijay Patel in his Nisa Local store.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere used to be a time when the convenience trade was left to independent, family-run stores who would stay open all hours, and customers would accept that they were being charged a few pennies more for the convenience,\u201d says one corporate financier. \u201cBut Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have opened a helluva lot of convenience stores, so shoppers expect the same prices from their corner shop as they pay in big supermarkets. Aldis and Lidls are within walking distance of most people\u2019s homes, so are a kind of convenience store too. That has also pulled down pricing in the sector.</p> <p>\u201cIndependent groups need to think about consolidation,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to allow them to increase their buying power and bring their prices down so they can compete.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Costcutter\u2019s attempt to buy Scunthorpe-based Nisa, which has more than 1,000 stores in its network, was rejected. More recently Nisa has been linked to merger talks with cash-and-carry group Bestway. In 2015, Booker bought the Budgens and Londis chains from Musgrave for \u00a340m, bringing nearly 1,800 stores under its wing.</p> <p>Because of its size, the Tesco tie-up with Booker will automatically face the scrutiny of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the regulator expected to open its preliminary fact-finding investigation any day now. Most retail experts believe the CMA will ultimately launch a full-blown inquiry that could delay the marriage for the best part of year. Critics of the deal worry about the potential for Tesco to become the dominant force in convenience retailing in some postcodes, while others point to the \u201csignificant\u201d market share the enlarged business will have in some branded grocery categories.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot of calls from independent retailers and retailers in our network who are concerned by this,\u201d says Darcy Willson-Rymer, who runs symbol group Costcutter, which has more than 2,600 members. \u201cWe support consolidation, but the right sort of consolidation that benefits customers, retailers and suppliers,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think the CMA is best placed to answer whether that\u2019s the case here \u2013 but I would say that, given my position, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>Tesco made its first serious foray into what was then the backwater of convenience store retailing when it swooped on West Midlands-based T&amp;S, buying the FTSE 250 company for \u00a3377.3m, in 2002. Tesco\u2019s boss at the time, Sir Terry Leahy, tabled his offer at the end of October and his comments echo those of Lewis today when he promised it was \u201cgreat news for customers\u201d. Things moved quickly and Leahy was able to toast the deal\u2019s success over that year\u2019s Christmas dinner after Patricia Hewitt, then secretary of state for trade and industry at the time, waved it through.</p> <p>A lot has changed in grocery retailing over the past 15 years, not least the arrival of Aldi and Lidl as a major force, but any deal that adds to the might of already-mighty Tesco is expected to be picked over with a fine-tooth comb.</p> <p>One senior industry source said he was certain the deal would face an in-depth inquiry, as the \u201cnoise would be deafening\u201d from Tesco\u2019s rivals unnerved by the tectonic shift in Tesco\u2019s favour. There is also the huge cost of engaging teams of lawyers and economists to do battle with the CMA\u2019s complex market models.</p> <p>\u201cThe CMA will be incredibly detailed,\u201d he says. \u201cAn investigation is very costly and a major distraction for senior management. There\u2019s unintended consequences [with] these things because you are unable to make decisions \u2013 because you\u2019re not sure of what is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The industry veteran harbours his own doubts about the deal, which he fears could lessen competition at store level while at the same time putting pressure on suppliers.</p> <p>\u201cCharles Wilson is clever and Dave Lewis is no slouch either, and I can see why they think it would work, but from a market perspective, if you ask \u2018Is it in the interest of consumers?\u2019 \u2013 probably not.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is helpful to competition if you give too much volume and authority to a dominant grocery retailer, as they are. This is not a done deal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94beddcbdcb759232bc8362a5bc73b5dde2a846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94beddcbdcb759232bc8362a5bc73b5dde2a846/0_75_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Booker cash-and-carry in south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Booker cash-and-carry in south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>WHAT WILL THE TESCO-BOOKER MERGER MEAN?</h2> <p>Tesco\u2019s merger with Booker is raising both concerns and hopes among suppliers, depending on their size and what they produce. Farmers and small-scale food processors or manufacturers are nervous as they could be squeezed by the already massive Tesco gaining more power.</p> <p>Analysts estimate Booker will add about \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn to Tesco\u2019s current \u00a345bn of buying power. Meanwhile, Tesco says it will save \u00a3175m a year in costs \u2013 \u00a396m from improved procurement.</p> <p>\u201cConsolidation at the downstream [retail] end of the food supply chain spells only one thing, and that\u2019s continued supply-chain consolidation upstream as well,\u201d says Duncan Swift, head of the food advisory group at accountants Moore Stephens. And he says the savings Tesco has talked about can mean only one thing for its suppliers \u2013 reduced profit margins.</p> <p>Ged Futter of GSCOP, which advises suppliers on their dealings with supermarkets, says: \u201cIt is always concerning when a dominant player gets more power.\u201d He says many food suppliers currently benefit from a higher margins on the goods they supply to food-service customers (catering outlets) or wholesalers (like cash-and-carry outlets), which they can balance out against tight profits on supplying supermarkets. If Tesco seeks to level the margins across all areas of the merged business it could be very bad news for suppliers.</p> <p>One senior insider agrees: \u201cI imagine the independent out-of-home and convenience retail sector is where Tesco thinks it can deliver the biggest gains from enhanced buying power.\u201d</p> <p>Big international brand owners, such as Unilever, P&amp;G and Birds Eye, are thought to be likely losers from the tie-up as this is where the combined Tesco-Booker will gain more market share.</p> <p>Tesco has already had a very public spat with Unilever after the Marmite-to-Hellmann\u2019s group tried to raise priceswith all retailers in response to the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound. The supermarket won a better deal than many of its rivals; now it will have even more weight.</p> <p>But analysts reckon suppliers of own-label products to the supermarkets will be quite comfortable with the deal.</p> <p>Damian McNeela at HSBC says: \u201cIt may mean incremental volumes for them as most aren\u2019t supplying Booker at the moment.\u201d He adds that limited spare capacity among own-label suppliers in some areas, such as ready meals, make it difficult for Tesco to make a big switch to pastures new.</p> <p>Another positive is that a Tesco-Booker deal is likely to increase the prospect of the Groceries Supply Code of Practice being extended; it is currently limited to retailers with turnover above \u00a31bn. The National Farmers Union and others have called for wholesalers and food processors to come under the auspices of the Groceries Code Adjudicator, Christine Tacon, who has helped improve suppliers\u2019 treatment.</p> <p>Ruth Mason, the NFU\u2019s chief food chain adviser, says: \u201cTesco\u2019s relationship with suppliers and Booker\u2019s should be subject to the same legal requirements.\u201d</p> <p>Futter says such a move could bring thousands more food producers under the protective eye of the GCA, giving them better awareness of their rights and back-up in enforcing them.</p> <p>Mason adds that Tesco buys a greater proportion of its produce in the UK and extending that into Booker could be good news for farmers. But she says it is too early to tell: \u201cIt depends if it uses that [new] power for good \u2013 or to make massive commercial gains by putting pressure on the supply chain.\u201d<br><strong>Sarah Butler</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "High up in the 19th-century edifice that forms the front of the Gare du Nord in Paris, Eurostar has found a new, grand perch. The cross-Channel train service has a startling upgrade in store for its business travellers, the latest gambit to bolster a company that is right in the frontline of Brexit. Last week it unveiled a lounge designed to feel more like an elegant Parisian flat, all high ceilings and marble fireplaces, sofas and wide tables. A kitchen stocked with a buffet curated by the Anglo-French chef Raymond Blanc is also promised later this year. Beyond lies a cocktail room, whose centrepiece is a sunken circular bar. It will serve an Ang\u00e9lique, which, Blanc advises, is the only drink that actually wards off a crise de foie and aids digestion. And of course there are plenty of places to work, if you get that far. Investment at Eurostar is pressing ahead, even if the rail operator could be forgiven for feeling uneasy about running trains on the one fixed link between Britain and Europe. The referendum came in an already difficult year for Eurostar, with bookings dropping away after terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. Strikes in the summer and the axing of 80 jobs followed: the company said that June\u2019s vote had created uncertainty, and its ticket sales dipped again. What chance, then, with actual Brexit?

Eurostar, 55% owned by the French national rail operator SNCF, says it benefited greatly from the EU establishing common standards for aspects of its business, from train operation to employment. Possible headaches lie ahead in recruiting and retaining its diverse, international staff. Analysts are uncertain about the effects of Brexit. Gerald Khoo, of stockbroker Liberum Capital, says there could be upsides and downsides: \u201cFewer MEPs and civil servants going to Brussels \u2013 but if UK companies really do pivot towards Paris, that could also be a boost.\u201d A weak pound cuts both ways for a cross-border business, but Eurostar\u2019s leisure travellers are still mostly Brits, who will need to shell out more. Indeed, concerns exist in the minds of travellers. One Eurostar passenger, a UK-based French designer called Hiba, travels regularly between London and Paris for work and to see family, but says she is thinking of moving back to France. \u201cIt\u2019s been fine, but now there are these silly questions, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all going to be complicated.\u201d Etienne Koehler, a frequent traveller who works for Banque de France, has already relocated back to Paris after 10 years in London. \u201cBetter get ahead of the mood, I thought \u2013 there is already less opportunity in the UK.\u201d He thinks \u201cwithout doubt\u201d there will be fewer travellers between the cities in future, although he\u2019s enamoured of the new lounge. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to be chouchout\u00e9 [pampered].\u201d Jonathan Warburton, a London-based banker for a French bank, who takes the Eurostar every other week, thinks Brexit won\u2019t affect his travel unduly. \u201cThe bank might shift about 5% of its staff over, but London\u2019s the hub, and where the talent is.\u201d News of a new Paris lounge is a bonus, he says: the old one has been \u201ca bit of a bunfight \u2013 these strange swivel chairs facing each other\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The government has threatened a fresh crackdown on energy providers after npower hiked prices for more than a million customers by 9.8% \u2013 adding \u00a3109 a year to bills. A spokesman for the prime minister said ministers would intervene if the energy market was shown to be failing. \u201cObviously, we are concerned by npower\u2019s planned increases. The government is committed to getting the best deal for households,\u201d he said. \u201cSuppliers are protected from the recent fluctuations in the wholesale energy prices in which they are buying up to two years in advance. So we expect energy companies to treat their customers fairly, and are being clear that where markets aren\u2019t working we are prepared to act.\u201d Npower, one of the big six energy providers, said the rise in dual fuel bills would affect about half of its customers, or 1.4m households. From 16 March, it will raise electricity prices by an average of 15% and gas prices by 4.8%. Other big six providers are expected to follow with increases. With average household bills for npower\u2019s dual fuel customers expected to increase from \u00a31,077 to \u00a31,187 a year, Claire Osborne, energy expert at the price comparison website uSwitch, said: \u201cThis price rise \u2013 the largest single rise from a big six supplier since 2013 \u2013 is a bitter blow for consumers who have just come out of a very chilly winter. \u201cNpower has blamed the rise on the increased cost of buying energy in global markets \u2013 but they weren\u2019t so quick to reduce energy bills when wholesale prices were low.\u201d The average dual fuel bill in the UK is \u00a31,066. The move comes a fortnight after the industry regulator, Ofgem, warned the big six against raising prices, saying it was \u201cnot obvious\u201d that tariffs should go up despite rising wholesale prices. But energy companies have so far escaped a severe regulatory crackdown. Concluding an inquiry into the sector last year, the competition watchdog declined to cap bills and instead opted to help customers switch to cheaper deals. Npower blamed its planned rises on increases in wholesale gas and electricity costs and the cost of delivering government policies, such as smart metering and subsidies for renewable energy. It said wholesale electricity prices had risen 38% over the last 12 months, while gas prices had risen 60%. Simon Stacey, the company\u2019s managing director of domestic markets, said: \u201cThis is a hugely difficult decision, and we have delayed the date this takes effect until after the coldest months of the year. We have also made sure that our most vulnerable customers won\u2019t see any impact until May.\u201d Consumer groups said the move would put further pressure on household finances and urged energy customers to shop around to get a cheaper deal. Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of the comparison site money.co.uk, said the price hikes were unfair. \u201cThis is a slap in the face for many already struggling families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that we all need to be tightening our purse strings to cope with price rises and looking where we can make savings.\u201d German-owned npower is the second of the big six suppliers to announce price rises. EDF Energy said in December its standard dual fuel direct debit price would increase by 1.2% to \u00a31,082 a year. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the remaining four of the big six \u2013 British Gas, E.ON, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 were likely to follow and urged consumers to take matters into their own hands by demanding a cheaper deal. \u201cAlmost certainly by the end of April we will have seen all the big six firms having hoicked their prices by between 5% and 10%,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not groan, moan or whinge. Take action. Everybody, with every firm, should make sure they\u2019re on the very cheapest tariff. The best thing to do is a whole-of-market comparison, but even if you\u2019re not willing to do that, call up your existing company and say: \u2018Am I on your cheapest deal?\u2019 Most people aren\u2019t, and hundreds can be saved just by one phone call.\u201d The government is expected to address concerns about the energy market when it publishes a consumer green paper in the spring. Iain Wright, the Labour MP who chairs the House of Commons\u2019 business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said the price hikes showed that npower took its loyal customers for granted. \u201cThis is one of the biggest price increases from a big six energy company, a company which regularly comes bottom of tables for customer service. \u201cIt comes just days after npower admitted to the BEIS committee that their business model involves standard tariff customers who have been with the company for a long time subsiding new customers enticed by cheap deals. \u201cCustomers who stay loyal to an energy company, often on the most expensive tariff, should be rewarded with a discount in their bills, not penalised with a massive price hike.\u201d A two-year investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority concluded last June that 70% of domestic customers of the big six were on expensive standard variable tariffs and could save more than \u00a3300 by switching to a cheaper deal. As a result, customers have been paying \u00a31.4bn a year more than they would in a fully competitive market, the CMA found.",
