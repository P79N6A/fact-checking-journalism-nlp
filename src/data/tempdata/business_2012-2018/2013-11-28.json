      "bodyText": "Sales of fence panels and water pumps in the wake of the Saint Jude storm helped performance at B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, which revealed a 4.6% rise in sales in the quarter to 2 November. Fence panel sales rose 41% while water pumps rose 63% in the week after high winds hit Britain last month, helping to maintain growth in underlying sales at B&amp;Q despite the ongoing squeeze on disposable incomes. But shares in Kingfisher slid 4.4% to 378.5p as profits came in at the low end of City expectations at \u00a3271m \u2013 a rise of 5.8% \u2013 while chief executive Ian Cheshire warned of tough trading conditions in France, Kingfisher's most profitable territory. \"Consumer confidence is still weak and with no obvious signs of an imminent improvement,\" he said. Underlying sales in France were flat and profits down 5.6% once currency fluctuations were accounted for, amid heavy discounting among DIY retailers as the country's housing market continued to contract. Analysts were concerned that B&amp;Q's underlying sales were virtually flat, at 0.4%, as sales of DIY products continued to suffer despite signs of a pick-up in the UK housing market. Cheshire said DIY was suffering because shoppers still had little spare cash as inflation continued to outstrip wage rises. He said sales to tradesmen were performing better because \"white van man\" was benefiting from a boom in construction thanks to the Help to Buy scheme. But he said DIY sales were more reliant on a strong market for older houses, and that had yet to see real growth.

    "webTitle": "Hedge fund sells up after forcing Co-op to cede control of bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the US hedge funds which forced the Co-operative Group to cede control of its troubled bank has sold its investment ahead of a crucial vote on a rescue \u00a31.5bn fundraising. Just hours after the Co-operative Bank admitted it was losing current accounts because of concerns over its future as an ethical institution amid the intervention of hedge funds and the scandal over former chairman Paul Flowers, it emerged that the US hedge fund Aurelius had sold its position in the bank's bonds. Aurelius \u2013 best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts \u2013 had bought up Co-op bonds as they collapsed in value following the downgrade of the bank to junk status in May. Since then the bonds have risen in value and have now been sold on to another hedge fund, London-based Perry Capital. Perry pledged to continue backing the crucial restructuring of the bank just hours before Friday's deadline to vote on the deal. The so-called LT2 group of hedge funds, which included Aurelius and has forced the changes on the Co-op Group, made no reference to the crucial change in its membership when it reiterated its support for the restructuring on Thursday morning. If bondholders vote to back the restructuring of the bank, the wider Co-op Group, which includes supermarkets and funeral homes, will end up with just a 30% stake in the bank that bears its name. The deadline for votes is 4.30pm on Friday. The Co-op, in an unscheduled announcement outlining technical changes to the terms offered to LT2, insisted that its savers \u2013 whom it relies on to finance its business \u2013 were not moving their cash out of the bank and its deposit base remained stable. Flowers is on bail until January after being arrested following a Mail on Sunday report that showed a video of the 63-year-old Methodist minister handing over cash to apparently buy drugs. Even before Flowers' arrest there was concern that the intervention of hedge funds in the Co-op fundraising could make it difficult for the bank to maintain its ethical stance. \"These recent events, together with the competitive landscape in which the bank operates, the introduction of seven-day account switching and the associated increased competitor marketing activity at a time when the bank has been constrained in its ability to undertake its own marketing activity, may be a contributing factor to an increase the bank has seen in the switching out of current accounts,\" Co-op said. The wording is tougher than that in the prospectus sent to bondholders on 4 November to back the restructuring when it referred to a \"material reduction\" in the number of people moving their accounts to the bank since the seven-day switching service was introduced in September. At that time it said corporate customers had taken away \u00a31.4bn worth of deposits since the ratings downgrade in May. The admission by the Co-op bank came as its regulator, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said the regulatory approval granted to enable Flowers to become chairman in 2010 was \"before his time\". Bailey, who took over the top regulation job in the summer of 2011, said he had required the Co-op bank board to be strengthened and had set out hurdles for the bank to meet if it was to be granted approval for the takeover of 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. That deal, called Verde, collapsed this year. Bailey insisted he did not \"know the whole story\" about what had happened or about any potential intervention from politicians keen to see the Co-op take over the Lloyds' branches. He added: \"The real important thing today is not to deal with Reverend Flowers's antics but to deal with stabilisation and restructuring of the bank.\" Lord Myners, City minister during the 2008 banking crisis, called for institutional investors to be represented when bank directors are appointed. \"We need a fundamental change in accountability and alignment within the board room. Shareholders had got off scot-free when it came to culpability for bank failures and the cost to the economy,\" Myners said. Lloyds looks to lord The Conservative peer Lord Blackwell is the leading candidate to become the next chairman of the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group. The former head of Sir John Major's policy unit, and a serial non-executive director, already has a seat on the bank's board and chairs its insurance arm Scottish Widows. He previously sat on the board of Standard Life and retailers Dixons and was once a partner at the management consultants McKinsey. The bank, whose chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, received a \u00a32.3m bonus last week because of the rally in its shares, has been seeking a successor to Sir Win Bischoff who wants to retire at next year's annual meeting. The government began to sell its stake in Lloyds in September and now owns a 32% shareholding, which is expected to fall further before the general election through a sell-off to retail investors. Lloyds would not comment on its next chairman on Thursday.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England steps in amid fears of a new house price bubble", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England on Thursday reined in the mortgage market as he sought to prevent five years of ultra-low interest rates and George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme from fuelling a pre-election housing bubble. Amid concerns that the UK is in the early stages of a new property boom, Mark Carney announced he was refocusing the Funding for Lending (FLS) scheme that gave lenders financial incentives to provide home loans. The governor said it was \"no longer appropriate or necessary for us to have our foot on the accelerator, better to shift into neutral\". He said it was time to focus FLS on small businesses. The decision had been taken with the chancellor, he said. \"By acting now in a graduated fashion, authorities are reducing the likelihood that larger interventions will be needed later,\" Carney said. The governor stressed that the housing market is not an immediate risk to financial stability. But he admitted that financial policymakers were concerned about the \"prospective evolution\" of the market amid forecasts of a 10% rise in house prices next year on top of a near-7% increase in the past 12 months. The TUC said the move would \"hit the feelgood factor\" Osborne has been trying to create before the 2015 general election and prompted speculation that the move to end a key part of the FLS had been taken reluctantly by the chancellor. Osborne said: \"Now the housing market is starting to pick up, it is right we focus the scheme's firepower on small businesses. Small firms are the lifeblood of our economy.\" Some economists were sceptical that the withdrawal of the FLS would have a major impact. Others warned it could spell the end of the low mortgage rates that customers have enjoyed and that are said to be helping to propel house prices higher. More than \u00a31bn was wiped off the value of housebuilders after Carney's remarks \u2013 Barratt Developments fell almost 10% and Persimmon 6% \u2013 on fears that ending FLS might backfire. Sterling rose on expectations of interest-rate rises, although economist James Knightly at City bank ING said the aim of the policymakers was to have the opposite effect. The FLS provided an immediate boost to mortgage lending when it launched in August 2012 and has since been supplemented by the chancellor's Help to Buy scheme, which offers subsidised home loans up to \u00a3600,000. Help to Buy will be unaffected by the package of measures announced by the Bank of England on Thursday. Other changes designed to keep a close watch on the housing market include imposing tougher \"affordability\" tests on consumers before they are granted home loans and ensuring that annual financial health checks on banks include the impact of major shocks in the housing market. The surprise move to refocus FLS means that until the scheme ends, in January 2015, it will now be used only for business loans. The FLS for home loans will end a year earlier than planned, in January 2014. Cathy Jamieson, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"We called for the (FLS) to prioritise lending to business, and, after three wasted years when net lending to firms has fallen, the government is belatedly acting. But homeowners facing a cost-of-living crisis will want reassurance from ministers that suddenly taking the scheme away from mortgage lending won't see a rise in mortgage rates.\" Business secretary Vince Cable said the changes to FLS were \"sensible and welcome\", adding: \"It is critical it supports growth in the productive economy, rather than simply stoke the housing market.\" In a letter to Osborne, Carney said: \"Although the growth in household loan volumes remains modest, activity is picking up and house price momentum appears to be gaining momentum.\" But there were no changes to the Help to Buy scheme, which the Bank will assess annually from 2014. In Thursday's half-yearly check on the risks to financial stability, the Bank said activity in the housing market remains below long-term trends. The Bank's financial stability review spelled out the impact that rate rises could have on the most vulnerable households, who have taken on mortgages at high multiples of their incomes and over periods of more than 25 years. The Bank of England said it was putting \"several actions in train that will guard against a build-up in vulnerabilities\". New mortgage affordability tests will be introduced from April 2014. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"This is good news for the real economy, but bad news for the chancellor. The Bank of England is clearly worried that the economic recovery is based on consumers borrowing on the back of rising house prices rather than business investment and rising exports. \"Ensuring that Funding for Lending works to boost business investment is a sensible policy that can drive sustainable growth and help build a new economy. But stopping over-excitement in the property market may hit the feelgood factor that the chancellor is hoping will distract from the failure of government policy to rebalance the economy.\" The Bank said a key risk to financial stability could be caused by an abrupt rise in long-term interest rates, and the Financial Conduct Authority is working with banks and other firms to ensure they are prepared for this risk. Public sector indebtedness has also risen since the crisis and some households remain vulnerable. \"Financial stability risks remain, including from the high indebtedness of some sovereigns, corporates and households. These vulnerabilities have been kept in check by low interest rates and other policy interventions,\" the financial stability report said.",

He said it was time to focus FLS on small businesses. The decision had been taken with the chancellor, he said.</p> <p>\"By acting now in a graduated fashion, authorities are reducing the likelihood that larger interventions will be needed later,\" Carney said. The governor stressed that the housing market is not an immediate risk to financial stability. But he admitted that financial policymakers were concerned about the \"prospective evolution\" of the market amid forecasts of a 10% rise in house prices next year on top of a near-7% increase in the past 12 months.</p> <p>The TUC said the move would \"hit the feelgood factor\" Osborne has been trying to create before the 2015 general election and prompted speculation that the move to end a key part of the FLS had been taken reluctantly by the chancellor. Osborne said: \"Now the housing market is starting to pick up, it is right we focus the scheme's firepower on small businesses. Small firms are the lifeblood of our economy.\"</p> <p>Some economists were sceptical that the withdrawal of the FLS would have a major impact. Others warned it could spell the end of the low mortgage rates that customers have enjoyed and that are said to be helping to propel house prices higher.</p> <p>More than \u00a31bn was wiped off the value of housebuilders after Carney's remarks \u2013 Barratt Developments fell almost 10% and Persimmon 6% \u2013 on fears that ending FLS might backfire. Sterling rose on expectations of interest-rate rises, although economist James Knightly at City bank ING said the aim of the policymakers was to have the opposite effect.</p> <p>The FLS provided an immediate boost to mortgage lending when it launched in August 2012 and has since been supplemented by the chancellor's Help to Buy scheme, which offers subsidised home loans up to \u00a3600,000.</p> <p>Help to Buy will be unaffected by the package of measures announced by the Bank of England on Thursday. Other changes designed to keep a close watch on the housing market include imposing tougher \"affordability\" tests on consumers before they are granted home loans and ensuring that annual financial health checks on banks include the impact of major shocks in the housing market.</p> <p>The surprise move to refocus FLS means that until the scheme ends, in January 2015, it will now be used only for business loans.

      "bodyText": "The Christmas shopping season will kick off in earnest as British retailers bid to kickstart spending by adopting the American tradition of \"Black Friday\" discounting. The first weekend in December is always a high spending period as the nation collects its last pay packet before Christmas Day. Online retailers are used to seeing a surge in sales on \"Cyber Sunday\" and \"Mega Monday\" as shoppers try to ensure they get the presents they want delivered in time for the big day. But now the US tradition of Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when shops slash prices to encourage sales, is gathering pace in the UK. It is being driven by US retailers with a foot on this side of the Atlantic including Apple, Amazon and Asda, which are offering special discounts. Amazon has been offering discounts all week while Asda, owned by US retailer Walmart, is planning a sale in its stores including offers of up to 70% off a range of products including plasma TVs and tablets. John Lewis is running a one-day Black Friday sale in stores and online partly because Apple will be offering discounts and its \"never knowingly undersold\" price pledge means it must match cheaper prices elsewhere. Apple's iPad Air is expected to be one of the department store's bestsellers this Christmas. Andrew Moore, Asda's chief merchandising officer for general goods, said: \"The last weekend in November is always a critical trading period in retail and with our Black Friday deals \u2013 a first for a UK supermarket \u2013 we're anticipating the busiest shopping day of the year so far.\" He said Asda would also be offering online deals on Monday. The focus on discounting during retailers' biggest sales period when many stores make the majority of their annual profits is a risky new trend. It comes as retailers expect shoppers to spend \u00a340.3bn in the runup to Christmas. That total is just 3.5% more than last year, as wage rises have failed to keep up with inflation. More than 25m British consumers are expected to spend in pre-Christmas sales this year, spending an average \u00a3174 each according to research from RedEye, which claims that more than half of shoppers will shun the January sales in favour of finding discounts in November and December. Mark Patron, chief executive of RedEye, said: \"Britain has become a nation of discount junkies.\" Mark Lewis, online director at John Lewis, said that the retailer had decided to launch its own deals this year, as well as price-matching competitors' discounts, because the Black Friday idea was catching on with British shoppers. \"Black Friday has really caught the imagination of our customers. Last year we felt they really engaged with it and so we would go a step further.\" He said that interest would kick off early in the morning as shoppers used their mobile phones to get the best deals as soon as they woke up in the same way as they did during the recent launches of the games console XBox One and Apple's latest gadget, the iPad Air. Online sales are expected to peak on Sunday and Monday, but shoppers are increasingly prepared to spend closer to Christmas as delivery services become more reliable. Many stores will now deliver up until 23 December.",

Beyond that, its focus should be on delivering improved performance and increased capacity on the railways.</p> <p>\"The company is currently operating with a large underspend and a significant shortfall against the performance targets it signed up to. It is also behind schedule on its own maintenance and renewal plans. These factors are now contributing to delays to rail passenger and freight services.\"</p> <p>The ORR said routine maintenance activity on track had fallen by about 30-40% since 2007.</p> <p>Rail union RMT said the ORR's findings backed their warnings about maintenance cuts, but said the regulator should also shoulder the blame.</p> <p>Its general secretary, Bob Crow, said: \"The report makes it clear that major delays to services are wholly bound up with Network Rail's deferral of works for parts of the rail network such as tracks, level crossings and electrification. That is a shocking indictment on the state of Britain's railways while the private train operators are creaming off a fortune.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"Only last month the ORR demanded a further \u00a31.7bn of cuts from Network Rail, cuts which would hack back skeleton staffing levels and drag back maintenance and renewals even further.</p> <p>\"ORR have got a nerve complaining about the impact of the cuts on one hand and then doling out another bunch with the other.\"</p> <p>A Network Rail spokesman said it acknowledged it was not hitting regulatory targets, but had opted to keep services running rather than cancelling trains to meet targets, in the interests of passengers.</p> <p>He said: \"The real issue here is capacity and a largely Victorian infrastructure being pushed to its limits.

Our railway is congested and any incident \u2013 be it track, train or trespass \u2013 has massive knock-on effects.</p> <p>\"We believe our regulator needs to help us to address this capacity issue rather than focus exclusively on one narrow punctuality target.\"</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Network Rail faces a fine of up to \u00a380m if it does not address worsening punctuality on the railways brought about by a \u00a31.2bn underspend on maintenance, the industry regulator has warned. The Office of Rail Regulation said the operator of Britain's rail infrastructure was responsible for more than half the delays on the network, and half of those were from problems in infrastructure. It said deferring work and neglecting maintenance had contributed to a 5% rise in infrastructure failings to almost 16,000 incidents between April and October. The ORR said that while Network Rail had made progress in reducing some types of delays, analysis published on Thursday showed that track, telecoms and cable faults were increasing. Network Rail missed some punctuality targets by between 0.9 and 5.1 percentage points, it said, with long-distance train services the worst affected. The regulator said 27,000 long-distance train services were either cancelled or more than 10 minutes late over the year, with only 86.6% on time \u2013 a performance that could lead to the imposition of an \u00a380m fine. The ORR pointed to the failure to spend nearly \u00a31.2bn allocated for maintenance and renewal over the last four years. Alan Price, the ORR's director of railway planning and performance, said: \"Safety has to be Network Rail's top priority. Beyond that, its focus should be on delivering improved performance and increased capacity on the railways. \"The company is currently operating with a large underspend and a significant shortfall against the performance targets it signed up to. It is also behind schedule on its own maintenance and renewal plans. These factors are now contributing to delays to rail passenger and freight services.\" The ORR said routine maintenance activity on track had fallen by about 30-40% since 2007. Rail union RMT said the ORR's findings backed their warnings about maintenance cuts, but said the regulator should also shoulder the blame. Its general secretary, Bob Crow, said: \"The report makes it clear that major delays to services are wholly bound up with Network Rail's deferral of works for parts of the rail network such as tracks, level crossings and electrification. That is a shocking indictment on the state of Britain's railways while the private train operators are creaming off a fortune.\" But he added: \"Only last month the ORR demanded a further \u00a31.7bn of cuts from Network Rail, cuts which would hack back skeleton staffing levels and drag back maintenance and renewals even further. \"ORR have got a nerve complaining about the impact of the cuts on one hand and then doling out another bunch with the other.\" A Network Rail spokesman said it acknowledged it was not hitting regulatory targets, but had opted to keep services running rather than cancelling trains to meet targets, in the interests of passengers. He said: \"The real issue here is capacity and a largely Victorian infrastructure being pushed to its limits. Asset failures make up a small proportion of why trains are late. Our railway is congested and any incident \u2013 be it track, train or trespass \u2013 has massive knock-on effects. \"We believe our regulator needs to help us to address this capacity issue rather than focus exclusively on one narrow punctuality target.\"",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has risked a further escalation of the Royal Mail privatisation row by putting a price target on the shares of 610p despite telling the government that the business should be floated at 330p last month. Analysts at Goldman said the postal group's valuation should benefit from an increase in parcel deliveries, despite falling letter volumes. The investment bank's 12-month price target of 610p represents an 85% premium on the flotation price, and gave further ammunition to those critics of the privatisation who argue the government sold off Royal Mail too cheaply. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"This raises yet more questions for ministers on their apparent failure to secure maximum value for the taxpayer in the Royal Mail fire sale. \"While Vince Cable has dismissed concerns that taxpayers may have been short-changed by hundreds of millions of pounds as 'froth', analysts at the bank which advised the deal are predicting that it could rise still further.\" If Goldman is correct the company's value would rise to just above \u00a36bn in a year's time, compared with its flotation value of \u00a33.3bn.

Cable insisted on Wednesday that Royal Mail had not been sold too cheaply when questioned by members of the BIS committee. Cable and Michael Fallon, the business minister who handled the flotation, said they decided against increasing the sale price by 20p a share because the market was already jittery over a potential US debt default. Senior executives from Goldman were among those to be questioned last week by the same committee, over their role in advising the government on the flotation.

Nonetheless, news of the Ireland problems has hit RSA's shares and raised doubts over the future of its embattled chief executive, Simon Lee. In February, RSA cut its annual dividend by 20%, to 7.3p a share, for last year, after complaining of poor returns from its bond investments.

It seems logical that taking away the cheap funding behind these deals will mean rates start to rise.</p> <p>\"Rates won't necessarily leap up, but you will see them ticking up,\" says David Hollingworth of broker London &amp; Country. \"We had already got to the point where they had bottomed out anyway.\"</p> <p>The good news for borrowers is that funds aren't being switched off on 31 December. Banks will still be able to use their undrawn allowances for new lending, they just won't be able to apply for any more, which should mean the market does not change overnight.

And Merkel is still queen of Europe\".</p> <p>Here's why:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the Eurozone and the wider EU question, as always, the German rhetoric is strongly in favour of further EU integration, with the agreement calling it \u201cthe most important task facing Germany\u201d. However, it also rejects all forms of debt pooling. This confirms, once again, that when the Germans talk of more integration, they mean stronger central control over taxation and spending, not fiscal and political union. A recent Open Europe poll showed that 64 per cent of Germans oppose debt mutualisation.</p> <p>And despite language promoting \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, ultimately the agreement concludes that austerity and consolidation of national budgets remains the main remedy to exit the crisis, albeit with more emphasis on structural reform.</p> <p>The coalition has also committed to new \u201creform contracts\u201d, where struggling euro countries will agree to structural reforms in exchange for further aid. This is an idea floated by Merkel in the lead up to the elections, and is politically feasible for the Germans, as it involves more control over Eurozone spending and reforms for potentially less cash. Unlike debt pooling or yet more ad hoc rescue packages, Merkel might get it past her bailout-fatigued public. However, making these contracts enforceable could set Germany up for a major battle.</p> <p>Finally, on the much-heralded banking union, there\u2019s little detail, although the agreement does say that the banking sector itself will pay in the event of crisis.

Coverage of the Bank of England's changes to Funding for Lending start here, with Mark Carney saying the BoE is keen to guarantee financial stability, With reaction from here. Goldman Sachs's research note setting a 610p price target for Royal Mail - 85% higher than the float price - are here; and the Labour Party's concerns are covered here. While Japan's stock market rally overnight is summed up here. I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, goodnight. GW The Financial Times is reporting tonight that one of the two hedge funds that were large holders of Co-op Bank's bonds have sold almost all their holding, to another fund. Aurelius Capital sold \"virtually all its holding\" to Perry Capital, a London-based hedge fund \u2013 within days of the first allegations of drug-buying emerged against ex-Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers, the FT says. Here's the story. This morning, the Co-op warned that it was finding it harder to win new current account customers since the scandal broke: Co-op Bank losing battle for new current accounts I began the day with the news of the Japanese stock market closing at a near six-year high. Capital Economics predict tonight that the rally has further to go. Julian Jessop writes: The Nikkei has now passed our end-2013 target of 15,500, closing on Thursday on 15,727. While reluctant to tweak the numbers just to chase the market higher, we see no reason why our end-2014 forecast of 16,250 cannot be reached (much) sooner than we had anticipated too. Admittedly, the decline in the yen may now pause for breath ahead of next Friday\u2019s crucial US employment report and the FOMC decision on 18th December, as speculation of Fed tapering could sap risk appetite again. Nonetheless, Japanese stocks should still benefit next month from the likely announcement of cuts in the corporate tax burden to help offset the impact of the consumption tax hike next April. Europe's stock markets are shut, with UK house builders leading the fallers in London. Persimmon lost 6%, Taylor Wimpey lost 6% and Bellway and Bovis both dropped 5%, after the Bank of England announced today it was withdrawing its support for mortgage lending. With Persimmon leading the FTSE 100 fallers, the blue chip index rose just 5 points. Over in Germany, the DAX kept climbing to its highest ever closing price, up 36 points at 9387. This blog is no stranger to eurozone strikes and protests -- but today's photos of industrial action come from Germany, rather than a country in Europe's struggling periphery: These are workers at EADS's Airbus factory in Bremen. EADS staff across Germany walked off the job today in protest at the firms restructuring plans. EADS is merging its defense and space subsidiaries, and could sell off some smaller units. More details are due on December 5th - unions may be getting their retaliation in first. More details here Back to the Bank of England's Financial Stability Report...and Andrew Tyrie, head of the influential Treasury committee, has welcomed today's moves. Here's the quote: \u201cThe Bank is clearing the decks of exceptional simulative measures, put in place to encourage mortgage lending. It has also taken the opportunity to put on display some powerful weapons for reining in the market, should they subsequently be needed. \u201cThe FPC is a new body with a vital role to play. The more detailed explanation we received today of how it will operate and the tools it may use is particularly welcome. Just as an act of signalling it can also help secure the FPC\u2019s objectives.\u201d Those 'powerful weapons' include the ability to make recommendations on underwriting standards, loan to value ratios, and government's Help to Buy scheme. Goldman Sachs' prediction this morning that Royal Mail's share price will have risen to around 610p in 12 month's time is further evidence that the postal operator's flotation may have been bungled, the Labour party has warned. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna MP said the forecast undermines business secretary Vince Cable's claim that the spike from the 330p float price is 'merely froth'. The prediction was made in research published by Goldman's equity analysts this morning. That 330p float price was set following advice from bankers at Goldman and UBS, who were hired to help run the float. Umunna said: This raises yet more questions for ministers on their apparent failure to secure maximum value for the taxpayer in the Royal Mail fire sale. While Vince Cable has dismissed concerns that taxpayers may have been short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds as \u2018froth\u2019, analysts at the bank which advised the deal are predicting that it could rise still further. This comes a day after ministers\u2019 case for the sale of Royal Mail was further undermined by the fact its profits in the first six months of this year had doubled in public ownership. Scroll back to 10.21am post for full details of the analysis. It was published a day after Cable and business minister Michael Fallon insisted that taxpayers had not missed out. Here's a graph from Goldman's note (which gave a 'neutral' valuation on Royal Mail), showing why it expects steady revenue growth at Royal Mail. Royal Mail's share price is down 1.7% today, at 554p - around 67% above the 330p float price. Adrian Bailey, chair of the BIS committee which is investigating the IPO, has suggested that Goldman Sachs could be hauled back for another grilling (managing director James Robertson appeared as a witness last week). Bailey told International Business Times that the 610p price tag will confirm suspicions that investment bankers had an inkling that Royal Mail was worth more than the float price of \u00a33,3bn. You have to question why there is this analysis now and another analysis at a much lower price that they defended vigorously only just over a week ago. What's happened that's different and what information is different now than what they had before? Arising from this I think there are further questions that need to be asked. The BIS committee will produce a full report on the Royal Mail float. Here's a video clip of Mark Carney announcing the changes to Funding for Lending, and the decision to stop letting banks use it for household lending. Now for the political reaction. Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, says the changes to the Funding for Lending scheme show that it has \"badly failed Britain\u2019s businesses\". Net lending to business is down since the scheme was introduced and by over \u00a312 billion in the last year alone. We called for the scheme to prioritise lending to business and, after three wasted years when net lending to firms has fallen, the government is belatedly acting. But homeowners facing a cost-of-living crisis will want reassurance from Ministers that suddenly taking the scheme away from mortgage lending won't see a rise in mortgage rates. On that last point -- it feels likely that there will be some upward pressure on rates in future, even though Mark Carney insisted that the mortgage market doesn't need the cushion of FLS any more. Funding for Lending was a boon for UK banks because it allowed them to borrow at as little as 0.25 percentage points above the Bank's of England's base rate (0.5%). John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce , says it's vital that banks use this opportunity to fund vibrant young firms with big growth potential. They're failing on this today, he says, by cautiously backing established companies instead: \u201cThe real test for Funding for Lending has always been whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast-growing companies and long term, non equity capital to firms that want to expand. Unfortunately any improvement in credit availability is only being felt by \u2018safe bets', while younger, growing firms continue to struggle to find the finance they need to expand.\" My colleague Hilary Osborne has rattled out a Q&amp;A on the changes announced today - it's here. Funding for Lending Q&amp;A: shift in Bank of England policy Here's a couple of points: What does it mean for mortgages? Funding for Lending is the reason mortgage rates have fallen to record lows this year, with lenders competing to offer the cheapest fixed-rate deals ever seen. It seems logical that taking away the cheap funding behind these deals will mean rates start to rise. \"Rates won't necessarily leap up, but you will see them ticking up,\" says David Hollingworth of broker London &amp; Country. \"We had already got to the point where they had bottomed out anyway.\" The good news for borrowers is that funds aren't being switched off on 31 December. Banks will still be able to use their undrawn allowances for new lending, they just won't be able to apply for any more, which should mean the market does not change overnight. As of June, some of the big banks had many millions unlent, but some smaller lenders had used up their reserves. Another positive sign is that the Council of Mortgage Lenders says funding conditions outside the scheme have improved. So it seems reasonable to expect the end of record-breaking rates without fearing massive increases. Will I still be able to get a loan? It might be tougher \u2013 not because of the removal of Funding for Lending, but because the BoE has also asked the regulator to enforce what could be tougher affordability tests on mortgage lending. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckoned today's changes are \"not a nail in the coffin\" for the Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme. Instead, it's: a) the shape of things to come on central bank policy, and happens so often, flagged up by introduction of similar policies in New Zealand, and very much along the lines of what Carney did in Canada, b) it goes to prove that the FLS has been far more effective than the feckless \"spaghetti principle' of QE, c) not an admission of a bubble, but more a sharp admonition to banks about lax standards on mortgage lending. Carl Astorri, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, points out that mortgage lending is up 40% since August 2012, compared to just 15% for business lending. He welcomed the \"greater prudence\" from the Bank, especially as the latest assessment of the UK economy in the last quarter showed business investment was lagging: Given the subdued recovery in business investment, as is evident from the Q3 expenditure breakdown, the move to reorient FLS towards businesses appears well-timed.\u201d Mark Carney will be near the top of the Federation of Small Businesses' Christmas card list. Their national chairman, John Allan, gives the governor the credit for deciding to focus Funding for Lending at SMEs, saying: This is a surprising yet refreshing announcement which will make a difference to lending to thousands of our members and millions of small firms. It is something the FSB has raised with the Governor of the Bank of England and he is clearly listening. It is encouraging that he has recognised the contribution small firms make to job creation and the real economy has been given priority over the housing market, which is receiving assistance in other areas such as Help to Buy. FLS has already helped to reduce the cost of finance for businesses. What we now need is to see a focus on increasing the number of firms getting access to the finance they need to grow.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, has welcomed the decision to stop letting banks use the FLS to subsidise household lending. He called it \"a hugely sensible and justifiable move taken by the Bank of England:, adding: With the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme only just starting to kick in and interest rates likely to stay extremely low for some time to come, there is still substantial support to the housing market even in the absence of any further support from the FLS. Furthermore, overall markedly improved consumer confidence and rising employment is likely to continue to support housing market activity. Archer also argued that \"there is little evidence of a housing bubble outside of London\", as October's Land Registry data showed prices fell 0.2%. House prices were up 8.7% year-on-year in London but outside London and the South East (up 4.0%), no other region saw annual house price growth in excess of 4.0% in October, and prices were still falling year-on-year in the North West (down 0.7%) and North East (down 0.8%). TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has welcomed the move, calling it ...good news for the real economy, but bad news for the Chancellor. The Bank of England is clearly worried that the economic recovery is based on consumers borrowing on the back of rising house prices rather than business investment and rising exports. Ensuring that funding for lending works to boost business investment is a sensible policy that can drive sustainable growth and help build a new economy. But stopping over-excitement in the property market may hit the feel-good factor that the Chancellor is hoping will distract from the failure of government policy to rebalance the economy. The TUC's invaluable economist, Duncan Weldon, has also written a fuller explanation here: Funding for Lending: A Big &amp; Important Change In it, he argues that household borrowing has been a major factor in the UK recovery, with people taking advantage of easier credit conditions and the fact they felt wealthier due to house price rises. Our recovery to date has been focussed on rising consumption underpinned by rising household borrowing. Today\u2019s action from the Bank may well cool it. The hope is that business investment will kick in as a more solid component of growth \u2013although that has yet to really begin. Weldon also suspects that the Bank, rather than the Treasury, is the driving force behind the changes. The pound has hit a 14-month high against a basket of currencies, including an 11-month high of $1.635 against the US dollar. Chancellor George Osborne tweeted that today's changes are being made because lending to businesses still isn't \"good enough\" As mentioned earlier, Mark Carney said the changes to FLS were made jointly between the Treasury and the Bank - trying to avoid any impression of a row between the two sides. Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal isn't impressed with Mark Carney's argument that the Bank will be able to maintain easy monetary policy for longer: Jill Treanor's full story on the Bank of England's changes is updated, and online here: Bank of England refocuses FLS away from mortgages Finally, Ed Conway of Sky News seeks more clarity on the Bank's powers on LTVs - the Loan to Value ratios which lenders use when assessing the suitability of a potential borrower and how much they should lend. Would you rather have the power to make a direction on LTV ratios, rather than a recommendation? Carney says that Bank has a wide range of tools, and as he sits here today he feels they are \"considerable\" and should be adequate. He cautions, though, that this is based on the belief that if the Bank made a recommendation on LTV it would be followed. And again, the governor reiterates that there's a considerable toolkit to hand, we've used a proportion of it in a proportionate way. And he stresses that the Bank would used its powers in a calibrated way - he wouldn't just deploy them once. Another question about Scottish independence. Carney says he has not had a meeting yet with the Scottish government, although his predecessor (Mervyn King) did have some some \"very basic discussions with Mr [Alex] Salmond\" in the last couple of years. I would welcome the opportunity for a meeting, Carney adds. So why has a meeting not happened? They've been busy writing their report*...I've been busy... There has been an effort to set up a meeting, and I'm sure it will happen, Carney adds. * - the 600-plus page White Paper published this week. Claire Jones of the FT challenges Carney on whether the Bank can be confidence that the relatively untested tools for financial stability will work as they hope. Carney replies that went through through a housing bust when he lived in the UK before (he studied at Oxford in the early 1990s). I know the damage that can be done if the market is left unchecked, he adds. The governor insists that today's changes, and the remaining tools at the BOE's disposal, are sensible. Why would we stand by and let mortgage underwriting standards fall? Why should we provide funding to underpin a housing market when it's no longer necessary? And he repeats that the changes will help maintain accommodative monetary policy for longer. My colleague Jill Treanor asks Andrew Bailey about the situation at Co-op Bank. Bailey says that standards of governance over bank appointments has been tightened up since Paul Flowers joined the Co-op board and was later 'informally' interviewed to become chairman. Today, the process is \"very different\", Bailey insists. Senior people at the BoE are much more closely involved.. \"I would be involved\". He adde that the Bank of England required a restructuring of the Co-op Bank's board while Flowers was chairman. And on the Co-op's disastrous bid for Lloyds Branches, Bailey says he didn't know the full story - which is why an inquiry is needed - but he says the Bank of England acted properly by stating its concerns over Co-op's capital levels. He concludes that it is the \u00a31.5bn capital black hole at Co-op that caused the current situation , not the Reverend Flowers \"antics\". Another question on the impact on the mortgage market. Carney says that the Bank still sees \"near-term momentum\" in mortgage approvals and prices. It's partly demand driven -- people feel more confidence about job prospects. there's pent-up demand, perhaps because of marriages or children. \"All the reasons people move house\". Mark Carney declines to answer a question on Scottish independence, on whether he's worried that the Bank could become the lender of last resort to a bank it doesn't directly regulate. It's not right to give a couple of sentences on this issue, he says -- we'll present our \"technocratic, boring\" position properly in the right venue at the right time. In the financial markets, shares in British housebuilders have tumbled since the news broke. Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey are both down 7%. Investors may be calculating that the changes to Funding for Lending, and the prospect of tighter rules on mortgage lending in the future, will hit house builders profits. The decision to remove mortgage lending from the Funding for Lending Scheme (which allows banks to borrow from the BoE at generous terms) was taken jointly with chancellor George Osborne, Carney says. A question about the claims that Royal Bank of Scotland deliberately undermined, or even destroyed, its own small business customers. Deputy governor Andrew Bailey says there must be serious investigation of these very serious allegations, but that this must not distract from looking into the wider issue of the mechanics of lending to SMEs. Explaining the decision to remove mortgages from the Funding for Lending Scheme, Mark Carney adds that it's no longer appropriate or necessary to have the foot on the accelerator; better to move into neutral. Does Mark Carney agree that Funding for Lending has been a main factor in driving house prices up? And what's the consequence of today's changes? The governor replies that he \"does not expect a material change\" to the market. When FLS was brought in, there was extreme stress on bank funding. There has been marked improvement since then, so it acts mainly as a \"backstop\". Governor Carney makes a key point -- that if the Financial Policy Committee does its job, of protecting that financial stability of the UK, it will be easier for the Monetary Policy Committee to maintain extremely accommodative monetary policy to secure the recovery. In other words, prevent a housing bubble today and we can keep interest rates low tomorrow. Carney explains that Bank is developing various new tools for the mortgage market. It is consulting on a tool which would mean that the FPC could instruct banks and building societies immediately change the long-term forecasts for interest rates which they use when assessing affordability. So if the FPC saw a risk of higher rates in the money markets in five years, it could make banks take that into account. The press conference is being streamed here, btw (sorry for not adding the link sooner). Is the government's Help to Buy scheme (which provides subsidies to some borrowers) making financial stability worse? Carney says that Help to Buy is still at its early stage. The Bank can provide advice to the Government if it should conclude that it is a threat to stability. Carney is reminded that the Bank has played down the idea of risks in the housing market in previous statements. The governor replies that the market is still not booming -- mortgages approvals are still at three-quarters of their pre-crisis high. We don't want to risk a deterioration in underwriting standards for mortgages, he adds. Mark Carney is taking questions at the Bank of England press conference on its financial stability report, and the decision to stop banks using Funding for Lending Scheme to fund mortgages. Richard Edgar of ITV goes first -- is the Bank making these changes because it's worried about house prices? Carney replies that the Bank doesn't see \"an immediate threat\", but an \"evolving threat\". \"The concern is where this could go\", Carney explains, adding that prices have risen from a relatively high base already. From the Bank of England, Jill Treanor reports: The Bank of England on Thursday took the first steps to ensure a housing bubble does not emerge by removing some of the stimulus from mortgage market. While stressing that the housing market is not immediate risk to financial stability, the Bank is forcing banks to hold more capital against mortgage lending through existing guarantee schemes. The annual heath check of Britain's banks being introduced next year will also require banks to look at their resilience to housing shocks. And the Bank's financial policy committee -set up to look for the next bubbles in the financial system - is also requiring the Financial Conduct Authority to force banks to embark on tougher tests when deciding if a customer can afford a mortgage. In a letter to Chancellor George Osborne, the Bank's governor Mark Carney set out the changes to the funding for lending (fls) scheme which has led to a fall in bank funding costs since it was introduced in July 2012. Carney said that the fls would try to focus more on lending to the business sector and a relaxation in capital rules that had been applied to mortgage lending would be removed. \"Although the growth in household loan volumes remain modest, activity is picking up and house price momentum appears to be gaining momentum,\" Carney told the Chancellor. However there are no changes to the help to buy scheme which the Bank will assess annually from 2014 and in its half yearly check on the risks to financial stability, the Bank said there was not a risk to the financial system from the housing market. More to follow.... BIG NEWS: The Bank of England is revising its Funding For Lending Scheme to focus on small businesses, rather than to fund mortgage lending. It means that, from next year, banks will not be able to use the Funding For Lending Scheme to support mortgage loans. Governor Mark Carney is explaining that the change will help to reinforce financial stability, and that the UK mortgage sector no longer needs this specific help. It is also a response to evolving risks in the housing market, he says. By acting now in a graduated fashion, we are lowering the risk that a larger intervenion will be needed in future, says Carney at a press conference in London. The news comes as the BoE publishes its financial stability report. Here's the announcement. Nearly time for Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to present his first Financial Stability Report - it should hit the wires at 10.30am.... Goldman Sachs has added to concerns over the Royal Mail privatisation by setting a 12-month target for its shares of 610p this morning. That's an 85% premium on the 330p share price which the government floated the postal operator in October, a deal in which Goldman Sachs investment bankers played a role. If Goldman's Equity Research team are right, Royal Mail have a stock market valuation of more than \u00a36bn in a year's time, compared to the \u00a33.3bn it was valued at in October's float. Shares in Royal Mail rallied to 565p yesterday after it reported a doubling in profits for its last six months as a public company. Goldman, which gave Royal Mail a \"neutral\" valuation, believes it will rise around 8% over the next year. In the 53-page analyst note, Goldman said that Royal Mail should benefit from \"network modernisation and labour force rationalisation\" in future years, and also predicted that the firm's margins should improve. Goldman added that its valuation did not include the risk of a strike action, as \"we now view the near-term strike risk as relatively low\". Ministers have blamed the threat of industrial action as one factor which meant City investors would not pay over 330p per share. The analysts who produced today's note are quite separate from the bankers who advised the government. Here's Goldman's investment view: With c.50% of its revenues coming from growth-exposed parcel markets, an extensive UK Core Network asset providing a competitive cost advantage, and margin upside opportunity from productivity improvements, we believe Royal Mail (RMG) is well-placed to deliver a double-digit EBIT CAGR [Compound Annual Growth Rate] of 17.5% over four years. We expect further network modernisation and labour force rationalisation to drive the EBIT margin to 7.5% in FY17E (from 4.4% FY13). We forecast a progressive dividend payout ratio, from 56% (FY14E), rising to 65% in FY17E. We initiate with a Neutral rating given limited sector-relative upside. Core drivers of growth We expect the 32% of sales coming from UK parcels to deliver good revenue growth, driven by online retail spend and Royal Mail Group\u2019s unique competitive advantage afforded it by a dual-use core network. With further modest growth coming from EU parcels (via GLS, 16% of sales) we expect group parcel growth to more than offset continued letter volume declines. We forecast network modernisation (parcel automation and logistics optimisation) to drive productivity improvements and facilitate headcount reduction, delivering further margin improvement . But there are risks, as ministers have pointed out in their defence of the IPO... Risks to the investment case Key risks include the competitive threat from Access operators, regulatory changes, letter volume declines and VAT exemption-loss. Yesterday, Business secretary Vince Cable insisted that Royal Mail had not been sold too cheaply. But members of the Business, Innovations and Skills committee fear that the government was \"conned\" by its investment bankers. Goldman and UBS were hired to help run the flotation, including the \"fishing expedition\" to find how much City investors would pay for Royal Mail shares in the float. Here's some more detail from the report: Germany's seasonally unemployment rate remains at 6.9% in November, the country's Federal Labour Office reports. But the total number of people out of work rose by more than expected -- by 10,000, versus forecasts of 1,000. That pushed the seasonally adjusted jobless total up to 2.985m, from 2.975m in October, to the highest total since April 2011. If you don't adjust for seasonal factors, the unemployment total rose by 5,000 people this month to 2.806m (giving an unadjusted jobless rate of 6.5%). On the German coalition deal, Open Europe analyst Nina Schick reckons it will make little difference to the country's approach to the eurozone. Writing in City AM, she argues that the agreement means \" Germany is still Germany. And Merkel is still queen of Europe\". Here's why: On the Eurozone and the wider EU question, as always, the German rhetoric is strongly in favour of further EU integration, with the agreement calling it \u201cthe most important task facing Germany\u201d. However, it also rejects all forms of debt pooling. This confirms, once again, that when the Germans talk of more integration, they mean stronger central control over taxation and spending, not fiscal and political union. A recent Open Europe poll showed that 64 per cent of Germans oppose debt mutualisation. And despite language promoting \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, ultimately the agreement concludes that austerity and consolidation of national budgets remains the main remedy to exit the crisis, albeit with more emphasis on structural reform. The coalition has also committed to new \u201creform contracts\u201d, where struggling euro countries will agree to structural reforms in exchange for further aid. This is an idea floated by Merkel in the lead up to the elections, and is politically feasible for the Germans, as it involves more control over Eurozone spending and reforms for potentially less cash. Unlike debt pooling or yet more ad hoc rescue packages, Merkel might get it past her bailout-fatigued public. However, making these contracts enforceable could set Germany up for a major battle. Finally, on the much-heralded banking union, there\u2019s little detail, although the agreement does say that the banking sector itself will pay in the event of crisis. But make no mistake, progress will remain very slow. The German stock market has hit yet another record high this morning, as it's been doing repeatedly in recent weeks. Not a big move -- the DAX is up just 0.2%, or 20 points, to 9371, in a mood of mild optimism over the German coalition government deal agreed yesterday. On that, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been discussing the plan agreed between his CDU/CSU party and the Social Democrats. Reuters has the details: Sch\u00e4uble said on Thursday that plans for additional spending of \u20ac23bn euros outlined in a new coalition deal were realistic and could be financed, partly with the help of hidden reserves. \"This is a cautious, realistic but of course ambitious plan,\" Sch\u00e4uble told German radio, adding it would not be possible to finance more ambitious spending plans proposed by the Social Democrats (SPD). Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, of which Sch\u00e4uble is a member, agreed a coalition deal with the SPD in the early hours of Wednesday although SPD members still have to vote for the agreement for it to take effect. The plan includes a lower retirement age for some workers and a minimum wage of \u20ac8.50/hour (which were both key SPD demands), and an agreement that overall taxes won't rise (as sought by the CDU). Wolseley, the FTSE 100 plumbing and building suppliers firm, has also reported tough times in the French market. Like-for-like revenue in France fell by 4.8% in the three months to the end of October, which it blamed on continued weakness in the new residential market and \"negligible\" inflation. In the Nordic region, comparable revenues were down 2.6%, and they fell by 2.9% in Central Europe. On a happier note for the company -- which is a good measure of demand in the housing market - they rose 7% in the US and 4% in the UK. The statement's online here. Retail group Kingfisher has been bruised by France's weak economy. It told shareholders this morning that it sees no signs of improvement in consumer morale in France - a key area for the company - underlining how the eurozone's second-largest member is struggling. Kingfisher's profits in France shrank by 5.6% in the last three months, taking the shine off an 8.3% rise in profits in UK and Ireland. Chief executive Ian Cheshire said: Whilst we have delivered sales growth in each of our geographies our markets remain challenging, especially in France where consumer confidence is still weak and with no obvious signs of an imminent improvement. Galling news for shareholders -- who sent Kingfisher's shares sliding over 5% this morning to the bottom of the FTSE 100. Confirmation that Spain's recession is over, and that its recovery is rather weak. Official data released this morning showed that GDP grew by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year, in line with the initial estimate. On an annual basis, the Spanish economy remains 1.1% smaller than a year ago. Here's how the Nikkei's performance over the last five years: And today's best performers: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Let's start with Japan, where the Nikkei stock market index of the biggest Japanese companies has just finished at its highest closing level in almost six years. Shares in Japanese manufacturers rose pretty strongly today, as the value of the yen against the dollar fell back -- boosting hopes that exports will benefit. Asia is also taking its cue from Wall Street, where the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 indices also closed at record high last night. More grist to the mill of those who fear that global stock markets have been driven too high, given the tender state of the global recovery.... ..but enough to send the Nikkei bounding 1.8% higher to 15727.12, a closing level not seen since the end of 2007, as the financial crisis began. The yen fell as low as \u00a5102.27 against the US dollar, further over the 100 yen mark seen as important for the Tokyo government's plan to stimulate growth and inflation. As Hiroyuki Fukunaga, the chief executive of Investrust, put it: The yen's weakness is lifting hopes for even higher profits for exporters this fiscal year. The US dollar strengthened after generally decent economic out of America last night; some economists believe the Federal Reserve is closer to slowing its bond-buying stimulus programme. Reuters explains: \"The U.S. economic data were very pro-tapering, despite the weakness in the durable goods data,\" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup, wrote in a note. The Indonesian rupiah fell to its psychological support at 12,000 per dollar, the first time since March 2009. The currency is seen vulnerable to capital outflows once the U.S. Federal Reserve begins dialling back the massive stimulus that has fuelled asset prices in emerging markets. And there was a general air of optimism across the region, according to IG's man in Melbourne, Stan Shamu: Asia is enjoying a solid day after US equities remained at all-time highs heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Japan is leading a buoyant session in Asia after a fresh round of yen weakness. This also saw the Chinese CSI index rose 1%. Also coming up today\u2026 The Bank of England's financial policy committee will release its latest assessment of the stability of the UK economy, at 10.30am. Governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference. And there's various economic data to digest -- including: \u2022 German unemployment data, and inflation data (1pm GMT) \u2022 the European Commission's economic sentiment survey for November (10am GMT) I'll also try to take a closer look on the impact of yesterday's German coalition deal on the euro area (something that got neglected yesterday as I was buried under a blizzard of Royal Mail news)\u2026..",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has faced down George Osborne. That much is clear after he slammed the brakes on the chancellor's goal of a booming housing market sweeping him and the Tories back into power in 2015. The Bank of England boss is rightly scared of a runaway mortgage market. In his comments following publication of the Bank of England's financial stability report, the governor said price rises could soon turn into an express train with only one brake: an interest-rate hike. Starkly put, the mortgage market is a threat to the low interest rates currently supporting the economy and its ability to recover. While the bank often talks about having an array of financial controls in its toolbox, its main weapon against a bubble is an interest-rate hike. Using this blunt weapon must be avoided, he warned, because there were still large parts of the economy struggling to survive. In the north-west, the East Midlands and north-east there are plenty of businesses still dependent on low-cost credit. The Bank of England governor knows that the British mortgage market can quickly get out of control. He talked about it gathering momentum of an unstoppable nature. For that reason he has withdrawn the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) provided by the bank. He said: \"The changes announced today refocus FLS where it is most needed without providing further broad support to households.\" It is needed, he says, by small businesses that are still starved of credit. What's going on in the small business market is still a subject of furious debate, especially following the allegations against Royal Bank of Scotland that it profited from putting viable businesses into liquidation. Is there a lack of supply or can it be that businesses are reluctant to borrow? With reference to RBS, are banks manipulating overdrafts and loans and charges to maximise profit at the expense of small businesses? Without answers to these questions, whether an extension of the FLS for small businesses will help is a moot point. What is clear is that the housing market needs little encouragement to motor ahead. And Carney was clear that the Bank's Financial Policy Committee believes it will continue growing in the near term even without the FLS. But what is curious is that this is not only a U-turn for Osborne, who must publicly support calming measures he was only recently saying were not needed, but also a U-turn for Carney. He was saying until only last month that all the other prudential tools available \u2013 restrictions on loan-to-values and improved underwriting standards by banks \u2013 would keep a lid on the market. Now that seems to be too weak. If he is to maintain his new course, without further U-turns, we can expect a damning report on Help to Buy. It's that or higher interest rates.",

      "bodyText": "The Grattan Institute this week published a report which confronted the problem of the ageing population and also revealed how big a political issue it has become. Despite the report also suggesting the GST be broadened to include food and education, overwhelmingly the media attention focused on the report\u2019s suggestion to raise the retirement age. Currently the retirement age is 65, but it will increase by six months every two years from 2017 until it reaches 67 in 2025. This means that those born after 1 January 1957 will have to wait until they are 67 to retire. The reason the Grattan Institute and others such as the productivity commission believe the retirement age should be lifted to 70 can be summed up in two graphs. The first is the life expectancy of people aged 65. Back when the pension was introduced in 1909, 65-year-olds on average could expect to live for just 11 to more 12 years (depending on gender). Now a 65-year-old on average is expected to live for 18 to 22 more years. So people are on pensions for longer than they used to be \u2013 which means they cost the government more. That would be OK if we had an increase in the number of people below the retirement age working and paying tax to pay for it. But the second graph, using population projections released by the ABS on Tuesday, reveals the opposite is occurring: In 2000, 56% of the adult population was in the prime working age of 25 to 54, and only 16% were over 65. Just 13 years later, those in the prime working age have dropped by four percentage points to 52%, and the over 65s have increased by two percentage points to 18%. This trend is expected to continue such that by 2050 (ie when those born in 1985 turn 65) only 46% of the population will be of prime-working age, and 25% will be over 65. This issue seems straightforward, but unfortunately the \u201caverage\u201d life expectancy varies across all strata of society. Not surprisingly those on higher incomes who work non-manual labour live longer. The Victorian Health Department found in 2006 that males from the least disadvantaged 20% of the population had a life expectancy of over three and half years more than a male from the most disadvantaged 20% of the population: This increased life expectancy occurs also for those who reached 60. Those 60-year-old males from the least disadvantaged backgrounds are expected to live to 84 years and six months compared to 82 years and two months for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds: Thus raising the pension age hurts those who spend their days as labourers or working in a childcare centre more than someone who spends his days sitting behind a desk writing and making graphs (ie, me). Similarly, because the pension is means tested, those who go on the full pension are, obviously, more likely to be on lower incomes.

As a result, although economic optimism is generally increasing, businesses are not seeing the impact at their tills.\"</p> <p>The ONS breakdown of growth in the third quarter showed household spending contributed 0.5 points of the 0.8% increase, the fastest since the second quarter of 2008. Investment added 0.2 points and the increase in stocks a further 0.9 points.</p> <p>But with imports rising faster than exports, net trade subtracted 0.9 points from growth during the quarter.</p> <p>Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, said: \"To the extent that rebalancing of the UK economy is occurring, the figures strongly suggest it is in the wrong direction, towards consumption and away from net exports.</p> <p>\"It is far from clear that the pick-up in consumer spending is prompting companies to step up their capital expenditure. Spending on transport equipment, the strongest element in capital outlays over the quarter, is characteristically lumpy and not especially responsive to short-term changes in the demand outlook. The UK authorities, however, appear to have long since abandoned their rebalancing goal in favour of stimulating growth, from whatever source and at any cost.\"</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain's consumer-led recovery is losing momentum are increasing amid signs that the rising cost of living is hitting confidence and high-street spending. The latest survey of sentiment towards the economy shows that the steady rise in confidence seen the start of the year has slowed in the past month. Thursday's report from YouGov and the Centre for Economic and Business Research followed the CBI snapshot of retailing, which found that upbeat business forecasts from shops and stores had fallen short for a second month. Official data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that consumer spending was a crucial factor in the 0.8% jump in national output in the third quarter of 2013, but the CBI and YouGov/CEBR studies point to a slowing in the first weeks of the fourth quarter. The ONS's figures for GDP showed that manufacturers were increasing their stockpiles of unsold goods in the three months to September in anticipation of the surge in consumer spending, seen in the summer, continuing into the winter. Retailers are banking on consumers rushing to the shops in the last few weeks before Christmas, the CBI said, as it published its latest distributive trades survey \u2013 which showed sales volumes well down on expected levels in November despite increases in staff to cope with a hoped-for surge in spending. Mirroring other recent surveys of the retail sector, the monthly distributive trades survey suggests that the cost of living rises and news of big increases in energy bills are making consumers more cautious. Barry Williams, chief merchandising officer for food at Asda, and chair of the CBI distributive trades survey panel, said: \"This is the second month in a row that retailers' expectations for growth have been disappointed, perhaps due in part to the mild start to autumn. \"But despite challenging conditions on the high street, retailers remain optimistic for the Christmas period, and have taken on more employees in anticipation of a shopping rush that should add jingle to the tills.\" The CBI data shows department stores, grocers and clothing shops are finding trading conditions particularly tough, but the recovery in the housing market is helping sales of household goods and DIY equipment. YouGov/CEBR said consumer confidence rose in November for the 11th successive month but the boost was smaller than in any month since February and still left optimism five points below its level at the time the financial crash broke in 2007. Stephen Harmston, head of syndicated reports at YouGov, said: \"While consumer confidence is still improving it looks like it is starting to flatten out. There is now a large discrepancy opening up between how [people] feel about different areas of their economic lives. Although they are seeing house prices continuing to rise and more activity in their workplaces, these are not things that help pay the bills in the short-term. \"Add to this the fact that consumer confidence levels are still greatly below where they were before the financial crisis and it is clear why consumers \u2013 conditioned to caution \u2013 are not yet ready to spend. As a result, although economic optimism is generally increasing, businesses are not seeing the impact at their tills.\" The ONS breakdown of growth in the third quarter showed household spending contributed 0.5 points of the 0.8% increase, the fastest since the second quarter of 2008. Investment added 0.2 points and the increase in stocks a further 0.9 points. But with imports rising faster than exports, net trade subtracted 0.9 points from growth during the quarter. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, said: \"To the extent that rebalancing of the UK economy is occurring, the figures strongly suggest it is in the wrong direction, towards consumption and away from net exports. \"It is far from clear that the pick-up in consumer spending is prompting companies to step up their capital expenditure. Spending on transport equipment, the strongest element in capital outlays over the quarter, is characteristically lumpy and not especially responsive to short-term changes in the demand outlook. The UK authorities, however, appear to have long since abandoned their rebalancing goal in favour of stimulating growth, from whatever source and at any cost.\"",

The worries, some of which are highlighted in a survey from Aberdeen published on Thursday, have surfaced just days after \u00a310bn worth of new oil and gas projects \u2013 as well as a \u00a34bn windfarm \u2013 were postponed or reconsidered. Hydrocarbon output from the North Sea plunged by 14% last year and is expected to fall another 8.5% in 2013, putting greater pressure on the government amid fears over mounting energy security and rising fuel bills. The 19th Oil and Gas Survey \u2013 published by Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce and sponsored by law firm Bond Dickinson \u2013 shows strong recruitment trends and high wages. But Kenny Paton, oil and gas partner at Bond Dickinson, said more and more of his clients in oil and gas plus other sectors were raising questions about uncertainty created by the referendum in Scotland. \"This report provides more evidence that oil and gas businesses are concerned about the lack of information.

The Grampian survey showed that a 6.5% pay increase, which has helped to drive up overall industry costs, and other benefits for oil workers still left many employers struggling to find skilled staff. A record number of contractors in the oil and gas sector \u2013 98% \u2013 are looking to recruit in the next 12 months as investment in 2013 hit a record high of \u00a313.5bn. But the current level of spending is expected to fall off in the coming years, while the number of new wells drilled so far this year has already fallen to 27, compared with 41 in 2012 and 76 in 2008. At the end of last week, Shell and Statoil revealed that they were postponing the development of the \u00a34.3bn Bressay heavy oil field in the North Sea on the grounds of difficult conditions and high costs. The project was meant to extract up to 300m barrels of recoverable oil, but a spokesman for the operator, Statoil of Norway, said it had \"decided to reconsider the development concept and delayed the field development decision\". Statoil also postponed its even bigger Johan Castberg scheme in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea earlier this year, while Chevron of the US made clear its Rosebank scheme in the West of Shetland was in doubt. Chevron said the \u00a36bn project was under review despite global oil prices close to $110 (\u00a368) per barrel because it \"does not currently offer an economic value proposition that justifies proceeding with an investment of this magnitude\". Three months ago the trade body, Oil &amp; Gas UK, warned that the production efficiency of fields had fallen from 80% to 60% over the last seven years and said that several fields now cost more than \u00a340 ($65) per barrel to operate. \"Despite impressive investment in new developments, the production efficiency of existing assets has been in worrying decline, with a number of fields failing to produce as expected,\" said Malcolm Webb, chief executive of Oil &amp; Gas UK.
