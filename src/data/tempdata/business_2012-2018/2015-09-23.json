      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s plans to create new relationship with the European Union could be coordinated with far-reaching EU treaty changes to create an integrated eurozone, the controversial reforming French economics minister has said. This would be a win-win for Britain and France, Emmanuel Macron told the Guardian in an interview, but he said it depended on the precise details of what Britain was proposing. Macron said he expected treaty change to integrate the eurozone after the French and German elections in 2017: \u201cIf it is acceptable there is a good chance the British proposals could altogether be part of a treaty package,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the prior condition for me clearly is to have precise proposals from the British side in order to see what is acceptable and how it would comply\u201d. He warned Britain could not expect to be allowed an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d Europe. The former banker, who is a favourite of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is pushing through at lightning speed the most painful reforms to the heavily regulated French economic system since the second world war making him one of the continent\u2019s most controversial yet dynamic figures. With Paris frequently accused of failing to show leadership in comparison with German leader Angela Merkel, Macron is rapidly filling the void. In a bold initiative in the summer Macron co-authored an article with the German SDP\u2019s Sigmar Gabriel setting out plans to integrate the economic governance of eurozone structure, with a eurozone commissioner, resource transfers and oversight by the European parliament. George Osborne has said if the eurozone becomes more tightly integrated then settling the tensions between it and and those EU members outside the single currency is perhaps the single most important issue in the renegotiations before the UK\u2019s planned in/out referendum. Macron said: \u201cIf it is about articulating the rights of in and out [of the eurozone] countries then \u2026 it depends exactly on what your government wants. We can share the agenda of cutting red tape and enhancing competitiveness. My view is we can find a fair solution but without excessive requirements, as we have been able to do in the past. I think there is a win-win option that improves the functioning of the EU and helps to get a positive vote for the UK to be part of the EU club. \u201cBut we have to fine tune expectations and requirements In any case we cannot create a sort of EU a la carte which is not consistent with something more ambitious. To have something that is more flexible, more efficient and which is completely consistent with our strategy. \u201cWhen we created the banking union we created rights for the outs without a lot of difficulty. My view is we can find a fair solution but without excessive requirements. I think there is a win win option that improves the functioning of the EU and leads to be a positive vote for you to be part of the EU club.\u201d Discussing his efforts to reform the French economy Macron said they needed \u201ca new momentum for Europe and the euro\u201d by creating a eurozone budget, a eurozone commissioner and a eurozone parliament. He said: \u201cWe need more integration at the eurozone level. Why? Because the eurozone on its own just creates divergence. If we don\u2019t reform we are deciding de facto the dismantling of the eurozone. ... If there is a very productive centre, it just attracts all the energy to the centre and kills the periphery , and even if they try to do their best to recover, it is hard without investment and transfers.\u201d Macron added: \u201cI am sure it will require treaty change and if we are sensible for sure we have to wait until after the French and German elections in 2017 because there is no chance we will propose a treaty change one year before the elections..\u201d With French unemployment struck at 10%, and growth due to reach 1.5%, Hollande, still floundering in the polls, has risked much on Macron being able to turn round the economy in time for the presidential elections in 2017. He is pushing difficult change on every front \u2013 more flexible company-based labour laws, sunday trading, a \u00a350bn public spending cut, tax breaks for innovation, and the break up of monopolies. Unit labour costs are already below those of the Germans, he claims. He explained the need for such speed: \u201cFor me we have six to eight months to finalise labour market reforms and our reform for new economic opportunities and it is extremely important we push the debate as fast as we can. We need to do so for a very blunt reason the only way to succeed at the next election is to deliver and get results by then. Half-pregnant is not a concept.\u201d Despite the criticism from the Socialist party\u2019s left and the very different course being charted by Jeremy Corbyn in Britain, he said: \u201cI do believe what we are undertaking is the modernisation of the software of the Socialist party. We never experienced in France the equivalent of Bad Godesberg [the German revision of social democracy in 1959] or the revision of Labour\u2019s clause 4. We have a different story. So what we are trying to do is ... not just as an imitation of the third way but something brand new. The aim is to reinvent what it is to be progressive today, to be more open to globalisation. But the outcome of our policy cannot just be to reduce regulation. \u201cWhat we built right after the second world war is no longer adapted to this new economy and that makes this disruption necessary. What we have to invent is a new way to help people to take risks and at the same time to be concerned for equality, and the reform of education and health. That is a big modernisation of socialism because for some people the unique recipe was increasing public expenditure and correcting inequalities through tax.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s steelmakers are urging the government to rescue the industry from a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that has pushed one of the UK\u2019s largest steelworks to the edge of closure. UK Steel, the industry lobby group, said its members were facing their most difficult situation since privatisation 27 years ago after battling cheap imports, which are pushing down prices to unsustainable levels. The threatened closure of the largest steelworks on Teesside has sent shockwaves through the industry, leading unions and employers to call on the government for extra support. In advance of a meeting in London, the industry body said ministers needed to give steel firms \u201chalf a chance\u201d by cutting green taxes and banning cheap imports, \u201callowing it to compete on a level playing field with other steel-producing nations\u201d. The plea for government intervention comes as chancellor George Osborne continues to tour China, where figures showed local factory activity shrinking at its fastest pace in six and a half years in September, adding to a sense of gloom over the prospects for the world economy. The news sent Chinese stock markets down and will add to the concerns of global investors already fretting about the spillover effects of China\u2019s slowdown. Preliminary figures from financial publisher Caixin\u2019s closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) showed that manufacturing had slowed for the seventh consecutive month. China is the world\u2019s biggest trader in goods, so lower demand for its products is expected to drive prices down further. Poor manufacturing figures from the US heightened concerns that the global slowdown is rippling out to developed markets. UK Steel said the beleaguered sector, which employs 30,000 people, often in areas with higher than average unemployment, was struggling to cope with falling prices, made worse by the recent strengthening of the pound. Prices of rolled steel have climbed in recent months but remain well below levels seen last year. At the weekend, the business minister, Anna Soubry, said she was aware of the threat to the industry from dumping by rival producers and high energy costs. \u201cWe help with energy costs and recently voted to protect our steel industry from Chinese dumping,\u201d she said. Soubry, who is in north-west China with the chancellor, said she would raise the issue of steel dumping with Beijing. The owners of the works in Teesside, SSI, have announced a \u201cpause\u201d in iron and steelmaking, as well as the mothballing of one of its coke ovens. The Thai-owned firm is struggling to pay outstanding debts to its parent company dating back to a buyout from previous owner Corus, leading to speculation about how long it could keep going while employing 2,000 staff and 1,000 contractors. UK Steel said: \u201cAs well as battling against falling prices, a rise in unfairly traded steel imports and a persistently strong pound, the sector is being hit by disproportionate policy and business costs, higher than those faced by both global and European competitors. These costs include an additional \u00a3130m a year to energy prices by climate change policies that make the UK steel sector\u2019s energy costs up to double those of French and German plants,\u201d it said. \u201cAt the same time, business rates in the UK are up to 10 times higher, while new air emissions limits from the EU industrial emissions directive will add another \u00a3500m to costs by 2020.\u201d Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: \u201cIf the sector is to continue its vital role supplying the rest of manufacturing, then we simply cannot afford to stand by. Government has within its power the gift to take immediate steps which can alleviate pressure in the short term.\u201d",

Weeks after unveiling plans for a 35-metre high \u201csky pool\u201d in Battersea\u2019s Nine Elms, developers Ballymore and EcoWorld will on Thursday start selling the Wardian development in Canary Wharf. As well as the concierge service, private gym and cinema that have become standard with luxury homes, buyers of the 624 apartments in the two new towers will have their own \u201csky garden\u201d, the largest of which will measure 37.2 sq m. Named after the Wardian case, a sealable glass container designed for growing or exporting plants, the Wardian towers will be full of foliage, from sunken gardens outside the lobby to exotic plants in the rooftop bar. Even the 25-metre open air swimming pool will be \u201cset within a flourishing tropical environment\u201d. The two towers, one 50 storeys high and the other 55, were approved by Tower Hamlets council last year and are expected to be completed in 2019. Prices begin at \u00a3395,000 for a studio and \u00a3525,000 for a one-bedroom flat, while the penthouses will be on sale at \u00a32m. The area is popular with overseas investors, and although the properties will not be sold abroad until next weekend, marketing has already begun in Kuala Lumpur. Huw Morgan from Camlins, the landscape architect that worked on the project, said: \u201cGreen space is one of the most sought-after commodities in London and Wardian London capitalises on this with abundant planting of more than a hundred different exotic species of plants and flowers across the development.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Volkswagen has quit the car firm, insisting he was not involved in the emissions tests scandal that has rocked the automotive industry and could lead to one of the biggest ever legal claims. Martin Winterkorn said the German company needed a fresh start but stressed he was \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing on my part\u201d as he stepped down as boss. The resignation of Winterkorn follows five days of growing pressure on VW after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused the carmaker of using a defeat device to cheat emissions tests on diesel cars. The crisis could lead to millions of VW and Audi vehicles being recalled around the world and legal claims from motorists. Leigh Day, a UK law firm, said that if VW also manipulated tests in Europe then UK consumers could claim compensation. Boz Michalowska, a partner at Leigh Day, said: \u201cThis could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle.\u201d Almost 50 class action lawsuits have already been filed in the US and Canada by law firms including Clifford Law and Hagens Berman. German public prosecutors are also examining a collection of legal claims that have been filed by private individuals. The US Department of Justice and the New York attorney general have launched criminal investigations. VW has enlisted Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the US law firm that defended BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, to help it deal with the growing pile of investigations and lawsuits. VW has admitted that 11m cars were fitted with the defeat devices and set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to pay for the costs of the crisis. However, it also faces the prospect of fines of up to $18bn (\u00a311.8bn) from US regulators and a prolonged legal battle on multiple fronts. Almost \u20ac25bn, or a third, has been wiped off the value of VW this week, although shares in the carmaker rebounded 5% after Winterkorn\u2019s resignation. VW said in a statement on Wednesday that it has voluntarily reported itself to state prosecutors, paving the way for a criminal investigation. It has also set up a special committee to lead its own inquiry into the scandal which is likely to lead to more senior departures. The executive committee, which is made up of five board directors, said they expected \u201cfurther personnel consequences in the next days\u201d. It added: \u201cThe internal group investigations are continuing at a high tempo. All participants in these proceedings that have resulted in unmeasurable harm for Volkswagen will be subject to the full consequences.\u201d However, the committee, which includes Wolfgang Porsche, a descendant of the company\u2019s founder, insisted that Winterkorn \u201chad no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data\u201d. The committee said it had \u201ctremendous respect for his willingness to nevertheless assume responsibility\u201d and added that VW\u2019s global expansion would be \u201cinextricably linked to his name\u201d. As the carmaker seemed to be clearing the way to pin the scandal on workers below Winterkorn, Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, criticised the company\u2019s response. He wrote in the Guardian: \u201cA company which has admitted to a flagrant violation of global rules and went to such extensive lengths to hoodwink officials has bigger questions to answer than just who takes the blame. \u201cFor VW to get away with such an audacious con, proper oversight must have been lacking. \u201cFitting 11m cars with a piece of software which artificially reduces vehicle emissions during regulators\u2019 tests is not the work of a few rogue employees. That decision was taken and put into action by people of reasonable seniority. \u201cIf the board members knew what was happening, that is clearly severe \u2013 and possibly criminal \u2013 malpractice. If they didn\u2019t, then that is a dangerous failure of responsibility.\u201d VW\u2019s full board will meet on Friday to discuss Winterkorn\u2019s successor. The 20-strong board includes members of the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, union leaders, politicians from Lower Saxony, where VW is based, and representatives from Qatar, a major shareholder. VW employs more than 600,000 staff and sold than 10m cars last year. It accounts for one in four new car sales in Europe. Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, urged VW to work with German and US authorities to resolve the crisis swiftly. \u201cUltimately, this must happen quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must not allow the impression to arise that this is a problem for the whole auto industry or that it raises questions over the integrity of Volkswagen overall. The 600,000 employees of VW cannot help it that individuals carried out criminal actions on whatever scale.\u201d In his resignation statement, Winterkorn said he was shocked by events. \u201cAbove all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group,\u201d said Winterkorn, who has led the company since 2007. \u201cI am doing this in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part. \u201cVolkswagen needs a fresh start \u2013 also in terms of personnel. I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation. \u201cThe process of clarification and transparency must continue. This is the only way to win back trust. I am convinced that the Volkswagen Group and its team will overcome this grave crisis.\u201d Earlier, Prof Karel Williams of the University of Manchester business school told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the VW scandal reflected badly on Germany. \u201cGermany has been lecturing the Greeks for years on how they cheated on the budget deficit calculations and now look at this \u2013 Germany\u2019s largest company is cheating on emissions,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a crisis for the company. It is a major set of issues about ineffective regulation as in Libor.\u201d The German government is now in danger of being dragged into the scandal after admitting that it already knew about defeat devices that could cheat emissions tests. Written responses from the transport ministry to questions from the Green party in July show the government was aware of the devices. However, the transport ministry said it had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the devices actually being used, and there was no mention of VW. Oliver Krischer, the deputy leader of the Green party, told German television that this showed the government knew that car makers were trying to manipulate emissions tests. He said: \u201cThe government worked together with the auto industry, not to ensure that the emissions levels were reduced, but so that the measuring system was set up in such a way that on paper the cars met the necessary standards.\u201d However, Alexander Dobrindt, the transport minister, dismissed the claims as \u201cfalse and inappropriate\u201d. Rival carmakers have insisted that VW is an isolated case and that there is no evidence that the scandal spreads beyond the German company. The European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) said European rules will soon require testing to be conducted in realistic driving conditions as well as in laboratories, creating the strictest regime in the world. It said: \u201cThe ACEA will continue to engage with the European commission and national governments to address the current challenges and ensure that trust and confidence in the car industry and clean diesel technology are maintained.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Martin Winterkorn\u2019s resignation as chief executive of Volkswagen arrived five days too late. It should have been obvious to the entire board, not only to Winterkorn himself, that the boss could not survive the emissions scandal that broke last Friday. Winterkorn says he is \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing on my part\u201d, but the buck always stops with the boss. Wednesday\u2019s statement tried to promote the impression of dynamism within Volkswagen\u2019s boardroom. Further \u201cpersonnel consequences\u201d are expected in the next few days; a criminal complaint has been filed with prosecutors in the local state of Lower Saxony; wrongdoers will face \u201cthe full consequences\u201d. Yet the longest of the nine paragraphs was a flowery tribute to Winterkorn\u2019s career at Volkswagen. He made \u201cinvaluable\u201d and \u201ctowering\u201d contributions and the carmaker\u2019s rise to global status is \u201cinextricably linked to his name\u201d. His willingness to resign is \u201cillustrious\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s how they talk in German boardrooms. But come on, Volkswagen\u2019s long-term survival as an independent company is in doubt if this scandal turns much uglier. This was not a moment to pretend that the fallen chief executive, one of Europe\u2019s highest-paid executives, is still a hero \u2013 the catastrophe happened on his watch. What about iron, chancellor? How splendid: the chancellor is giving \u00a33m of our money to a Premier League scheme to train 5,000 football coaches in China. Why the Chinese \u2013 or even the cash-bloated Premier League \u2013 can\u2019t pay the bill themselves is unexplained. Not for the first time this week, George Osborne invites us to celebrate an example of the UK working with China \u201cto benefit both our nations\u201d. Tell it to the UK\u2019s steelmakers. They will gather in London today to lobby the government for what they describe as \u201chalf a chance\u201d to compete with other steel-making nations on equal terms. The threat to the huge Thai-owned plant in Redcar adds urgency to the cries, but the plea is made of behalf of the whole of a UK industry that still employs 30,000 people. The chancellor\u2019s current love-in with China should add spice to the occasion. Many forces are undermining the economics of the steel industry in the UK, but the biggest is not in doubt: the dumping of excess output on world markets by Chinese producers. There is little UK Steel can do on that front other than try to stiffen the government\u2019s (sometimes wobbly) support for EU anti-dumping measures. But Osborne and co could certainly act on the industry\u2019s other requests, such as speeding up relief from environmental costs for energy-intensive industries. France and Germany appear to have acted far faster. As for supporting local steel content in major construction projects, why not? China wouldn\u2019t hesitate to favour its own. BBA Aviation reaches for the sky Here\u2019s a refreshing throwback: a UK company buying a US rival and funding the deal via the old-fashioned means of a rights issue. It\u2019s how capital markets used to work before share buybacks became an obsession in UK boardrooms. The buyer is BBA Aviation, until Wednesday one of the lower-profile FTSE 250 companies. Its business is refuelling and servicing corporate jets, mostly on small US airports. It is number one in its field in the US already and is buying the third largest operator, Landmark Aviation, for $2bn (\u00a31.3bn), funded via a \u00a3750m right issue and a large helping of debt. It\u2019s a substantial bet given that BBA itself is worth only \u00a31.3bn. Nor can the deal be described as cheap: it is only by making a series of assumptions about tax and cost savings that the price tag falls below 10 times Landmark\u2019s top-line earnings. Note, too, the seller: private equity firm Carlyle, not an outfit renowned for leaving much fat to be trimmed. Yet BBA\u2019s share price reversed its big opening fall to end marginally higher on the day, demonstrating that shareholders are convinced. On balance, one can understand why. Use of corporate jets is so ingrained in US corporate culture that the market should continue to be stable. Leadership is probably worth paying up for. The financial arithmetic is bold \u2013 BBA\u2019s debt will rise initially to 3.5 times top-line earnings \u2013 but not off the radar. And, for BBA chairman Sir Nigel Rudd \u2013 traditionally typecast as an inveterate seller of businesses from Pilkington to Boots \u2013 it is an opportunity to show that the caricature was unfair. London flies finance flag So much for the idea that London\u2019s standing as a financial centre would be undermined by bank-bashers, meddling eurocrats, homegrown regulators, Scottish nationalists, UKippers, or any number of supposed perils. London has once again overtaken New York as the world\u2019s top financial centre, according to a survey that samples the opinions of local professionals. There\u2019s no room for complacency, City lobbyists will no doubt argue. Well, yes, complacency is rarely a good policy, and, at a push, it might be argued that the looming referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU represents the next danger. Even so, London is so far ahead of its European rivals (Frankfurt is 14th in the rankings) that one strongly suspects that, one way or another, the London-New York axis will continue to dominate.",

After the second world war, the British army, led by Maj Ivan Hirst, decided to try to salvage the carmaker\u2019s factory in Wolfsburg rather than destroy it.

By 1972, the Beetle had overtaken the Model-T to become the bestselling car of all time and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vw-volkswagen\">VW</a> was leading the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d in west Germany.

Hitler named the car the KdF-Wagen, with KdF standing for \u201cstrength through joy\u201d. However, the public referred to it as the Volkswagen, which literally means \u201cthe people\u2019s car\u201d.</p> <p>A deal was agreed after the second world war whereby Porsche\u2019s design company, which would eventually become Porsche itself, was paid a licensing fee by VW for use of the Beetle. The split between Porsche and VW would come to epitomise a split within the descendants of Ferdinand Porsche \u2013 the Porsche and the Pi\u00ebch families.</p> <p>Prof Garel Rhys,from the Cardiff Business School and a leading UK expert on the industry, said: \u201cIt has always been a problem for the board that Volkswagen is psychologically nationalised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [Germany] feels it is part of German state and too big to fail.\u201d</p> <p>This is reflected by the makeup of the VW board.

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen could easily have ended up a British company. After the second world war, the British army, led by Maj Ivan Hirst, decided to try to salvage the carmaker\u2019s factory in Wolfsburg rather than destroy it. They instructed VW to construct 20,000 cars to help the army travel around the British occupation zone, of which Wolfsburg was part. The factory was then offered to Britain as war reparations. However, a delegation led by Sir William Rootes \u2013 later Lord Rootes and head of the carmaker Rootes \u2013 decided that VW was not worth the money. He is purported to have said that the Beetle was \u201ctoo ugly and too noisy\u201d. That turned out to be a costly error. By 1972, the Beetle had overtaken the Model-T to become the bestselling car of all time and VW was leading the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d in west Germany. Today, including commercial vehicles, the company is the biggest vehicle manufacturer in the world and accounts for one in four of all cars sold in Europe. The history of VW helps to explain the major impact the emissions scandal has had in Germany \u2013 and also the dramatic clashes in the company\u2019s boardroom. VW was created when Adolf Hitler commissioned Ferdinand Porsche to follow Henry Ford\u2019s lead and design a \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d for Germany. Hitler named the car the KdF-Wagen, with KdF standing for \u201cstrength through joy\u201d. However, the public referred to it as the Volkswagen, which literally means \u201cthe people\u2019s car\u201d. A deal was agreed after the second world war whereby Porsche\u2019s design company, which would eventually become Porsche itself, was paid a licensing fee by VW for use of the Beetle. The split between Porsche and VW would come to epitomise a split within the descendants of Ferdinand Porsche \u2013 the Porsche and the Pi\u00ebch families. Prof Garel Rhys,from the Cardiff Business School and a leading UK expert on the industry, said: \u201cIt has always been a problem for the board that Volkswagen is psychologically nationalised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [Germany] feels it is part of German state and too big to fail.\u201d This is reflected by the makeup of the VW board. The management board consists of 10 VW executives, led by Martin Winterkorn until he resigned as chief executive. However, the supervisory board, which approves all key decisions, has 20 members. This includes two Qatari representatives, two from Lower Saxony \u2013 the president and labour minister \u2013 five members of the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, and 10 union representatives. Ever since the second world war, part of VW has been owned by Germany or a state. Today, Lower Saxony, where VW is based, controls 20% of the shares. Of the remaining shares, 50.73% are held by the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch family, and 17% by Qatar. Rhys described the board as unusual, adding: \u201cThere is a degree of complacency and pomposity within the company. When you have a market share that big it is difficult to keep your feet on the ground.\u201d Without the support of the supervisory board, Winterkorn could not survive as chief executive. He had only recently won a brutal power struggle with chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, grandson of Ferdinard Porsche, that might have paved the way for the creation of a more stable boardroom. Winterkorn, who became chief executive in 2007, was Pi\u00ebch\u2019s protege, but the pair fell out. Pi\u00ebch became increasingly disillusioned with VW\u2019s performance, particularly its failure to break the dominance of Ford, General Motors and Toyota in the US, and in an interview earlier this year said he had \u201cdistanced\u201d himself from Winterkorn. During Pi\u00ebch\u2019s 22 years at the top of Volkswagen, remarks such as this had been enough to account for a string of executives. \u201cWhen I have lost confidence in people, I deliberately allow them to fall by the wayside,\u201d Pi\u00ebch once said. However, at a meeting in April, the vast majority of the board, including members of the Porsche family, gave their backing to Winterkorn. This led to Pi\u00ebch and his second wife, Ursula, stepping down, ending a struggle that had captivated Germany. The clash between Winterkorn and Pi\u00ebch was also the culmination of an extraordinary battle between the Volkswagen and Porsche businesses. In 2005, Porsche began secretly buying shares in VW as part of an audacious plan to take control of a company that was 15 times larger using complex share options and financial engineering. However, when the financial crisis struck, Porsche\u2019s plan ran out of steam and it failed to win enough support from VW\u2019s shareholders. This led to VW turning the tables on Porsche and taking over the sports car maker. The deal was eventually completed in 2012 and brought the sister companies into one group. However, the takeover battle reinforced the split between the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families. It had pitted Wolfgang Porsche, the chairman of Porsche, against his older cousin Pi\u00ebch. The relationship never seems to have recovered, with Wolfgang Porsche supporting Winterkorn in the power struggle this year. However, while Winterkorn may have survived the politics of the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, the emissions crisis has now ended his tenure at what has become Germany\u2019s flagship company.",

      "bodyText": "Low-skilled migration and a reluctance to invest have been cited by a leading Bank of England official as possible factors depressing wage growth and harming Britain\u2019s productivity since the deep recession of 2008-09. Ben Broadbent, one of Threadneedle Street\u2019s four deputy governors, said the skewing of employment growth towards the lower-paid and lower-skilled helped explain why pay pressures were so weak. The Bank has been wrong-footed by the failure of wage growth to pick up despite the strong increase in employment since the economy started to pick up speed in early 2013, but Broadbent said the explanation was that the present recovery had been more biased towards low-paid jobs than the previous upturn from recession in the 1990s. \u201cDuring 2014, for example, it\u2019s the fact that new jobs went to people with below-average qualifications and experience, and in lower-paid occupations, that depressed average pay growth.\u201d Hiring had been driven by low-skilled jobs which often paid less than typical jobs before the financial crisis, pushing down on average rates of pay growth and productivity, he said. \u201cPerhaps easier immigration has made low-skilled labour easier to come by ... (and) maybe deterrents to investment in physical capital, and new technologies, have also reduced the relative demand for high-skilled labour,\u201d he said. Speaking in London, Broadbent said the marked change in the makeup of the labour market had been a factor in reducing productivity growth, reflecting a slower rate of improvement in the average \u201cquality\u201d of the workforce. He said: \u201cHuman capital, to use the economists\u2019 terminology, has been growing at a slower rate, particularly compared with the first half of the 1990s.\u201d Broadbent added that the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee had to take the changes in the composition of the workforce into account when setting interest rates. While having no direct bearing on inflation, the Bank deputy governor said shifts in the mix of employment had an impact on the indicators, such as wage growth, which were used by Theadneedle Street to measure pressures on the cost of living. \u201cIn the past two to three years in particular, the extent of the skew towards low-skilled employment helps to explain some of the weakness of average productivity and pay. Broadbent cited the example of a small business he had spoken with which hired two, less-skilled accountants \u2013 one found by advertising across Europe \u2013 rather than pay more and take longer to find a single, more experienced British employee. He added that it would be a mistake to exaggerate the impact of migration, which most economists say has benefited the economy. But Broadbent said the strength of Britain\u2019s economy compared to elsewhere in the EU had pulled in migrants, and the unwillingness of banks to lend after the financial crisis had reduced investment in productivity-boosting technology, he added. Both factors should fade in future, allowing the pickup in wages and productivity seen since the start of 2015 to gather pace, Broadbent said. \u201cA strengthening of the recovery in the rest of Europe would reduce the relative supply of low-skilled labour, and a fall in risk premia on new investment, in human as well as physical capital, would raise the demand for high skills,\u201d he said. Broadbent said the bias towards low-paid jobs helped explain why Britain had adjusted relatively easily to lower earnings growth. To the extent that the weakness in productivity \u201chas had nothing to do with existing jobs but instead reflects the skew in the creation of new jobs towards relatively less productive, less well-paid roles there would be no real-wage resistance, among existing employees, to overcome\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "By the end of June, temperatures in Washington\u2019s Yakima Valley had hovered around 100F (37.7C) for weeks. Hops \u2013 the flowering cones that give beer its bitterness \u2013 began to brown on trellises, making beer makers nervous. The state of Washington grows more than 70% of American hops. The Yakima Valley, on the east side of the Cascade Range, is usually particularly fertile. But fires, record high temperatures and a statewide drought bore down on the valley this year, making things bad for hops. In May, the Bureau of Reclamation forecasted that the Yakima River Basin would see just 44% of its average summer capacity. Water districts in the region initiated cutbacks. The Roza Irrigation District shut off water completely for three weeks in May, to protect later crops, while the Wapato district elected to limit watering to certain days. Ann George, the executive director of the Washington Hops Commission says the restrictions were particularly hard for perennials like hops, which need constant hydration. Breeding and buying hops is a form of predicting the future. It takes three years for a new variety to become commercially viable, so both brewers and farmers are trying to gamble on what\u2019s going to be popular down the road, and make sure that they have enough of a supply to make money if nature doesn\u2019t cooperate. \u201cGrowers don\u2019t grow crops unless they have a contract, so pretty much everything is in contract three to five years out,\u201d George says. Now, in harvest season of what\u2019s expected to be the the hottest year on record , growers are trying to predict what will happen if things stay hot and dry. Adam Robbings, the head brewer at Seattle-based Rubens Brews, is already thinking about how he can be flexible in the next few years. He says he doesn\u2019t expect to see a big change this year, but he\u2019s expecting a shift next year, and into the future. If the weather trends keep up, he thinks that brewers could potentially just cut back on the amount of hops they use, sacrificing quality for cost. \u201cIf you wanted to brew more volume you might reduce hops, but I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could do a 10% reduction and brew 10% more, and people probably wouldn\u2019t notice, but at some point you sit up and it\u2019s like, \u2018Damn, this doesn\u2019t taste like it should\u2019.\u201d Robbings says the local brewery scene is small enough that sometimes he can barter with other breweries for specific hops varieties, but that he thinks he\u2019ll be more likely to edit his recipes and steer away from hop-heavy beers like IPAs if his hop suppliers fail to produce. \u201c70% of craft beers are IPAs, and people expect a certain taste, so I over-contract to make sure that we have that. If it doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be forced to innovate, maybe put a pilsner on the lineup, maybe try to get a guava flavor profile for the IPA from the actual fruit instead of the hops, or use hops that have been out of fashion.\u201d It\u2019s not just the Seattle beer scene that will be impacted. Yakima pumps hops out to the US and the rest of the world, so the craft beer industry is heavily influenced by what happens in Washington. Robbings says the lack of hops could mean the bursting of an industry-wide bubble. \u201cThe industry is running at 18% growth right now, so obviously it has to slow down at some point,\u201d he says. That bubble is highly dependent on El Ni\u00f1o. \u201c The $64m dollar question is what happens next year,\u201d George says. \u201cWe\u2019re coming into the winter with empty reservoirs.\u201d Commercial hops are the female end of a slow-to-mature perennial rhizome that needs significant water to grow. Each plant takes about three gallons a day, and they\u2019re picky about sunshine and temperatures \u2013 the daylight changes at the summer solstice trigger their growth cycles. When highs top 100F (37.7C), it hampers their development. \u201cIn some varieties, the cones just stopped growing,\u201d says Taylor Swofford, of Hops Direct, a fourth-generation hops grower in Puterbaugh Farms. It seems the yields that farmers are collecting now are on par with the past few years \u2013 but they look different. The aroma hops varieties \u2013 the piney fruity varieties that give your IPA its kick \u2013 are particularly sensitive to heat, and they\u2019re also becoming increasingly popular. \u201cWe had a substantial increase in acreage,\u201d George says. \u201cWe had some reduced yield but we still expect to harvest more hops than last year.\u201d Steve Carpenter, president and CEO of hops merchant Yakima Chief-Hopunion, says growers dodged a bullet, considering the dire water situation. Centennial yields are down, he says, but Cascade hops are above average. The big change is going to be in the variety of hops available, and if climate patterns continue, the yields could likely drop off, too, driving up the price. That\u2019s already started, and it\u2019s been compounded by the increased interest from craft brewers in rarer varieties of hops. \u201cIn the last five years, the US has gone from growing 70% alpha hops to 70% aroma because of brewery demand,\u201d George says. Because popular aroma hop varieties are younger, however, they\u2019re often less hardy, meaning they are more vulnerable to weather and water variability. Swofford says the availability of different varieties means that brewers and drinkers are going to have to get creative. \u201cRecipes may have to change in terms of what varieties they use. One variety with similar qualities could be switched for the one that is unfortunately low in availability,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could potentially mean higher prices for beer drinkers,\u201d Swofford says. \u201cWe cannot confirm that, of course, but we predict that consumers will need to be flexible when searching for craft beers.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>By the end of June, temperatures in Washington\u2019s Yakima Valley had hovered around 100F (37.7C) for weeks. Hops \u2013 the flowering cones that give beer its bitterness \u2013 began to brown on trellises, making beer makers nervous.</p> <p>The state of Washington grows more than 70% of American hops. The Yakima Valley, on the east side of the Cascade Range, is usually particularly fertile. But fires, record high temperatures and a statewide drought bore down on the valley this year, making things bad for hops. In May, the Bureau of Reclamation forecasted that the Yakima River Basin would see just 44% of its average summer capacity. Water districts in the region initiated cutbacks. The Roza Irrigation District shut off water completely for three weeks in May, to protect later crops, while the Wapato district elected to limit watering to certain days. Ann George, the executive director of the Washington Hops Commission says the restrictions were particularly hard for perennials like hops, which need constant hydration.</p> <p>Breeding and buying hops is a form of predicting the future. It takes three years for a new variety to become commercially viable, so both brewers and farmers are trying to gamble on what\u2019s going to be popular down the road, and make sure that they have enough of a supply to make money if nature doesn\u2019t cooperate. </p> <p>\u201cGrowers don\u2019t grow crops unless they have a contract, so pretty much everything is in contract three to five years out,\u201d George says.</p> <p>Now, in harvest season of what\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/21/climate-scientists-say-2015-on-track-to-be-warmest-year-on-record\">expected to be the </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/21/climate-scientists-say-2015-on-track-to-be-warmest-year-on-record\">the hottest year on record</a> , growers are trying to predict what will happen if things stay hot and dry.</p> <p>Adam Robbings, the head brewer at Seattle-based Rubens Brews, is already thinking about how he can be flexible in the next few years. He says he doesn\u2019t expect to see a big change this year, but he\u2019s expecting a shift next year, and into the future. If the weather trends keep up, he thinks that brewers could potentially just cut back on the amount of hops they use, sacrificing quality for cost. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/22/high-end-beer-how-to-pair-with-food\">The brave new world of high-end beer \u2013 and how to pair it with food</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you wanted to brew more volume you might reduce hops, but I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could do a 10% reduction and brew 10% more, and people probably wouldn\u2019t notice, but at some point you sit up and it\u2019s like, \u2018Damn, this doesn\u2019t taste like it should\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Robbings says the local brewery scene is small enough that sometimes he can barter with other breweries for specific hops varieties, but that he thinks he\u2019ll be more likely to edit his recipes and steer away from hop-heavy beers like IPAs if his hop suppliers fail to produce. </p> <p>\u201c70% of craft beers are IPAs, and people expect a certain taste, so I over-contract to make sure that we have that. If it doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be forced to innovate, maybe put a pilsner on the lineup, maybe try to get a guava flavor profile for the IPA from the actual fruit instead of the hops, or use hops that have been out of fashion.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the Seattle beer scene that will be impacted. Yakima pumps hops out to the US and the rest of the world, so the craft beer industry is heavily influenced by what happens in Washington. Robbings says the lack of hops could mean the bursting of an industry-wide bubble. \u201cThe industry is running at 18% growth right now, so obviously it has to slow down at some point,\u201d he says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/el-nino-weather-save-california-destroy-tropics\">That bubble is highly dependent on El Ni\u00f1o.</a> \u201c The $64m dollar question is what happens next year,\u201d George says. \u201cWe\u2019re coming into the winter with empty reservoirs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/18/us-prepares-pope-visit-american-tour\">US makes beer, quirky merch and dire traffic predictions ahead of Pope's visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Commercial hops are the female end of a slow-to-mature perennial rhizome that needs significant water to grow.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s our latest story on the VW scandal and Winterkorn\u2019s decision to do the honourable thing: Volkswagen has announced the resignation of its chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, and said the fallout from the diesel emissions test scandal would result in further executive scalps and a likely criminal investigation in Germany. Winterkorn said on Wednesday he took full responsibility for the scandal, in which the company admitted that 11m cars were installed with a defeat device that reduced emissions under test conditions only, but he denied personal wrongdoing. The company\u2019s stock market value has fallen dramatically since the admission this week. As he resigned, Winterkorn described the situation facing the carmaker as a \u201cgrave crisis\u201d. Volkswagen faces up to \u00a312bn in fines and is the subject of multiple investigations after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused it of manipulating tests on 18 September. Its executive committee said on Wednesday that it had voluntarily submitted a complaint to the state prosecutors\u2019 office in Brunswick. \u201cIn the view of the executive committee, criminal proceedings may be relevant due to the irregularities,\u201d it said. Full story here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back to cover all the latest developments. Here\u2019s our explanation of how the defeat device worked and how VW cheated in emissions tests: This is not the first time Volkswagen has run foul of US authorities over pollution controls, CNBC is reporting: Volkswagen has had a previous run-in with U.S. authorities for selling vehicles that used so-called \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to disable pollution-control systems in four models of its vehicles produced in 1973. News reports archived by the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety show the German automaker, then known as Volkswagenwerk AG, and its American subsidiary, Volkswagen of America, paid a $120,000 fine in March 1974 to settle a complaint filed by the Environmental Protection Agency over the use of so-called \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that disabled certain pollution-control systems. The complaint said the use of the devices violated the U.S. Clean Air Act. Don\u2019t question all diesel technology or the whole German motor industry because of the VW scandal, is the plea from the country\u2019s VDA auto industry association. Reuters reports: The head of VDA warned on Wednesday against calling into question all diesel technology because of the crisis at Volkswagen. \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of using this case where software was manipulated to produce better test results to call into question all diesel technology,\u201d VDA chief Matthias Wissmann said. \u201cThe diesel that is used by the German auto industry in many configurations is a major driver of the reduction in CO2 emissions worldwide. Therefore we need a clear separation here,\u201d he added. \u201cMy plea is, no general suspicion towards the German auto industry.\u201d Here\u2019s the view of one of Volkswagen\u2019s biggest shareholders on the scandal. The BBC has spoken to AXA fund manager Gilles Guibout about Winterkorn\u2019s resignation and the accusations against the company: There was no alternative - it is an attempt to keep the fire under control. He has tried to take all the responsibility but it is not easy to say if this will be enough. [The allegations have] been a real shock. We are a long term shareholder and we put a lot of emphasis on management credibility. The fall in the share price was too big for us to sell - it would not be in our clients\u2019 interest to sell. Volkswagen shares recovered some of the losses they have sustained since the emissions scandal broke at the start of the week. They closed 5.19% higher at \u20ac111.5, but the company has still lost around \u20ac26bn of value following the crisis. Overall European markets have - mostly - regained some ground, helped by the rebound in VW and comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that the bank was ready to adjust its QE programme if necessary in the light of economic circumstances. He told the European parliament: The asset purchase programme has sufficient in-built flexibility. We will adjust its size, composition and duration as appropriate, if more monetary policy impulse should become necessary. With a rebound in commodity prices despite yet more weak Chinese data, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.62% or 96.4 points at 6032.24 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.44% to 9612.62 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.1% at4432.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.18% to 21,068.88 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.79% at 9474.6 In Athens the market fell 1.32% to 668.54 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit by weak US manufacturing data, which showed growth at a two year low in September, and is currently 106 points or 0.6% lower. Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board has admitted criminal charges could follow after the revelation of the emissions scandal, and it has called in the state prosecutor. As mentioned earlier it plans to set up a task force to investigate what happened, with external advisors. It also thanked Martin Winterkorn for his \u201cinvaluable contributions\u201d to VW and noted he had no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data. And it warned anyone found to have committed wrongdoing would face the consequences. Here is the full statement: 1. The Executive Committee takes this matter extremely seriously. The Executive Committee recognizes not only the economic damage caused, but also the loss of trust among many customers worldwide. 2. The Executive Committee agrees that these incidents need to be clarified with great conviction and that mistakes are corrected. At the same time, the Executive Committee is adamant that it will take the necessary decisive steps to ensure a credible new beginning. 3. The Executive Committee has great respect for Chairman Professor Dr. Winterkorn\u2019s offer to resign his position and to ask that his employment agreement be terminated. The Executive Committee notes that Professor Dr. Winterkorn had no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data. The Executive Committee has tremendous respect for his willingness to nevertheless assume responsibility and, in so doing, to send a strong signal both internally and externally. Dr. Winterkorn has made invaluable contributions to Volkswagen. The company\u2019s rise to global company is inextricably linked to his name. The Executive Committee thanks Dr. Winterkorn for towering contributions in the past decades and for his willingness to take responsibility in this criticall phase for the company. This attitude is illustrious. 4. Recommendations for new personnel will be presented at the upcoming meeting of the Supervisory Board this Friday. 5. The Executive Committee is expecting further personnel consequences in the next days. The internal Group investigations are continuing at a high tempo. All participants in these proceedings that has resulted in unmeasurable harm for Volkswagen, will be subject to the full consequences. 6. The Executive Committee have decided that the company will voluntarily submit a complaint to the State Prosecutors\u2019 office in Brunswick. In the view of the Executive Committee criminal proceedings may be relevant due to the irregularities. The investigations of the State Prosecutor will be supported in all form from the side of Volkswagen. 7. The Executive Committee proposes that the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG create a special committee, under whose leadership further clarifying steps will follow, including the preparation of the necessary consequences. In this regard, the Special Committee would make use of external advice. Further details about this will be decided at the Supervisory Board meeting on Friday. 8. The Executive Committee is aware that coming to terms with the crisis of trust will be a long term task that requires a high degree of consistency and thoroughness. 9. The Executive Committee will work on these tasks together with the employees and the Management Board. Volkswagen is a magnificent company that depends on the efforts of hundreds of thousands of people. We consider it our task that this company regains the trust of our customers in every respect. Martin Winterkorn had no choice but to go following the discovery of the emissions scandal, says Karl Brauer at auto industry analyst Kelley Blue Book: With more than 20 years at Volkswagen AG, during which he rapidly rose through the ranks to lead the automaker, Winterkorn appeared ready to bask in the glory of seeing VW become the world\u2019s largest automaker. But VW\u2019s intentional, widespread efforts to deceive regulators across the globe suggests a dark side to the company\u2019s growth. This activity has been going on for years, meaning Winterkorn either had full knowledge of the deception, and approved it, or he was negligent in uncovering and stopping it. Either situation reflects poorly on Winterkorn and his leadership skills, and given the tragic impact this scandal will have on VW, his resignation wasn\u2019t just likely, but necessary. Volkswagen says it will create a task force with an external advisor to look into the emissions scandal. Further heads are likely to roll after Martin Winterkorn\u2019s resignation, with more news expected after Friday\u2019s board meeting. No word either on any compensation for Winterkorn. Which if it happens is likely be be controversial, to say the least. No news yet on a successor to Winterkorn, although reports on Tuesday suggested he could be replaced by Matthias M\u00fcller, the current chief executive of Porsche. This was denied at the time. Volkswagen shares have reacted favourably to the news of Winterkorn\u2019s departure, with investors perhaps sensing there could indeed now be a fresh start as he suggested. Up around 5% before the news, they now stand 8.35% higher at \u20ac114. The news of Winterkorn\u2019s resignation comes a day after he vowed to stay on and repair the damage from the emissions scandal which has rocked the company and the motor industry. A meeting of the supervisory board today seems to have sealed his fate. It\u2019s hard to know which would have been worse: him knowing about the falsification of emission tests, or him not knowing. Here\u2019s the full statement from WInterkorn: \u201cI am shocked by the events of the past few days. Above all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group. As CEO I accept responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines and have therefore requested the Supervisory Board to agree on terminating my function as CEO of the Volkswagen Group. I am doing this in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part. Volkswagen needs a fresh start - also in terms of personnel. I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation. I have always been driven by my desire to serve this company, especially our customers and employees. Volkswagen has been, is and will always be my life. The process of clarification and transparency must continue. This is the only way to win back trust. I am convinced that the Volkswagen Group and its team will overcome this grave crisis.\u201d VW chief executive Martin WInterkorn has resigned over the emissions scandal. BREAKING NEWS Volkswagen will reportedly hold a press event. shortly. An earlier tweet suggesting the event was in London has been deleted. More fallout from the VW scandal: platinum has dropped to a six and a half year low. The metal is used in diesel catalysts to clean up emissions, but obviously with the VW crisis, there could be less demand in future for diesel cars. It fell as low as $925.3 an ounce - its lowest since January 2009 - before recovering to $930.5, down 0.6%. Fitch does makes some serious points about Volkswagen\u2019s crisis, as it puts the company on rating watch negative - the first step to a downgrade. It says the rating action reflects the damage on its reputation following alleged manipulation of emission tests A decision on whether to downgrade VW will be made when there is more clarity about the magnitude and timeframe of the costs, and the impact on regulators and consumers worldwide It expects VW\u2019s brand image and reputation with regulators and consumers worldwide to be seriously undermined by crisis It expects total cash outflows to be several billions euros over the next two years Quick out of the blocks as ever, rating agency Fitch has just concluded that it might cut Volkswagen\u2019s credit rating over this scandal. Volkswagen could face one of the biggest legal claims from UK consumers ever, say lawyers. Boz Michelowska, a partner and consumer goods expert at law firm Leigh Day, believes legal cases could be brought in Britain if VW vehicles here were able to bypass the European emissions tests. Michelowska explains: \u201cIf it is shown that this piece of software defeated the European testing then Volkswagen would be in a very similar position as in the US and may well then have to call in their cars with all the resulting costs involved. \u201cThis could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle.\u201d Importantly, the new Consumer Rights Act, which comes into force in October, will allow consumers to band together in \u2018collective actions\u2019 against companies. Eleven million VW cars with \u2018defeat devices\u2019 were sold worldwide, so it is likely that a significant number were bought by UK drivers. And anyone who owns a VW diesel could suffer financially from this crisis. The resale value of their vehicles is unlikely to have risen, after all. There\u2019s not much precedent for a claim of this type. Leigh Day suggests problems with faulty hip replacements in the UK; a serious problem, but one which only affects tens of thousands of people. Back in Germany, prosecutors have said they are conducting a preliminary investigation into Volkswagen. Reuters has the details: Prosecutors of the German state Niedersachsen said in a statement they were looking into an investigation against Volkswagen employees as they had received a number of criminal complaints from citizens. Heads-up. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is about to testify to MEPs at the European Parliament. Here\u2019s a livefeed. Draghi is unlikely to touch on the Volkswagen scandal (alas), but may make some important points about the eurozone economy, and the prospect of further stimulus measures. The damage to VW\u2019s market value this week is quite staggering: Germany\u2019s financial watchdog, Bafin, is conducting a \u2018routine\u2019 investigation into the slump in Volkswagen\u2019s shares this week. The probe will look into whether VW released market-sensitive information in a timely manner. The company\u2019s shares slid 19% on Monday, after US authorities accused it of cheating on emissions tests last Friday, and forced it to recall 482,000 cars. However it didn\u2019t announce until late Tuesday morning that 11 million vehicles were affected, triggering a second share slump. Back in Berlin, transport minister Alexander Dobrindt has denied knowing that German carmakers were rigging emission tests (as claimed earlier) He told reporters: \u201cI have made it very clear ... that the allegations of the Greens party are false and inappropriate. \u201cWe are trying to clear up this case. Volkswagen has to win back confidence.\u201d France\u2019s energy minister Segolene Royal has vowed that Paris will be \u201cextremely thorough, extremely severe\u201d line with Volkswagen. She told reporters that it was unacceptable to sell vehicles whose environmental credentials were false: The victims are workers whose situation has been made more precarious, consumers who were duped and also the state which pays subsidies for purchases of clean vehicles.\u201d The Germany government is being dragged into the VW scandal, and faces accusations that it knew that carmakers could falsify emissions data. It\u2019s emerged that the transport ministry mentioned the issue in July, in response to a question from the Green party. The Financial Times has a good take: In a written response to a question from the Green party, the German transport ministry said: \u201cThe federal government is aware of [defeat devices], which have the goal of [test] cycle detection.\u201d The Greens asked if the ministry was aware of the deployment of defeat device software in new vehicles, and it replied: \u201cWe have no knowledge of this.\u201d There was no specific question about VW and defeat device software from the Greens, and the ministry did not refer to the company. However, the ministry answered the question on July 28, prompting accusations that Berlin had been aware of the potential for cheating in the industry for months. The ministry added that it shared the European commission\u2019s view that there are \u201cno extensively proven means of preventing defeat devices\u201d. Defeat devices are the software used by VW to cut how much NOx gases were pumped out during an emissions test. The Green party now claims that Angela Merkel\u2019s government knew more than it has admitted. Oliver Krischer, Green party deputy leader, told the N24 TV station last night that: The government told us in July that it knew about this software that has been used in the USA, and they clearly knew that the software was widely in use. The government worked together with the auto industry, not to ensure that the emissions levels were reduced, but so that the measuring system was set up in such a way that on paper the cars met the necessary standards. Nobody knows how bad this crisis could become, says Saxo Bank\u2019s head of equity strategy, Peter Garnry. For a start, Volkswagen hasn\u2019t put aside enough money to cover the costs. Yesterday it announced a provision of \u20ac6.5bn, which is dwarfed by its potential fine from US regulators, which could hit $20bn. Garnry adds that this is no longer just an isolated case in the US - given this software was installed on 11m vehicles worldwide, not just half a million in America. Also, is this an issue that extends across the industry? Why should Volkswagen be the only one? If they were the only one who cheated on the emission data they would be standing out from the competition so much that everyone would be wondering, but they\u2019re not. Here\u2019s Garnry\u2019s video interview on Volkswagen. This scandal could have very serious consequences for the German city of Wolfsburg, which was created in the 1930s to build the Beetle. Bloomberg reports: \u2018If you\u2019d visualise traffic in and out of the city, it would look like a pulse and the heart is the VW plant,\u2019 cab driver Karsten Raabe says as he steers his Skoda by the sprawling complex, where hundreds of gleaming cars sit in parking lots and on the back of freight trains. \u2018Without VW, this city and the entire region would die. We\u2019d become a European Detroit,\u2019 which declared the biggest US municipal bankruptcy in 2013. The town has already taken one hammering this week; Wolfsburg was on the wrong end of a 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich last night. Some brave investors in Frankfurt are buying into Volkswagen. This has pushed its share price up around 3% today to \u20ac109, a far cry from the \u20ac162 on Friday before the emissions bombshell landed. Martin Winterkorn should do the right thing and resign now, argues our finance editor Nils Pratley. Either Winterkorn knew what was going on, or he should have done. If he knew the company had installed software to cheat US emissions tests, the end of his business career will be the least of his problems. If he didn\u2019t know, he\u2019s failed to do his job properly. Either way, he should have resigned from a well-paid post he has held since 2007. The scandal also doesn\u2019t reflect well on Germany\u2019s corporate governance, Nils adds: It\u2019s also astonishing that Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board didn\u2019t insist on an immediate resignation. If this was a UK-listed company \u2013 a leading member of the FTSE 100 index \u2013 it is safe to say the chief executive would have received his marching orders on day one. The executive committee of Volkswagen\u2019s board is meeting now to discuss the crisis that has rocked Germany\u2019s largest carmarker, according to local reports. Top of the agenda is whether to fire CEO Martin Winterkorn after the company admitted installing software to fool emissions testing in 11m cars, issued a profits warning, and set aside \u20ac6.5bn to cover the costs. The board are certain to grill Winterkorn intensively; how much did he know about the illicit code, and for how long? Winterkorn is famous in the industry for his engineering acumen. He isn\u2019t a beancounter who wouldn\u2019t have been interested in the nitty-gritty of how his cars performed, or how they managed to pass tough US emissions exams. However, the VW board could be reluctant to haul Winterkorn into the pits today, as the scandal is only just unfolding. A source familiar with the deliberations has told Reuters that the board is in a \u201ctricky situation\u201d, trying to make a decision without yet knowing the full extent of the CEO\u2019s role in the scandal. Volkswagen faces the prospect of a massive legal battle over the emissions-fixing scandal, as customers seek redress. Several legal firms have already filed class action lawsuits. The latest is Clifford Law of Chicago, who argues that consumers who bought a VW car have been shortchanged. Sky News has the details: A US law firm has begun a class action lawsuit against Volkswagen over the \u2018defeat devices\u2019 used to fool exhaust emissions tests. Robert Clifford, partner at Chicago\u2019s Clifford Law, said the impact on consumers was \u2018massive\u2019 and that car buyers had not got what they paid for. Mr Clifford said people were also affected because of \u2018diminution of value\u2019 \u2013 meaning their car could now be worth less. The law suit has been filed at a district court in northern Illinois. More here: firm launches Volkswagen emissions lawsuit Another law firm, Hagens Berman of Seattle, filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status over the weekend, shortly after VW was accused of cheating on US emission tests. A Canadian legal outfit, Sutts, Strosberg LLP of Windsor, Ontario, is seeking $1bn in damages and an additional $100m. Lawyer Harvey Strosberg told a press conference on Tuesday that any Canadian with a Volkswagen diesel car made before September 2015 can add their name to the suit. Faced with this phalanx of m\u2019learned friends, Volkswagen has hired the US law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP. Kirkland &amp; Ellis led BP\u2019s defence after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal is arguably the biggest corporate crisis since BP. The Volkswagen crisis comes at a tricky time for Europe\u2019s industry, given China\u2019s slowdown. New data released this morning shows that private sector growth across the eurozone dipped this month, with factory growth at a five-month low. More here. Australia\u2019s stock market has hit a two year-low, following the weak Chinese factory data released this morning: Volkswagen shares are pretty volatile today. They\u2019re currently flat for the day, after plunging 10% at the open. It\u2019s almost suspicious..... \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for events in a single company to become a driver of global markets but that\u2019s what is happening now with Volkswagen\u201d. So says Kit Juckes, senior strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, adding: The woes of the world\u2019s second-biggest car manufacturer are doing nothing for economic optimism or risk appetite and they are undermining the euro, against both dollar and yen. Over in Paris, shares in Renault and Peugeot have both fallen by over 5%: Volkswagen\u2019s share price fell as much 10% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, before stabilising. Investors are try to calculate the full damage that this crisis will cause to the company, ahead of today\u2019s crucial board meeting. Other car firms are being dragged down too; reflecting fears that the European auto industry will be dragged into the scandal. Volkswagen\u2019s rigging of emissions tests for 11m cars means they may be responsible for nearly 1m tonnes of air pollution every year. That\u2019s roughly the same as the UK\u2019s combined emissions for all power stations, vehicles, industry and agriculture, a Guardian analysis suggests. More here: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the UK\u2019s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), is defending the industry. He tells the Today Programme that Europe is improving its testing system; technology will soon allow cars to be tested on the road, not just in the labs. [explainer: VW used secret software to turn on its pollution control systems when the car was being tested for emission levels, but turned them off when on the road] But is there a future for diesel, given what we\u2019re now learning? Diesels continue to emit 15% fewer carbon emissions than petrol, Hawes says, and the problem of harmful particulates has been solved too. But 12,000 people a year could be dying because the car industry has not met emissions levels.... Hawes concedes that the nitrogen oxides, or NOx, gases emitted by diesel cars are a bigger problem for health than first recognised. Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC, which represents European Consumer Organisations, is discussing the crisis on the Today Programme now. How much confidence can consumers have in the car industry? This is certainly a scandal, but not a surprise to European consumer groups, Goyens says. This scandal has been allowed to happen because the entire system is flawed. There is no room for independent testing, or on-the-road testing, she explains, adding: \u201cIt does not deserve the consumer\u2019s trust if there is a cheater in the room, which there was in this case. How could this happen in Europe, though, when cars are being randomly taken off the production line and tested? Goyens explains that there is a \u201ctrend of deregulation\u201d in Europe, which limits the resources given to those who control the market -- be it for cars, food, or financial services. \u201cWhen you limit the resources to the market, you open the safety net and give more room to cheating\u201d The VW crisis is a blow to the reputation of Germany\u2019s manufacturing base. Professor Karel Williams from Manchester Business School, told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: Germany has been lecturing the Greeks for years on how they cheated on the budget deficit calculations and now look at this Germany\u2019s largest company is cheating on emissions. It\u2019s not just a crisis for the company\u2026 it is a major set of issues about ineffective regulation as in Libor\u2026 and all the rest of that. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank has just cut its recommendation on Volkswagen from \u2018buy\u2019 to \u2018hold\u2019, and slashed its earnings forecasts by up to 35%. Deutsche also warned that the full magnitude of the scandal can\u2019t be calculated yet. The legal fees will be \u201cvery painful\u201d but manageable, it says. The impact on VW\u2019s operations, though, could be even tougher. Deutsche has also cut its forecasts for German\u2019s DAX index, which is heavy with auto companies (VW, BMW, Daimler....) Over in Shanghai, the main Chinese stock market has closed 2% lower after today\u2019s weaker-than-feared factory data. The news that manufacturing output is falling at the fastest rate since 2009 (see here) spooked traders, and alarmed analysts. HSBC economist Frederic Neumann warned: New export orders have really collapsed. It means global trade is facing headwinds, and even China can\u2019t escape that It\u2019s not so bad that we need to hit the alarm button, but the decline in the economy is evident. This breakdown of today\u2019s PMI report confirms that the Chinese factory sector is deteriorating: You know your company is facing a crisis when its woes are splashed across the front pages of Britain\u2019s newspapers: Guardian: VW chief Martin Winterkorn defiant over emissions cheating scandal Telegraph: Millions of petrol cars could also be rigged in scandal FT: Volkswagen shares tumble as inquiries are launched worldwide The Times: Volkswagen in meltdown after faked diesel tests Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn\u2019s fate could be decided today, as the company\u2019s board meets to discuss the crisis. There are reports that the board began meeting last night, earlier than planned, after chancellor Angela Merkel insisted on \u2018full transparency\u2019 into the crisis. The board will surely demand to know how much Winterkorn knew about VW\u2019s illicit scheme, which used software to detect when a car was being tested and secretly cut its emissions. Bloomberg has some more detail: The 68-year-old CEO\u2019s survival hangs on convincing a few key power players, including Wolfgang Porsche, head of the family that controls a majority of VW\u2019s voting shares; Bernd Osterloh, VW\u2019s influential labor leader; and Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, which has special blocking rights at the company. All three are on the committee, which is set to vote on his future. Traders in Frankfurt are predicting that Volkswagen\u2019s share price will fall again today, when the market opens in around 20 minutes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two stories are going to dominate today. The unfolding crisis at German carmaker Volkswagen, and fresh fears over China\u2019s economy after more weak economic data overnight. VW\u2019s board are to meet today, with the future of the company in serious doubt after it admitted installing software in 11 million diesel-powered cars to cheat emissions tests. Overnight, the New York attorney general announced that his office will join the string of investigations into VW, whose share price has crumbled by a third in two days. CEO Martin Winterkorn is now fighting for his job, after apologising to customers and the authorities yesterday. And with Angela Merkel pushing for answers, and the UK demanding a EU-wide inquiry, the crisis has much further to run. Europe is also bracing for the impact of China\u2019s slowing economy, after factory output across the country fell at the fastest rate since the financial crisis The preliminary Caixin China PMI dropped to 47.0 in September, from 47.3 in August. That\u2019s the weakest reading since March 2009. Any number below 50 shows a contraction, so this fuels more fears of a Chinese hard landing.

      "bodyText": "Pest control has, perhaps not surprisingly, long been a male-dominated field. But the industry is taking steps to make sure that dealing with creepy crawlies isn\u2019t just a man\u2019s job. Insight Pest Solutions, a 100-employee pest control business in New Jersey, surveyed women in the industry to learn more about their challenges and triumphs. The survey, released this month, included personal stories that highlight the gender biases and physical challenges, as well as the benefits \u2013 like flexible work hours \u2013 that are helping to attract more women to the field. Unusually, the survey went beyond numbers to capture some of the complexity of attracting and retaining women in pest control. Most of the women surveyed said they are feeling more welcome in the pest control and entomology business, and felt the field offered good career opportunities. \u201c[It\u2019s] a very stable and flexible industry, and I imagine that more and more women are finding this field to be an attractive option in order to juggle a career and family,\u201d said Nancy Troyano, an entomologist and director of technical education and training at pest control giant Rentokil North America, who didn\u2019t participate in the survey. But the field still presents serious challenges to some women, the survey found. Lydia Brown, who works at the Maricopa Agricultural Centerat the University of Arizona, said her physical appearance sometimes draws offensive comments on the job. \u201cI receive comments on how \u2018hot\u2019 I am and questions about whether I\u2019m strong enough to handle the labor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt threatened on a few occasions while working offsite at commercial farms.\u201d But she said sexist comments are becoming rarer. Kirstin Willardson, a pest technician, said her customers are generally surprised when she arrives at a job. \u201cI think they wonder if I\u2019m as knowledgeable as the men technicians and physically competent,\u201d she said. Survey respondents also said they had to face unwelcoming male colleagues. Danesha Seth Carley, co-director of the Southern Integrated Pest Management Center, said the field is still dominated by older men. \u201cThey are not always very accepting of women, especially younger ones,\u201d she said. There\u2019s no question the field of pest control has been Y-chromosome heavy. According to the US Department of Labor, of the roughly 68,000 pest control workers in 2014, only 3.7% were women. The department expects employment of pest control technicians to grow by 20% over the next decade, faster than the average for all occupations. Troyano said that most women don\u2019t even realize that a career in pest control or entomology is an option. \u201cThe pest management industry is wide open to women, offering careers not only as pest control or service technicians, but also in sales and as customer service representatives,\u201d she said. Now, Troyano has started seeing more women enter the field. She said she is seeing more women in her training classes each year, and that switch has coincided with major changes in pest control training programs over the past couple of decades. In the past, pest control technicians, who were more often called exterminators, tended to treat each pest problem in the same way \u2013 by spraying large amounts of pesticides. But that started to change as awareness grew about the negative health and environmental effects of these chemicals. The industry has since developed more sophisticated techniques that focus on reducing the amount of pesticides used . Newer methods include using the pests\u2019 predators, placing baits only in places with concentrated pest populations or planting bug-resistant plants. As a result, more training and education is generally needed to enter the profession. \u201cPest management is very much a science, requiring trained professionals with varying levels of education, all the way up to degreed entomologists,\u201d Troyano said. \u201cSo more women are getting exposed to the pest management industry through their schooling, myself included.\u201d The Insight Pest Solutions survey polled 30 women working at all levels in the industry, including managers, entomology professors, CEOs and business owners. Of those, 24 said they felt the industry has become more welcoming to women since they started their careers, while 93% said that pest management was a good industry for women. More than half said a pest control company would be wise to have a female in upper management. Many of the women surveyed said their gender and the skills they bring had earned them respect and trust from clients, many of whom are also women. \u201cWomen come off as more nurturing and trustworthy at the door when one-on-one and face-to-face with the customer,\u201d said Micki Tolentino, a corporate training administrator at Insight Pest Solutions. \u201cI have put at ease many stay-at-home moms who request an interior service because of my gender.\u201d Kim Kelley-Tunis, technical service director at pest control company Rollins, said that women often connect more easily with clients. \u201cPest control is a customer driven industry that is dependent on communication and relationships,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen tend to be better communicators and relationship builders.\u201d Others said customers admire women who tread fearlessly into a terrain traditionally occupied by men. \u201cI often hear people say, \u2018I could never do your job\u2019, which leads me to believe they like the bravery of a woman working in the pest industry,\u201d said Jennifer Gaddis, corporate commercial account executive representative at Action Pest Control. \u201cPeople ultimately choose to do business with people they like and trust.\u201d Women certainly aren\u2019t new to the field of bugs. In the 1800s, conservationist Anna Botsford Comstock pioneered the nature study movement, advocating for hands-on learning in the natural world. Then there was Edith Patch, who, in 1930, became the first female president of the Entomology Society of America. Troyano said the industry could attract yet more women by emphasizing the flexibility of the job. \u201cMost pest management professionals have flexibility with scheduling their services,\u201d she said. \u201cThis flexibility allows women to balance career and family.\u201d Make no mistake, though, a career in bugs can be demanding. Workers often put in nights and weekends, which can make finding work-life balance a challenge. A number of the survey respondents spoke about the \u201coverwhelming\u201d workload and long hours. Jobs dealing with extermination can also be physically demanding, and workers often have to crawl or climb into tight spaces. But Troyano said these challenges shouldn\u2019t put a woman off pursuing a career in pest control. \u201cThe truth is that there are techniques to help you handle ladders as well as to meet any other occasional demand that may require physical strength, so females are just as capable of doing the job as males,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the truth is, having mental strength is far more important than physical strength \u2013 it\u2019s really about outsmarting the pest.\u201d",

A number of the survey respondents spoke about the \u201coverwhelming\u201d workload and long hours.</p> <p> Jobs dealing with extermination can also be physically demanding, and workers often have to crawl or climb into tight spaces.</p> <p> But Troyano said these challenges shouldn\u2019t put a woman off pursuing a career in pest control.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is that there are techniques to help you handle ladders as well as to meet any other occasional demand that may require physical strength, so females are just as capable of doing the job as males,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the truth is, having mental strength is far more important than physical strength \u2013 it\u2019s really about outsmarting the pest.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Happy Birthday, possibly the world\u2019s most popular song since a version was first sung in a Kentucky kindergarten more than a century ago, is finally free from copyright after a fiercely contested court battle. The song is believed to have been composed by a teacher, Patty Hill, with her sister Mildred, a pianist, and sung as Good Morning to All by children sometime before 1893. The decision by a judge in Los Angeles that the lyrics are in the public domain could now cost Warner/Chappell Music Inc, the publishing company, millions in lost royalties. A US district judge, George H King, ruled that copyright \u2013 obtained from the Hills by Clayton F Summy Co in 1935, later acquired by Birch Tree Group and then bought by Warner/Chappell, a division of Warner Group, in 1988 \u2013 only covered specific piano arrangements of the melody and not its lyrics. The legal action was brought by the makers of a documentary about the history of the song. They also argued the music publishers should be compelled to return the \u201cmillions of dollars of unlawful licensing fees\u201d collected over years. It is claimed the song makes Warner/Chappell about \u00a32m a year. \u201cHappy Birthday is finally free after 80 years. Finally, the charade is over. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Randall Newman, a lawyer for the complainants. The long and legally tortuous history of the song began in the late 19th century when the Hills wrote Good Morning to All as \u201ca song that even the youngest children could learn with perfect ease\u201d, with Mildred composing the music, and Patty the lyrics: \u201cGood morning to you, Good morning to you, Good morning dear children, Good morning to all\u201d. They later assigned their rights to Summy Co and it was published in a songbook called Song Stories for the Kindergarten. The origins of the lyrics to Happy Birthday, however, were less clear and, although sung to the same melody, may not have even been written by the Hills, the court heard. References to a Happy Birthday song first appeared in 1901, in the Inland Educator and Indiana School journal, but no lyrics. The full lyrics, as they are known today, first appeared in a 1911 book entitled The Elementary Worker and his Work, which mentioned it shared the same melody as the Good Morning song. This and another publication of the lyrics in Harvest Hymns in 1924 were registered for copyright by at least two other authors, not the Hills. In the 1930s, Happy Birthday appeared in a series of films, including Girls About Town, Bosko\u2019s Party and The Old Homestead. By now it was extremely popular, and in 1933 it was performed publicly in a play entitled As Thousands Cheer. The Hill family sued for breach of copyright as a result of the play \u2013 but over the melody not the words, the court heard. A Time magazine report at the time stated: \u201cLyricist Patty Hill, who will share the damages, if any, had no complaint to make on the use of the words because she long ago resigned herself to the fact that her ditty had become common property of the nation.\u201d Patty claimed she wrote the lyrics to Happy Birthday around the time Good Morning was created. But she had no proof, the court ruled, and her 1935 claim to authorship \u2013 some 40 years later \u2013 could have been \u201ca post-hoc attempt to take credit for the words that had long since become more famous and popular than the ones she wrote for the classic melody\u201d. The judge ruled there was no evidence Summy Co \u2013 who had sold rights to the song to film and stage producers \u2013 had ever obtained the rights over the lyrics from the Hills. An agreement between him and the Hill family examined by the court found it described the agreement as transferring right in \u201cpiano arrangements\u201d . \u201cObviously, pianos do not sing. Thus, it is not logical to infer the rights to \u2018piano arrangements\u2019 would include rights to any lyrics or words,\u201d said King. He said it was not clear whether Patty wrote the lyrics, but even if she did, neither she nor her family \u201cever did anything with their common law rights in the lyrics\u201d. \u201cThey did not take legal action to prevent the use of the lyrics by others, even as Happy Birthday became very popular and commercially valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 1934, four decades after Patty supposedly wrote the song, they finally asserted their rights to the Happy Birthday/Good Morning melody \u2013 but still made no claim to the lyrics.\u201d He concluded the Hill sisters gave Summy Co the rights to the melody and piano arrangements based on the melody \u201cbut never any rights to the lyrics\u201d. Warner/Chappell, which said it only collects royalties from those using the song in a commercial enterprise, said: \u201cWe are looking at the court\u2019s lengthy opinion and considering our options.\u201d The lawsuit was filed two years ago by Good Morning to You Productions Corp, who are working on the documentary about the song\u2019s history.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has hired the US law firm that defended BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster to help it deal with a growing collection of investigations and law suits over the emissions scandal that has rocked the car maker and dragged in the German government. The hiring of Kirkland &amp; Ellis emerged as the German government admitted that it already knew about \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that can cheat emissions tests. Written responses from the transport ministry to questions from the Green party in July show the government was aware of the so-called defeat devices. However, the transport ministry said it had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the devices actually being used, and there was no mention of VW. Oliver Krischer, the deputy leader of the Green party, told German television that this showed the government knew that car makers were trying to manipulate emissions tests. He said: \u201cThe government worked together with the auto industry, not to ensure that the emissions levels were reduced, but so that the measuring system was set up in such a way that on paper the cars met the necessary standards.\u201d However, Alexander Dobrindt, the transport minister, dismissed the claims as \u201cfalse and inappropriate\u201d. VW has admitted that 11m of its cars worldwide were designed to cheat emissions testing and put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) to deal with the potential costs of the crisis. However, it could still face fines of up to $18bn in a criminal investigation in the US, as well as possible charges for its executives and legal action from customers and shareholders. Several law firms in the US, including Clifford Law and Hagens Berman, have filed class action law suits against the German company. German public prosecutors says they are considering launching a criminal investigation into the scandal and are examining a collection of legal claims that have already been filed by private individuals against VW. Segolene Royal, the French energy minister, said Paris will be \u201cextremely thorough, extremely severe\u201d with VW. \u201cThe victims are workers whose situation has been made more precarious, consumers who were duped and also the state which pays subsidies for purchases of clean vehicles,\u201d Royal said. The board is holding an emergency board meeting to discuss the future of chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who said on Tuesday he was \u201cendlessly sorry\u201d for the crisis but refused to step down. Almost \u20ac25bn has been wiped off the value of VW since the scandal emerged last Friday. Shares in the world\u2019s second biggest carmaker fell another 10% in Germany on Wednesday, before recovering to rise 3% compared to the previous day. Other leading carmakers have also suffered further falls in their share price due to fears they will be dragged into investigations. Kirkland will offer VW some much-needed assistance as it gears up for legal battles on both sides of the Atlantic. The law firm led BP\u2019s defence in the criminal investigation into the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010, which claimed 11 lives. Britain and France have called for a European inquiry into the motor industry\u2019s testing. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and have been pushing for action at a European level for more accurate tests that reflect driving on the road.\u201d However, the trade body which represents European car makers insisted on Wednesday there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the scandal spread beyond VW. The European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, the ACEA, said it \u201crecognises the gravity of the situation and is taking this very seriously\u201d. In a statement it claimed that European rules will soon require testing to be conducted in \u201crealistic driving conditions\u201d as well as in laboratories, creating the strictest regime in the world. The ACEA added: \u201cThe automotive industry is fully supporting the development of this new Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test in order to ensure a more robust control on emissions. \u201cACEA hopes that the RDE testing conditions and timings can be finalised urgently, so that the industry can get RDE-compliant vehicles into the market as soon as possible. \u201cACEA will continue to engage with the European Commission and national governments to address the current challenges and ensure that trust and confidence in the car industry and clean diesel technology are maintained.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BHP Billiton has seen his pay cut by more than 40% due to shareholder losses and the death of five workers. The Anglo-Australian mining company said in its annual report that Andrew Mackenzie was paid $4.6m (\u00a33m) last year, down from $8m the previous year. Mackenzie\u2019s salary was unchanged at $1.7m but he received no payout of performance-related shares awarded in 2010 compared with a $2.6m payment last year. Carolyn Hewson, who chairs the remuneration committee, said BHP Billiton\u2019s total shareholder return was -15.2% in the past five years. That performance was worse than its peer group and far worse than the 78.6% positive return of the MSCI World index of companies in developed countries. \u201cThis level of performance results in zero vesting for the 2010 Ltip [long-term incentive plan] awards, and accordingly the awards have lapsed,\u201d Hewson wrote in the iron ore producer\u2019s report. The non-payment of Mackenzie\u2019s long-term bonus reflects the dire state of the mining industry, which has been hammered by plunging commodity prices as China\u2019s manufacturing growth has slowed. BHP Billiton\u2019s profits more than halved last year to $6.4bn and it has slashed investment and costs to cope with the downturn. Its shares have been down by about 60% since late 2010. Mackenzie\u2019s annual bonus fell to $2.3m from $3.1m, reflecting no payment for health and safety after five workers were killed doing their jobs. The company said the deaths were unacceptable and increased the health and safety component of Mackenzie\u2019s annual bonus from 20% to 25%. No employees were killed at work the year before. Hewson said: \u201cThis outcome was primarily due to the CEO\u2019s overarching accountability for the five fatalities that occurred during 2015. The committee takes the group\u2019s safety record very seriously and concluded, after taking advice from the sustainability committee, that a zero outcome was appropriate for the CEO\u2019s 2015 [short-term incentive health and safety] component, with the decision supported by Mr Mackenzie.\u201d BHP Billiton has cut the pay of its chairman, Jacques Nasser, to $960,000 from $1.1m and the basic salary for non-executive directors by $10,000 to $160,000. It said the reductions reflected difficult external conditions and a comparison with similar companies. Shriti Vadera, the former UK government minister and adviser to Gordon Brown, was made BHP Billiton\u2019s senior independent director last month. Vadera, who was already a non-executive director, will earn $208,000, the company said.",

      "bodyText": "A federal court judge in Los Angeles has declared the song Happy Birthday to You belongs in the public domain, dealing a blow to the music publishing company that has been collecting royalties from the song for decades. US district judge George H King ruled on Tuesday the copyright originally filed by the Clayton F Summy Co in 1935 applied to a specific arrangement of the song, not the tune itself. King ruled that Summy never acquired the rights to the song\u2019s lyrics, and the defendants\u2019 claims to the contrary were \u201cimplausible and unreasonable\u201d. \u201cBecause Summy Co never acquired the rights to the Happy Birthday lyrics, [the] defendants, as Summy Co\u2019s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics,\u201d King wrote in a judgment posted online. \u201cHappy Birthday is finally free after 80 years,\u201d said Randall Newman, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \u201cFinally, the charade is over. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Up until now, Warner Chappell Music, a division of the Warner Music Group, has charged people for use of the song. Among the plaintiffs was film-maker Jennifer Nelson, who was told she would have to pay $1,500 USD in order to include Happy Birthday in a documentary she was making about its history. Warner Chappell Music has been enforcing the copyright claim since it bought Summy\u2019s successor, Birchtree Ltd, in 1988. It reportedly paid $25m for the company. Jay Morgenstern, then executive vice president of the Warner Chappell Music Group, told the New York Times a year after the acquisition the song had proved \u201ca very good investment\u201d. Happy Birthday was written by sisters Parry and Mildred Hill in 1893, and is often claimed to be the world\u2019s most popular song. Without the court judgement, it would not have been freely available in the public domain in the US until 2030, and in the EU until 31 December 2016. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2015 to correct the year Happy Birthday was written in from 1883 to 1893.",

      "bodyText": "Last week the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revised down projections for China\u2019s growth over the next two years, and the price of our major exports has fallen 30% in the past year. Despite this the governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, remains upbeat about Australia\u2019s economy. One of the reasons is the performance of the services sectors \u2013 notably the tourism industry. With a falling dollar, Australia has again become a good place to visit \u2013 and an expensive place to leave. It\u2019s always a bit of a shock to note just how much the prices of iron ore and coal have risen and then fallen in the past decade. The RBA\u2019s index of bulk commodity prices (iron ore and coal) went from 54 in 2006 to 169 in 2011, and is now back at 54: In the past year the index has fallen 30%; in the past two years, nearly 50%. That is a massive collapse. And while many saw it coming \u2013 and indeed knew it had to come because the increase in production of iron ore meant that prices would have to fall \u2013 it\u2019s standard economics that an increase in supply, leads to a fall in prices. But the slowdown in China exacerbated the fall. Suddenly the chief buyer of our bulk commodities wanted to buy less than we had hoped and this also caused a fall in prices, because again it is standard economics that a fall in demand leads to a fall in prices. And the bad news for us is that the slowing in China has not finished. Last week the OECD revised down its prediction for China\u2019s GDP growth in 2015 from 6.8% to 6.7% and for 2016 from 6.7% to 6.5%: The OECDstill believes the world\u2019s economy next year will grow by 3.6%, but that is 0.2% points less than it was expecting in its previous update. The good news is that while the OECD may have become a bit more pessimistic, it still does see the overall world economy and areas like the US and the eurozone doing better in 2016 than they have for a number of years. But the fall in commodity prices is going to hurt our economy and there is no getting away from it. Stevens, in his appearance last Friday at the House of Representatives standing committee on economics noted that the drop in investment in the mining sector would end up being in the order of \u201c5% of GDP\u201d. But among his assessment of the economy he noted that with the fall in commodity prices has also come a fall in the value of the Australian dollar. Stevens noted that the fall was \u201cstarting to have more discernible effects on the pattern of spending and production\u201d in Australia. He noted that our dollar had fallen 25% against the US dollar and 18% again the trade weighted index (that is, against a basket of currencies based on our trade levels). Among the industries he singled out as being the main beneficiaries of this fall was the tourism industry. Tourism, unlike manufacturing and other industries that also benefit from a falling dollar, has very little lag time. People do make decisions on where to holiday some time into the future but nowhere near the length of time taken to organise export contracts with suppliers overseas as is the case with manufacturing and other industries. Thus a falling or rising dollar has a pretty quick impact on tourism. Most of our tourists come from New Zealand, which is less subject to changes in currency: But after that, China, the UK and US are the main conduits for tourism to Australia. A falling dollar can make travelling here much more attractive. Consider that at US$0.95 which is where the currency was in the middle of last year, a $200 a night hotel room costs US$190, but at US$0.72 which is where the currency is now, that same room is just US$144 a night. Little wonder that in the past year there has been a significant rise in the value of \u201ctravel\u201d exports \u2013 which includes spending by foreign visitors to Australia: But while international tourism is a vital export market, the falling dollar also helps by making it more attractive for Australian to holiday at home rather than away. Australians holidaying at home spend about $53bn a year \u2013 well above the $30bn spent by international tourists. Given a US$200 a night hotel room in the USA costs A$210 when the value of our dollar is US$0.95 but rises to US$277 a night at the current exchange rate, that makes holidaying at home rather more attractive. A recent speech given by the deputy governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe noted this factor. He observed that \u201cas the relative cost of overseas travel has increased, more Australians are holidaying domestically and more people are visiting our shores.\u201d He also noted that this was leading to \u201ca pick-up in investment in the tourism industry\u201d with the value of building work to be done on hotel and related accommodation soaring recently: However, the improvement in the tourism sector \u2013 and the services sector generally \u2013 highlights the difficulties with the changing economy out of the mining boom. The accommodation and food services sector is in economic terms almost the mirror of the mining industry. The mining industry is roughly 8% of our entire GDP, but employs just 2%; whereas the accommodation and food services industry accounts for about 2.5% of Australia\u2019s GDP but employs 7% of all workers: So a growing tourism sector is good for jobs, but is unlikely to fuel masses of GDP growth. Over the past 15 years, the mining industry has on average contributed 0.34 % points to annual GDP growth, compared to just 0.05% points by the accommodation and food service industry: That doesn\u2019t mean it is an unimportant industry, but that it is not the type of industry that leads to a boom \u2013 rather it benefits from economic good times rather than drives them. The transition from the mining boom is as much as anything about shifting from overdependence upon one industry for economic growth onto depending upon a number of them. The tourism sector after three years of being hammered by the high Australian dollar is now set to reap some benefit that has come via the collapse in commodity prices. It won\u2019t fill the entire whole left by the end of the mining boom, but it is one of a number of services sector industries that needs to pick up if we are to keep our economy and jobs growing.",

Suddenly the chief buyer of our bulk commodities wanted to buy less than we had hoped and this also caused a fall in prices, because again it is standard economics that a fall in demand leads to a fall in prices. </p> <p>And the bad news for us is that the slowing in China has not finished. </p> <p>Last week the OECD revised down its prediction for China\u2019s GDP growth in 2015 from 6.8% to 6.7% and for 2016 from 6.7% to 6.5%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"OECD projected growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qnEz7/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The OECDstill believes the world\u2019s economy next year will grow by 3.6%, but that is 0.2% points less than it was expecting in its previous update. </p> <p>The good news is that while the OECD may have become a bit more pessimistic, it still does see the overall world economy and areas like the US and the eurozone doing better in 2016 than they have for a number of years. </p> <p>But the fall in commodity prices is going to hurt our economy and there is no getting away from it. Stevens, in his appearance last Friday at the <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-09-18.html\">House of Representatives standing committee on economics</a> noted that the drop in investment in the mining sector would end up being in the order of \u201c5% of GDP\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/mining-boom-a-once-in-a-century-lost-economic-opportunity-report-finds\">Mining boom a 'once in a century' lost economic opportunity, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But among his assessment of the economy he noted that with the fall in commodity prices has also come a fall in the value of the Australian dollar. </p> <p>Stevens noted that the fall was \u201cstarting to have more discernible effects on the pattern of spending and production\u201d in Australia. </p> <p>He noted that our dollar had fallen 25% against the US dollar and 18% again the trade weighted index (that is, against a basket of currencies based on our trade levels). Among the industries he singled out as being the main beneficiaries of this fall was the tourism industry. </p> <p>Tourism, unlike manufacturing and other industries that also benefit from a falling dollar, has very little lag time. People do make decisions on where to holiday some time into the future but nowhere near the length of time taken to organise export contracts with suppliers overseas as is the case with manufacturing and other industries. </p> <p>Thus a falling or rising dollar has a pretty quick impact on tourism. </p> <p>Most of our tourists come from New Zealand, which is less subject to changes in currency:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Short-term arrivals to Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BIiMK/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But after that, China, the UK and US are the main conduits for tourism to Australia. </p> <p>A falling dollar can make travelling here much more attractive. Consider that at US$0.95 which is where the currency was in the middle of last year, a $200 a night hotel room costs US$190, but at US$0.72 which is where the currency is now, that same room is just US$144 a night. </p> <p>Little wonder that in the past year there has been a significant rise in the value of \u201ctravel\u201d exports \u2013 which includes spending by foreign visitors to Australia:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of travel exports\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r6Vlr/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while international tourism is a vital export market, the falling dollar also helps by making it more attractive for Australian to holiday at home rather than away. </p> <p>Australians holidaying at home spend about $53bn a year \u2013 well above the $30bn spent by international tourists. </p> <p>Given a US$200 a night hotel room in the USA costs A$210 when the value of our dollar is US$0.95 but rises to US$277 a night at the current exchange rate, that makes holidaying at home rather more attractive. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/australia-mining-boom-end\">Australian minister declares end of mining resources boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A recent speech given by the deputy governor of the RBA, <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-dg-2015-09-09.html\">Philip Lowe</a> noted this factor. He observed that \u201cas the relative cost of overseas travel has increased, more Australians are holidaying domestically and more people are visiting our shores.\u201d</p> <p>He also noted that this was leading to \u201ca pick-up in investment in the tourism industry\u201d with the value of building work to be done on hotel and related accommodation soaring recently:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of building work graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/85vt8/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>However, the improvement in the tourism sector \u2013 and the services sector generally \u2013 highlights the difficulties with the changing economy out of the mining boom. </p> <p>The accommodation and food services sector is in economic terms almost the mirror of the mining industry. </p> <p>The mining industry is roughly 8% of our entire GDP, but employs just 2%; whereas the accommodation and food services industry accounts for about 2.5% of Australia\u2019s GDP but employs 7% of all workers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Importance of mining graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5PHtg/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So a growing tourism sector is good for jobs, but is unlikely to fuel masses of GDP growth.</p> <p>Over the past 15 years, the mining industry has on average contributed 0.34 % points to annual GDP growth, compared to just 0.05% points by the accommodation and food service industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of industries to annual GDP growth graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PWqYQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> That doesn\u2019t mean it is an unimportant industry, but that it is not the type of industry that leads to a boom \u2013 rather it benefits from economic good times rather than drives them.</p> <p>The transition from the mining boom is as much as anything about shifting from overdependence upon one industry for economic growth onto depending upon a number of them. The tourism sector after three years of being hammered by the high Australian dollar is now set to reap some benefit that has come via the collapse in commodity prices. It won\u2019t fill the entire whole left by the end of the mining boom, but it is one of a number of services sector industries that needs to pick up if we are to keep our economy and jobs growing. </p>",
