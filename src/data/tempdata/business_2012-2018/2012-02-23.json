      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland pleaded to be treated as a fully commercial business as it confirmed it is paying out \u00a3785m in bonuses despite recording another loss \u2013 of \u00a32bn \u2013 last year. As the bank announced the fourth consecutive year of losses since its October 2008 bailout, chairman Sir Philip Hampton argued that it needed to be run on \"commercial grounds\" if taxpayers were to get their \u00a345bn investment repaid. The state is currently sitting on a \u00a320bn loss on its 82% stake, despite the shares rising 5% to 28.2p. Even as the bank insisted that bonuses were down and attempted to show restraint by imposing salary freezes on its 17,000 investment bankers and other high-paid staff, union officials were furious at 1% salary rises for branch staff who will not share in the \u00a3390m investment banking bonus pool. The retail arm recorded a jump in profits and David Fleming, Unite national officer, accused the bank of \"hypocrisy\". \"The bonus pot would give these low-paid employees approximately \u00a36,000, which amounts to simply loose change for a City slicker,\" Fleming said. Rival bailed out bank Lloyds Banking Group will also report losses on Friday and face a potential row over pay if it discloses a golden hello for new finance director George Culmer, who is to join in May. RBS insisted average pay for investment bankers had fallen 26% from \u00a3152,000 to \u00a3112,000 although calculations of average staff costs inside the investment bank showed they had remained steady at \u00a3144,000 despite a 54% fall in operating profit to \u00a31.5bn. The compensation to income ratio \u2013 which shows how much revenue is used to pay staff \u2013 rose to 41% from 34% and the Association of British Insurers argued that the \"figures make it difficult to judge\" how far RBS was sharing the spoils between employees, shareholders and to strengthen its financial position. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, accused the chancellor of doing \"nothing to change the excessive bonus culture that continues to roll on and on\". The average investment banking bonus was \u00a322,941, more than 50% lower than \u00a350,114 a year ago, while the bonus pool for the 146,000 staff across the group was \u00a3795m. For accounting purposes the \"variable compensation\" was \u00a3985m. Chief executive Stephen Hester said his colleagues should not hand their bonuses back as he did \u2013 and warned the \"noise\" around RBS was damaging. \"You can't have your cake and eat it,\" said Hester. \"If you want an RBS that is mired in the past, a British Leyland, then we should be judged on a different basis,\" Hester said. He defended the investment bank, saying that without the \u00a310bn of profits it had generated in the past three years another taxpayer bailout would have been needed. The \u00a345bn bailout had been enough to keep the bank afloat but not to cover the \u00a342bn of clean up charges incurred so far, paid for out of \u00a333bn of operating profits, Hester said as he described an an \"Alice in Wonderland\" world in which bigger losses were proof of success as the bank wound down its balance sheet. Some \u00a310bn of the clean-up bill comes from Ulster Bank's bad property loans. Ministers lined up in support of the pay deals, as did UK Financial Investments which controls the taxpayer stake. George Osborne said RBS was\"cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history\" and that \"bonuses at the investment bank are less than half what they were last year and less than a third of what they were in 2009\". Hampton admitted that ministers had been warned by \"many sources\" about the impact of anti-business rhetoric and not just on RBS. Hester revised down targets for return on equity from 15% to 12% but stressed that many other targets he set when he took the helm three years ago had been achieved, such as reducing the balance sheet by \u00a3700bn \u2013 which he described as twice the size of Greece's debt.",

Now that he's been bruised by three annual rows over bonuses, he appears to have decided to jab a finger into the UK public's chest and spell out a few home truths as he sees them. It makes for more entertaining viewing. We are told RBS contained the \"biggest balance sheet time bomb in history\". We are reminded that the investment banking division, even after handing out bonuses, has delivered \u00a311bn of profits over the past three years and that RBS, if deprived of that sum, would have had to ask taxpayers for an equivalent handout or go bust. Hester argues that RBS lives in an \"Alice in Wonderland world\" \u2013 his phrase \u2013 where losses are not entirely as they seem: sometimes they are evidence that another loose wire has been removed from the bomb. Thus he wants the freedom to run RBS commercially and, as he did not quite say, if you don't like the size of RBS's bonuses then take a look at what they pay themselves at Barclays. Fair point. RBS reckons its investment bankers rubbed by on \u00a3112,000 in salary and bonus on average whereas the Barclays brethren collected \u00a3199,000. Barclays Capital, it should be said, made a better return on equity (10.4% versus 7.7%). But, yes, RBS does seem to be some form of \"backmarker\" on pay, as George Osborne likes to put it. So it should be since the real moral of the tale is that neither bank's investment banking division is earning its cost of capital (a true measure of whether wealth is being created). Until that position reverses, shareholders are right to grumble that employees are helping themselves to an unfairly large slice of the pie. But when will RBS emerge from Wonderland? When will profits be profits, rather than capital to be diverted to mop up after Fred Goodwin's tea party? For all Hester's cheer and the healthy returns from retail and commercial banking, it's impossible to ignore the fact that the RBS group still reported a thumping bottom-line loss of \u00a31.9bn. Well, the good news is that \u00a3700bn of assets have been removed from RBS's balance sheet during Hester's three years at the helm. That leaves \"only\" \u00a394bn to go. Are these of more or less toxicity than the departed collection? It's very hard to say, which is one reason why the shares are valued at just 60% of book-value: the precise final cost of cleaning up RBS remains a mystery, especially when a holding of Greek bonds can still produce a \u00a31.1bn charge. What can be said is that RBS would be helped greatly if Ulster Bank, still spitting out an annual loss of \u00a31bn, can be turned around. But the worst is clearly over for RBS. The bank is stable, boasting a core capital ratio of 10.4%, and, barring an explosion in the eurozone, it's possible to see how Hester's five-year detoxification programme will be completed on time.",

    "webTitle": "FSA failed to interview key RBS board members for controversial report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority failed to interview seven main board directors of Royal Bank of Scotland before publishing its controversial report into what went wrong at the Edinburgh-based bank in the run up to its taxpayer bailout in October 2008. Of the 17 then-members of the board, three full-time executives and four non-executive directors did not provide personal accounts to the FSA board about the events that led to the \u00a345bn taxpayer rescue when the City watchdog was carrying out its inquiry last year. The report created a storm when it was published in December 2011 because \u2013 although it raised concerns about the \"assertive and robust management style\" of former chief executive Fred Goodwin and described the takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro as a \"gamble\" \u2013 no executives were directly blamed. The FSA has hitherto cited legal reasons for being unable to name the people it interviewed. But in a response to a freedom of information request by the Guardian the regulator admitted that it was in the \"public interest\" to identify the 15 individuals it interviewed in order to produce the first 346 pages of the 452-page report. That list contains some surprising omissions such as Larry Fish, the former head of US banking operation Citizens and one-time chairman of RBS America, Gordon Pell, the highly respected head of the retail bank, and Mark Fisher, appointed chief executive of ABN Amro after the takeover but who jumped to Lloyds on the weekend of the taxpayer bailout. Four non-executive directors at the time \u2013 Jim Currie, who had been on the board since 2001, Charles Koch, a board member since 2004, and Bill Freidrich and Janice Kong who had both joined in 2006 \u2013 were also conspicuous by their absence on the list of interviewees. There is no suggestion they did anything wrong or refused to be interviewed. Publishing the report was a laborious process as the regulator had not intended to produce a public account of the near-collapse of the bank. It had first commissioned a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers to look at, among other things, cash calls conducted by the bank in 2008 and the \"conduct, systems and controls\" of the investment bank at RBS. The FSA used this PwC report to announce in December 2010 that there was no case to take action against anyone at RBS and that it had closed its 17-month investigation into the bank. The FSA Board Report was commissioned after this to help produce what eventually become the final document released in December 2011, with the PwC report forming the latter part of the final product. The FSA said it was able to identify just five of the \"over 50\" interviewees whose evidence was used to produce this remaining part of the report. In explaining that it was in the \"public interest\" to disclose who had been interviewed for its Board Report, the regulator said: \"One element is that disclosure will provide the public with assurance about the thoroughness of the way in which the FSA's Board Report has been prepared.\" It is understood it took a very targeted approach about who to interview. It lists 15 individuals: Fred Goodwin and his replacement Stephen Hester; two former finance directors Fred Watt and Guy Whittaker; former investment banking head Johnny Cameron; the former head of internal audit Kevin Simons and former head of risk management Peter Nathanial; the current chief accountant Rajan Kapoor and current non-executive director Joe MacHale; former chairman Sir Tom McKillop and former board directors Colin Buchan, Archie Hunter, Peter Sutherland, Sir Steve Robson, and Bob Scott. For the PwC report, Jay Levine, the chief executive of the RBS Greenwich business, was interviewed. The FSA said that following consultation, Goodwin and Symon Drake-Brockman, who had been head of the investment bank in the US, had said they were \"content\" for it to be disclosed they had been interviewed by a team consisting of staff from the regulator and PwC. The FSA said it would not provide the names of others who had been interviewed if they had not been consented to be named.",

      "body": "<p>The Financial Services Authority failed to interview seven main board directors of Royal Bank of Scotland before publishing its controversial report into what went wrong at the Edinburgh-based bank in the run up to its taxpayer bailout in October 2008.</p> <p>Of the 17 then-members of the board, three full-time executives and four non-executive directors did not provide personal accounts to the FSA board about the events that led to the \u00a345bn taxpayer rescue when the City watchdog was carrying out its inquiry last year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/rbs-abn-amro-fsa-report\" title=\"\">The report created a storm when it was published in December 2011</a> because \u2013 although it raised concerns about the \"assertive and robust management style\" of former chief executive Fred Goodwin and described the takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro as a \"gamble\" \u2013 no executives were directly blamed.</p> <p>The FSA has hitherto cited legal reasons for being unable to name the people it interviewed. But in a response to a freedom of information request by the Guardian the regulator admitted that it was in the \"public interest\" to identify the 15 individuals it interviewed in order to produce the first 346 pages of <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/other_publications/miscellaneous/2011/rbs.shtml\" title=\"\">the 452-page report</a>.</p> <p>That list contains some surprising omissions such as Larry Fish, the former head of US banking operation Citizens and one-time chairman of RBS America, Gordon Pell, the highly respected head of the retail bank, and Mark Fisher, appointed chief executive of ABN Amro after the takeover but who jumped to Lloyds on the weekend of the taxpayer bailout.</p> <p>Four non-executive directors at the time \u2013 Jim Currie, who had been on the board since 2001, Charles Koch, a board member since 2004, and Bill Freidrich and Janice Kong who had both joined in 2006 \u2013 were also conspicuous by their absence on the list of interviewees. There is no suggestion they did anything wrong or refused to be interviewed.</p> <p>Publishing the report was a laborious process as the regulator had not intended to produce a public account of the near-collapse of the bank. It had first commissioned a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers to look at, among other things, cash calls conducted by the bank in 2008 and the \"conduct, systems and controls\" of the investment bank at RBS.</p> <p>The FSA used this PwC report to announce in December 2010 that there was no case to take action against anyone at RBS and that it had closed its 17-month investigation into the bank. The FSA Board Report was commissioned after this to help produce what eventually become the final document released in December 2011, with the PwC report forming the latter part of the final product. The FSA said it was able to identify just five of the \"over 50\" interviewees whose evidence was used to produce this remaining part of the report.</p> <p>In explaining that it was in the \"public interest\" to disclose who had been interviewed for its Board Report, the regulator said: \"One element is that disclosure will provide the public with assurance about the thoroughness of the way in which the FSA's Board Report has been prepared.\"</p> <p>It is understood it took a very targeted approach about who to interview.

Analysts had been concerned the company had not been winning enough contracts and relying on growth by acquisition. Indeed the company spent \u00a3341m buying 21 businesses in 2011 and says it has up to \u00a3200m for purchases this year.</p> <p>But it has recently won a couple of key contracts, including a British army recruitment deal which has eased worries about its business pipeline. Analyst Robert Morton at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Full year results for 2011 came in in line with expectations, with the benefits of acquisitions more than offsetting the organic decline in revenues. Behind the headlines, margins improved slightly, but cash conversion deteriorated. The shares de-rated in 2011 on the back of a slower market background, but the group has had a good run of contract wins recently. The group still has quite a bit to prove, but the better start to this year encourages us to maintain our hold recommendation. </blockquote> <p>But Robin Speakman at Shore Capital was less enthusiastic, repeating his sell recommendation:</p> <blockquote> The outlook statement for the current year is positive, as expected, with the impact of recent and expected future contract wins said to be leading underlying growth higher. We still note that margins are likely to have peaked last year and continue to see risk here as well as in revenues. Capita confirms that despite recent contract wins and disappointments the pipeline stands at around \u00a34.6bn compared to \u00a34.7bn last year. We remain cautious. <br> </blockquote> <p>And Julian Cater at Collins Stewart said the profits included a \u00a323.9m pension credit, free cash flow was down from \u00a3241m to \u00a3157m and net debt at \u00a31.33bn was around \u00a3200m higher than forecasts due to acquisition costs. He said:</p> <blockquote> Management's confidence in an acceleration in organic growth in 2012 is underpinned by recent contract wins and a replenishment of the bidding pipeline, though we still believe [Capita's] guidance for 2012 of 4%-5% will be a stretch. We think the inclusion of a one-off, non-cash pension credit is a low quality source of profits. Not only is the cash performance worse than we had expected but management has indicated that working capital terms in the future are likely to be less favourable, on average, than they have been in the past. <br> [But] bidding activity is particularly active in life and pensions sector, contracts in which could be material. Wins in this space would be a clear positive for the shares. </blockquote> <p>Rival <strong>Serco</strong> also benefited from Capita's figures, adding 17p to 556p ahead of its own results on Tuesday. A buy note from Panmure Gordon helped, with analyst Mike Allen saying:</p> <p>A pick up in organic growth coming through in 2012 is likely to lead to a re-rating of the shares despite the negative headwinds in the US, which should be a known factor as this has been well flagged. Our target price of 600p looks undemanding.</p> <p>Elsewhere there were mixed reactions to corporate news. RBS rose 1.39p to 28.72p and helped lift <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> 1.155p to 36.575p and <strong>Barclays</strong> 1.8p to 241p.</p> <p>But insurer <strong>RSA</strong> fell 5.5p to 107p on disappointment with its dividend despite a higher than expected full year operating profit of \u00a3884m. It blamed weak investment returns for a rise in the final shareholder payout of just 2%.</p> <p>British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> added 2.7p to 296.2p after full year profits of \u00a32.42bn, a flat performance but in line with City estimates.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished 21.34 points higher at 5937.89 after a mixed economic picture. German confidence figures and US weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected, but the European Commission cut its growth forecasts for the current year, predicting the eurozone will suffer a mild recession.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Cookson</strong>, the materials sciences group, climbed 30p to 670p after it sold its loss making US precious metals business to Richline, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Cookson chief executive Nick Salmon said:</p> <blockquote> This is a positive outcome for all parties. For Cookson, it represents a clean and timely exit, and for the business and its employees it offers the prospect of a viable and stronger future under Richline's ownership. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fenner</strong>, which supplies industrial conveyor belts to the likes of mining company, rose 14.7p to 481.8p after a buy note from Panmure Gordon which suggested the company could be a bid target. Analyst Oliver Wynne-James raised his price target from 515p to 540p and said:</p> <blockquote> Fenner is still a minnow in the world of mining equipment but we believe that its value to customers, its growth trajectory, its intellectual property and its entrenched market position is beginning to look appealing to the larger players in an increasingly-consolidated space. Its position is entrenched so the only way forward in this market is through acquisition. The mining equipment sector has seen various rounds of consolidation and there is pressure for participants to look into new areas of added value. It is still relatively bite-sized but its \"below the parapet\" status may not last for long given its ambitious growth plans and the wave of growth across its end markets that should lead to the all important higher installed base. <br> </blockquote> <p>He said a battle between Weir Group and FLSmidth over Ludowici - similar to Fenner in terms of expertise in seals, hoses and rubber linings - showed the takeover heat in the sector was being turned up.</p> <p>Aim-listed <strong>Oxford Advanced Surfaces Group</strong> was steady at 8p but traders were speculating about a forthcoming positive update, while <strong>Gold Oil</strong> jumped 28% to 3.625p after encouraging news from the Azar Block in Colombia - where it holds 20%. Drilling on the block is expected to start in April and take 35 days.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Paragon Diamonds</strong> dipped 0.75p to 31.25p despite talk it had found new exploration areas in northern Lesotho and had applied for extra licences.</p>",

Not only is the cash performance worse than we had expected but management has indicated that working capital terms in the future are likely to be less favourable, on average, than they have been in the past. [But] bidding activity is particularly active in life and pensions sector, contracts in which could be material. Wins in this space would be a clear positive for the shares. Rival Serco also benefited from Capita's figures, adding 17p to 556p ahead of its own results on Tuesday. A buy note from Panmure Gordon helped, with analyst Mike Allen saying: A pick up in organic growth coming through in 2012 is likely to lead to a re-rating of the shares despite the negative headwinds in the US, which should be a known factor as this has been well flagged. Our target price of 600p looks undemanding. Elsewhere there were mixed reactions to corporate news. RBS rose 1.39p to 28.72p and helped lift Lloyds Banking Group 1.155p to 36.575p and Barclays 1.8p to 241p. But insurer RSA fell 5.5p to 107p on disappointment with its dividend despite a higher than expected full year operating profit of \u00a3884m. It blamed weak investment returns for a rise in the final shareholder payout of just 2%. British Gas owner Centrica added 2.7p to 296.2p after full year profits of \u00a32.42bn, a flat performance but in line with City estimates. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 21.34 points higher at 5937.89 after a mixed economic picture. German confidence figures and US weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected, but the European Commission cut its growth forecasts for the current year, predicting the eurozone will suffer a mild recession. Lower down the market Cookson, the materials sciences group, climbed 30p to 670p after it sold its loss making US precious metals business to Richline, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Cookson chief executive Nick Salmon said: This is a positive outcome for all parties. For Cookson, it represents a clean and timely exit, and for the business and its employees it offers the prospect of a viable and stronger future under Richline's ownership. Fenner, which supplies industrial conveyor belts to the likes of mining company, rose 14.7p to 481.8p after a buy note from Panmure Gordon which suggested the company could be a bid target. Analyst Oliver Wynne-James raised his price target from 515p to 540p and said: Fenner is still a minnow in the world of mining equipment but we believe that its value to customers, its growth trajectory, its intellectual property and its entrenched market position is beginning to look appealing to the larger players in an increasingly-consolidated space. Its position is entrenched so the only way forward in this market is through acquisition. The mining equipment sector has seen various rounds of consolidation and there is pressure for participants to look into new areas of added value. It is still relatively bite-sized but its \"below the parapet\" status may not last for long given its ambitious growth plans and the wave of growth across its end markets that should lead to the all important higher installed base. He said a battle between Weir Group and FLSmidth over Ludowici - similar to Fenner in terms of expertise in seals, hoses and rubber linings - showed the takeover heat in the sector was being turned up. Aim-listed Oxford Advanced Surfaces Group was steady at 8p but traders were speculating about a forthcoming positive update, while Gold Oil jumped 28% to 3.625p after encouraging news from the Azar Block in Colombia - where it holds 20%. Drilling on the block is expected to start in April and take 35 days. Finally Paragon Diamonds dipped 0.75p to 31.25p despite talk it had found new exploration areas in northern Lesotho and had applied for extra licences.",

    "webTitle": "British Gas profits keep energy market reform on the agenda", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Centrica faced renewed criticism over household energy prices as the group reported annual pre-tax profits of \u00a32.4bn, with growth in its gas exploration and power business offsetting a slump in earnings at its British Gas arm. Despite a balmy 2011 pushing down revenues at British Gas, Centrica was still able to make a profit of around \u00a350 a household from its residential unit. Group pre-tax profits rose 1% in 2011, Centrica said on Thursday, with contrasting fortunes at its two biggest operations. Operating profit at its \"upstream\" operation, which includes eight power stations in the UK and is one of the largest gas producers in the North sea, climbed by a third to \u00a31bn. The \"downstream\" operation, dominated by energy provision for 10m UK households, saw the British Gas residential outfit report a 30% fall in operating profit to \u00a3522m. However, household bills remain the subject of scrutiny from the media and the energy watchdog, Ofgem, which has raised the threat of intervention if reforms including changes to tariffs do not work. Sam Laidlaw, the Centrica chief executive, said higher household prices last year were offset by lower usage due to mild weather \u2013 reducing the average bill by \u00a337 to \u00a31,024 compared with 2010. Last August, British Gas raised electricity prices by 16% and gas prices by 18%, although it has subsequently cut electricity prices by 5% while leaving gas prices unchanged. \"We need to raise public awareness as to what is on the bill and why bills go up, and that is driven by global wholesale prices,\" Laidlaw added. Compass, a left-leaning pressure group, accused British Gas and its fellow members of the \"big six\" UK energy suppliers of making a \"quick buck\" at the expense of consumers. \"We urgently need the government to intervene and impose a levy on the big six energy firms to help people with their bills, coupled with an independent public inquiry into energy just like we've had for banking and the media,\" said Hayes, Compass general secretary. Arguing that rising prices are a consequence of forces largely beyond its control, Centrica pointed to wholesale gas prices for next winter, which are 15% higher than for 2011. Nonetheless, a perennial criticism of energy companies is that when wholesale prices climb they are quick to raise tariffs, but are slower to cut them when the wholesale market retreats. This week another big six supplier, French-owned EDF, said earnings at its UK arm rose 8.5% to \u00a31.6bn in 2011. Laidlaw would not be drawn on the prospect of allowing a further cut in British Gas profits next year to help hold down household bills. \"That's a judgement we make all the time. It is a competitive market, that's the whole attraction, which would not be there if we had price caps,\" said Laidlaw, referring to an early day motion in the House of Commons calling for Ofgem to implement a ceiling on tariffs. Laidlaw also questioned the probable impact of Ofgem proposals, published this week, to force the big six to auction a quarter of the energy they generate. Ofgem hopes that selling this energy on the forward market, which guarantees supplies for months and years, will help smaller players compete by protecting them from short-term fluctuations in energy prices. Laidlaw said that Centrica already sells \"a lot\" of the energy that it produces on the open market, but is nonetheless a net buyer of electricity because of the scale of demand from residents and businesses. \"As Centrica, we are a net buyer of electricity, so we are in a similar position to the smaller companies.\" However, Ofgem's attempts to reform the market are backed by the government, with the new energy secretary, Ed Davey, welcoming the \"momentum that is building behind badly needed reforms of our energy market\". Laidlaw also reiterated the argument that energy firms need large profits to secure UK energy supplies \u2013 Centrica spent \u00a3246m on North Sea oil fields this week \u2013 and meet climate change goals, which will cost the energy industry \u00a3200bn.",

    "webTitle": "Redrow boss: 'tidal wave' of buyers shows no lost decade in housing sector", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of housebuilder Redrow, Steve Morgan, has strongly dismissed suggestions that the UK housing market faces a \"lost decade\" as the company posted an 80% jump in half-year profits. Morgan, who also owns Premier League football club Wolverhampton Wanderers, was responding to the negative stance taken by Collins Stewart on Wednesday. The City brokerage had said that \"UK housing could be stuck in a 'lost decade,' with tight lending putting pressure on prices and record low volumes\", adding: \"We believe government support for builders could backfire and \u2013 controversially \u2013 challenge the 'housing shortage' mantra.\" Analyst Alastair Stewart had then gone on to say that housing could remain caught for years between a weak consumer appetite for borrowing and banks' aversion to mortgage lending in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis. Transactions, prices and lending could all fall this year, he added. \"We differ from most peers in assuming at least two or three years of steady house price erosion, putting our estimates progressively below consensus,\" he said. Not surprisingly, Redrow's outspoken chairman and founder took issue with that analysis. Morgan said: \"What a load of bollocks. What is he smoking? Does he not look at the population growth? It's a bit like saying it's not going to go dark tonight.\" With house prices stabilising over the past 18 months, Morgan believes that confidence in the housing market is steadily increasing, including among first-time buyers, and that the availability of 95% mortgages under the government-sponsored NewBuy scheme at the end of March will provide a further boost. \"There's a tidal wave of people waiting to buy,\" Morgan said. \"We've had over 6,000 people coming in to enquire about NewBuy and we've got 550 firm registered interest[s] from first-time buyers.\" Figures released on Thursday showed the number of loans approved for house purchase hit the highest level in two years in January \u2013 further evidence that first-time buyers are rushing to take advantage of the stamp-duty holiday on properties worth up to \u00a3250,000 before it expires at the end of March. January's figure of 38,092 mortgages approved by high street lenders was 33% higher than the 28,539 seen in January 2011, British Bankers' Association (BBA) figures show. The number of remortgages was more or less static at 21,129 in January, from 21,192 in December 2011. The BBA's statistics director, David Dooks, said: \"January saw the high street banks approve more mortgages for house purchase than of late, despite low household confidence, as some people try to complete transactions before the stamp duty holiday ends in March.\" The first-time buyer rush was responsible for a 10% increase in mortgage lending in January, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, while the National Association of Estate Agents said the percentage of overall purchases in January made by first-time buyers rose to 23% from 21% in December 2011 \u2013 the third consecutive monthly increase in such sales. Asked for his budget wish list, Morgan called for more incremental increases in stamp duty. \"It's a very unfair tax and it's about time it was made fairer,\" he said. Redrow's profits before tax jumped to \u00a315.3m in the six months to the end of December, from \u00a38.5m a year earlier. Morgan, who returned to the company in 2009 after a boardroom coup, credited its success to focusing on family houses, highlighting the popularity of its \"New Heritage\" range of 1930s-retro family homes, which features on more than 70% of developments and sells at an average of \u00a3215,000 per unit. Redrow has bought six new sites in London and is also busy acquiring land in the north-west, Midlands and Wales. However, Peel Hunt analyst Robin Hardy was unimpressed. \"It's a little better than it was but there's no real fireworks. The news coming out of the sector is reasonably positive, but not dramatically so.\" Stewart said he held a \"relatively positive view of Redrow relative to mainstream volume housebuilders,\" pointing to its New Heritage range and tighter land bank.",

Transactions, prices and lending could all fall this year, he added.</p> <p>\"We differ from most peers in assuming at least two or three years of steady house price erosion, putting our estimates progressively below consensus,\" he said.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Redrow's outspoken chairman and founder took issue with that analysis. Morgan said: \"What a load of bollocks. What is he smoking? Does he not look at the population growth? It's a bit like saying it's not going to go dark tonight.\"</p> <p>With house prices stabilising over the past 18 months, Morgan believes that confidence in the housing market is steadily increasing, including among first-time buyers, and that the availability of 95% mortgages under the government-sponsored NewBuy scheme at the end of March will provide a further boost.</p> <p>\"There's a tidal wave of people waiting to buy,\" Morgan said. \"We've had over 6,000 people coming in to enquire about NewBuy and we've got 550 firm registered interest[s] from first-time buyers.\"</p> <p>Figures released on Thursday showed the number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/23/mortgage-approvals-two-year-high\" title=\"\">loans approved for house purchase hit the highest level in two years</a> in January \u2013 further evidence that first-time buyers are rushing to take advantage of the stamp-duty holiday on properties worth up to \u00a3250,000 before it expires at the end of March.</p> <p>January's figure of 38,092 mortgages approved by high street lenders was 33% higher than the 28,539 seen in January 2011, British Bankers' Association (BBA) figures show.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Hester, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, on Thursday likened the reduction in the balance sheet of the bailed out bank to the task facing the government of Greece. He said the cut in the balance sheet last year of \u00a3700bn was twice the size of the bailed out country's debt. He is now able to say that this part of the so-called \"funded\" balance sheet - the loans and investments - is under \u00a31tn. That is not to say that the entire bank's balance sheet has reduced below the size of the UK economy \u2013 it still stands at \u00a31.4tn. But it is still a dramatic cut from the \u00a32.2tn that the bank had ballooned to by the time it was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008. Hester published what he called his \"three-year report card\" which shows that while the share price might be giving taxpayers a \u00a320bn paper loss on their 82% stake, other elements of the plan are ahead of schedule. The core tier one ratio - the main measure of the cushion of capital that the bank holds - has moved from 4% at its worse to 10.6%, above the 10% target. The loan-to-deposit ratio - which measures whether the bank has enough deposits to cover the loans it grants - has shrunk from 154% to 108% against a target of equilibrium (100%) by 2013. The bank is also holding more liquid assets, which can be sold easily during times of crisis, up from \u00a390bn to \u00a3155bn, compared with a target of \u00a3150bn.

None of this can distract from the fact that the salvage costs have now reached \u00a342bn, swamping the \u00a333bn of profits generated during this time. As Hester pointed out, most of the problems rest with property lending, and particularly in Ireland. But if lending to small businesses is also a measure that is being closely watched, RBS might fail the test: lending contracted by nearly \u00a32bn to this sector in 2011, despite the claims by Hester that it was lending well above its market share.",
