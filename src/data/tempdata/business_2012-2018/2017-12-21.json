This is excellent news for the 2,000 employees in the UK who will keep their jobs, but little consolation for the 800 whose posts will be axed when 26 stores close next year. The pension deal that allowed Toys R Us to escape administration in the UK is a fudge. It is untidy and imperfect \u2013 but probably the best that could be negotiated against a tight timetable. At least the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry lifeboat, didn\u2019t try to over-sell the deal. The company\u2019s offer \u201cgoes a long way\u201d to addressing concerns, it said, choosing its words carefully. It means that not all its worries were answered. You bet. The PPF wanted \u00a39m to go into Toys R Us\u2019 defined-benefit fund up-front, meaning in the first few months of 2018. Instead, it has got \u00a32.2m up-front and \u00a31.6m next October, to be followed by two payments of \u00a33m in 2019 and 2020. You can call that \u00a39.8m but the extended timetable is a significant concession given that Toys R Us\u2019 long-term survival in the UK can hardly been viewed as certain. Some companies prosper after so-called company voluntary arrangements (CVA); others are back on their knees within months. In the case of Toys R Us, the stores look to be 20 years behind the times and Amazon is still on the prowl. But the PPF was surely right to take the deal. The minimum requirement here was to ensure that, in most circumstances, the position of Toys R Us\u2019s pension fund won\u2019t deteriorate. That concern has probably been met. Even if the company\u2019s self-help trading plan fails after six months, the pension fund will have more money in it. And, if Toys R Us recovers, the PPF has secured advantages \u2013 a corporate promise to de-risk the scheme and close the \u00a330m deficit over a shortened timetable of 10 years. Both pledges are worth having. A pragmatic compromise is not a surprise. The PPF arrives on the scene when crisis has arrived, so its ability to play hardball is limited. For better results in future, the Pensions Regulator needs more powers to intervene earlier. Behind Thursday\u2019s mini-drama at Toys R Us sits the unexamined tale of the write-off of a \u00a3584m inter-company loan between the UK business and the US parent. The regulator must get to the bottom of that story urgently. Developers should calm down over a few quid Housebuilders were never going to like Sajid Javid\u2019s \u201ccrackdown on unfair leasehold practices\u201d, but they brought it on themselves. The system, as the communities secretary says, is \u201cfeudal\u201d but it has been given a thoroughly modern spin by 21st century financing. All those onerous ground rents on long leaseholds have become an opportunity to convert cashflows into assets to be flogged to third parties, with the interests of leaseholders too often disregarded. Javid\u2019s measures are commendably strong. Developers will be banned from selling new houses on a leasehold basis, except where necessary, for example in cases of shared ownership. And ground rents on new long leases will be set at zero. That second policy sent shares in McCarthy &amp; Stone, a specialist in retirement homes, down 9%. Chief executive Clive Fenton was hopping mad, warning the proposal \u201cwill result in a disruption of housing supply\u201d. Up to a point, one can see why he\u2019s upset. Retirement \u201cvillages\u201d come with long-term maintenance agreements, so the ground rent could be considered akin to type of a service charge. But Fenton should calm down. His chances of securing an exception from the new rules are surely slim since Javid could just tell McCarthy to describe its charges properly and make them transparent. Such a switch might cost the company a few quid, but that\u2019s not the government\u2019s look-out. Either way, in the current housing climate, semi-threatening to build fewer homes is a poor way to ask for a favour \u2013 and probably ensures a thumbs-down. A \u00a3265m embarrassment for Skanska Another financial bubble? A year ago Swedish group Skanska sold a 40% stake in Connect Plus, which maintains the M25 motorway, for \u00a3265m. On Thursday, Balfour Beatty sold a 12.5% stake to a couple of infrastructure funds for \u00a3103m, implying its current 40% holding is worth \u00a3330m. So a motorway maintenance contract \u2013 which is all Connect Plus really is \u2013 has risen in value by 25% in 14 months. It\u2019s either an infrastructure bubble, or Skanska did a terrible deal.",

The supermarket chain conducted a series of emergency inspections of 2 Sisters poultry factories as a direct response to a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into its West Bromwich site at the end of September. It was revealed this week that 2 Sisters\u2019 Coupar Angus site in Scotland received what Tesco described as a \u201cred\u201d warning rating because of process issues identified during one of those inspections, on the same day as production was being suspended at the chicken processor\u2019s West Bromwich plant. In parliament on Thursday, John Grogan , a Labour member of the environment food and rural affairs committee, said: \u201cI think Mr Lewis has some explaining to do. Why did Tesco not provide this information, not just to the public but to the Food Standards Agency? All supermarkets should definitely do this in the future.\u201d Tesco said it \u201cworks closely\u201d with the regulator and had shared \u201cthe key findings from our inspections at 2 Sisters Food Group with the FSA\u201d. The supermarket chain handed the full Coupar Angus report to the FSA after being contacted by the Guardian and ITV. Three days after production at the West Bromwich site had been temporarily suspended and Tesco inspectors had filed their Coupar Angus report, Lewis was asked at a press conference about what failings had been found internally by 2 Sisters that were serious enough to halt West Bromwich\u2019s production. He declined to answer, but said the supermarket had since inspected all 12 of 2 Sisters\u2019 chicken factories and that he believed the problems were contained to the one site. Lewis said: \u201cHaving been to all the other [sites] \u2026 we didn\u2019t find anything that would indicate that what was seen in West Bromwich was present in any of the other factory sites. We did go to all other factories, so we don\u2019t think our inspectors have had the wool pulled over their eyes.\u201d Tesco said Lewis was talking about his inspection teams finding no evidence of food safety risks at 2 Sisters sites and that the chief executive was not routinely told about red ratings unless food safety breaches are identified. The process problems unearthed at Coupar Angus were all distinct from the issues in West Bromwich, where chicken was filmed being returned to the production line from the floor. Tesco insisted the Coupar Angus process issues \u201cwere addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues\u201d. The 2 Sisters Food Group has denied the West Bromwich undercover footage showed any food safety breaches and said it temporarily suspended production in West Bromwich because of \u201cisolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems\u201d. Tesco\u2019s Coupar Angus inspection did not find consumers had been put at risk or breaches of food safety. A spokesman for 2 Sisters said: \u201cITV and the Guardian are referring to standard inspection audits and appear to be trying to damage the reputation of our factories and potentially the livelihoods of 23,000 colleagues by misrepresenting them. There is and never was any risk to food safety at Coupar Angus. This is using old news to highlight issues which were resolved with our customer two months ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In decrying a universal basic income, Sonia Sodha has set up a straw man argument (Money for nothing is no panacea, 18 December). No serious proponent of UBI that I work with believes it is a silver bullet. Nor do we believe that it will suddenly fix the modern economy. It\u2019s clear to all that the current economic system is broken. Inequality is rising, as are rates of depression, self-harm, isolation and loneliness, and our planet is being ruined by a system that values growth at all costs. We know that radical changes are also needed to our tax system, to employment rights, and to working practices. But UBI is part of changing the agenda. It turns on its head the way we view work and welfare, and it is one response to the important question we should all be asking: who is the economy for? Business as usual \u2013 whether that be the welfare state designed for a different age, or exploitative, endless work \u2013 should not be the only option. A basic income would provide everyone with basic security, but also choice. It would give them the freedom to explore life outside of work, taking the strain off both individual workers and our planet. It is a revolutionary idea that would invigorate communities and individual wellbeing. Jonathan Bartley Co-leader of the Green party \u2022 Monday\u2019s Guardian contained the nice juxtaposition of Sonia Sodha\u2019s critique of universal basic income and an editorial on the scandal of growing wealth inequality. Sodha fails to mention that one major virtue of a universal basic income is that it would reduce wealth inequality in a direct and simple way. The wealthy would pay more in extra taxes than they receive in universal basic income, whereas for the poor the opposite is true. Peter Nicholas Pusey Malvern, Worcestershire \u2022 Sonia Sodha needs to think again about the potential impact of a basic income on the balance of power in relation to employment. The foundation of power for workers has always been the ability to withdraw labour. A basic income would increase that power immeasurably. It would no longer to possible for dodgy employers to get away with the kind of practices she mentions \u2013 \u201cwrist-based devices measure warehouse workers for speed and efficiency and track them right down to how long they take for toilet breaks\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t get the workers, and there\u2019d be picket lines at the entrances to the workplace. There would no longer be any possibility of starving people back to work. And yes, without a basic income it would be possible to pay adequate benefits, including for carers, and it would be possible to scrap the sanctions system \u2013 but that\u2019s the reverse of what we have seen happen under governments of both flavours. It\u2019s easy enough to pick off selected benefits to people who can be demonised or ignored. But the beauty of a basic income system is that it is universal, and that any cut to it damages everyone. It has the same power as the NHS to get backing from voters across the political spectrum. Moreover it has the potential to provide a radical and humane solution to issues around immigration, if free movement was available only to countries with an adequate basic income system. That would both remove the pressure that forces workers to emigrate when they would far sooner stay with their families, and it would provide an incentive for governments to introduce a basic income. No, it\u2019s not a panacea \u2013 but it\u2019s a very good idea. Once we\u2019ve got it it will be impossible to understand how we managed without it. Like the NHS, really. Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex \u2022 Your economics editor, Larry Elliott (18 December) asserts that economics is a neoliberal cult whose purpose is to ignore reality while concocting mathematical spells to justify markets that impoverish the many for the benefit of the few. That is simply wrong. Not only that, it is dangerous. Such ill-informed expert-bashing is exactly what gives politicians the excuse they need to make policy while ignoring evidence. Most economists are not astrologers trying to forecast the future, nor priests to the market gods. We analyse vast amounts of data to help design better policy. The study of economics is specifically focused on understanding market imperfections, human behaviour and the role government plays in determining wellbeing and life chances. Perhaps at the root of Mr Elliott\u2019s distorted view is his misunderstanding of the purpose of economic models. Critics complain that models are not realistic and make absurd assumptions. The London tube map is not realistic and makes absurd assumptions. If it did not it would be illegible and useless.

No serious proponent of UBI that I work with believes it is a silver bullet. Nor do we believe that it will suddenly fix the modern economy. It\u2019s clear to all that the current economic system is broken. Inequality is rising, as are rates of depression, self-harm, isolation and loneliness, and our planet is being ruined by a system that values growth at all costs. We know that radical changes are also needed to our tax system, to employment rights, and to working practices. But UBI is part of changing the agenda. It&#xa0;turns on its head the way we view work and welfare, and it is one response to the important question we should all be asking: who is the economy for?</p> <p>Business as usual \u2013 whether that be the welfare state designed for a different age, or exploitative, endless work \u2013 should not be the only option. A basic income would provide everyone with basic security, but also choice. It would give them the freedom to explore life outside of work, taking the strain off both individual workers and our planet. It is a revolutionary idea that would invigorate communities and individual wellbeing.<br><strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong><br><em>Co-leader of the Green party</em></p> <p>\u2022 Monday\u2019s Guardian contained the nice juxtaposition of Sonia Sodha\u2019s critique of universal basic income and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-1-democracy-or-oligarchy\" title=\"\">an editorial on the scandal of growing wealth inequality</a>. Sodha fails to mention that one major virtue of a universal basic income is that it would reduce wealth inequality in a direct and simple way. The wealthy would pay more in extra taxes than they receive in universal basic income, whereas for the poor the opposite is true.&#xa0;<br><strong>Peter Nicholas Pusey</strong><br><em>Malvern, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha needs to think again about the potential impact of a basic income on the balance of power in relation to employment. The foundation of power for workers has always been the ability to withdraw labour. A basic income would increase that power immeasurably.</p> <p>It would no longer to possible for dodgy employers to get away with the kind of practices she mentions \u2013 \u201cwrist-based devices measure warehouse workers for speed and efficiency and track them right down to how long they take for toilet breaks\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t get the workers, and there\u2019d be picket lines at the entrances to the workplace. There would no longer be any possibility of starving people back to work.</p> <p>And yes, without a basic income it would be possible to pay adequate benefits, including for carers, and it would be possible to scrap the sanctions system \u2013 but that\u2019s the reverse of what we have seen happen under governments of both flavours. It\u2019s easy enough to pick off selected benefits to people who can be demonised or ignored. But the beauty of a basic income system is that it is universal, and that any cut to it damages everyone. It has the same power as the NHS to get backing from voters across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Moreover it has the potential to provide a radical and humane solution to issues around immigration, if free movement was available only to countries with an adequate basic income system. That would both remove the pressure that forces workers to emigrate when they would far sooner stay with their families, and it would provide an incentive for governments to introduce a basic income.</p> <p>No, it\u2019s not a panacea \u2013 but it\u2019s a very good idea.

      "bodyText": "More than half of the UK\u2019s electricity came from nuclear power stations and renewables between July and September, official figures show. The record high share of 54.4% of power from low carbon sources was a result of the rapid growth in solar and wind power, according to the Office for National Statistics. During the same period in 2016 the share for low carbon electricity stood at 50%, and in 2015 it was 45%. The growth of green energy squeezed out fossil fuels, pushing the share of electricity generation from coal and gas plants to a record low of 42%. Including windfarms, solar panels, hydro schemes and biomass plants, renewables accounted for 30% of power in the third quarter. The all-time high was 30.7% in the second quarter of 2017. \u201cThis latest record is yet another nail in the coffin for the claim that renewables cannot be a sizeable part of the UK\u2019s electricity mix,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. The three months were not as windy or sunny as the year before, but this was offset by new windfarm and solar installations. The share was also helped by the return to operation of a wood-burning unit at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, which was out of action the year before. The green energy records are the latest in a string of milestones this year that demonstrate how dramatically and quickly the UK\u2019s energy mix is changing. Britain went without coal power for a day in April for the first time in more than 130 years. The country has since gone hundreds of hours without the polluting fuel in 2017, and coal generated just 2.9% of electricity between July and September. Solar has set several records and now provides a sizeable amount of power in the middle of the day. For one period on an afternoon in May, all the solar panels in fields and on buildings across the country were even generating more electricity than the UK\u2019s eight nuclear power stations. Wind power capacity has increased, too, though one of the biggest moments for windfarms was not growth but falls in price. In September windfarm developers secured a record low subsidy price to build wind turbines off the coast in the early 2020s in what experts said marked a breakthrough for the technology. Put together, the National Grid has said that renewables were now a \u201csignificant part\u201d of the UK\u2019s energy mix. According to one analysis, generation of renewable power has increased by more than 1,000% over the last two decades. Bulb, an energy company that supplies renewable power to more than a quarter of a million customers, said that at the current rate 2017 would prove to be a record year for renewables. The company forecast 100 terawatt hours of power would be produced by renewables by the year\u2019s end compared twith 208 for fossil fuels and nuclear based on an extrapolation of the official data so far this year. \u201cRight now we are at a moment where those new technologies are becoming cheaper than existing technologies. It now just makes much more sense,\u201d said the Bulb co-founder Hayden Wood.",

    "webTitle": "Thousands of UK Toys R Us jobs saved after deal with pensions body", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs at Toys R Us have been saved after the ailing toy retailer agreed to pump more than \u00a39m into its pension plan over the next two years in a last-minute deal with the state-backed pensions lifeboat. The Pension Protection Fund joined landlords and other creditors in backing Toys R Us\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA) plan, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores from next spring as well as reducing the size of others. Consultations with affected employees will commence in the new year. About 98% of creditors are understood to have approved the deal, without which the company was likely to have fallen into administration. While up to 800 people could still lose their job as a result of the restructure, more than 2,000 more will be saved as Toys R Us tries to turn its remaining UK business around. Steve Knights, managing director of Toys R Us UK, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have secured the support of our creditors and will be working closely with them in the months ahead. The vote in favour of the CVA represents strong support for our business plan and provides us with the platform we need to transform our business so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future. \u201cAll of our stores across the UK will remain open for business as normal until spring 2018. Customers can continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period.\u201d The PPF said earlier this week that it would not back the restructure unless Toys R Us agreed to increase its support for its pension fund. Talks on a deal lasted until 1.30pm on Thursday, more than two hours after the creditors\u2019 meeting to approve the restructure was intended to start. The company agreed to pay \u00a39.8m into its pension plan, composed of \u00a32.2m by March 2018 \u00a31.6m in October next year and a further \u00a33m a year in 2019 and 2020. Previously it had committed to paying only \u00a31.6m a year into the pension for the next three years. The deal will also result in the pension deficit recovery plan being shortened to 10 years, while the company has undertaken to seek additional support from its US parent company for the new plan for the pension scheme. As part of the deal, pension fund trustees will have greater powers to call in administrators if any of those conditions are not met. The compromise deal comes after the PPF initially demanded an up front payment of \u00a39m in the coming months. Malcolm Weir, its director of restructuring and insolvency, said: \u201cThis offer goes a long way to addressing the PPF\u2019s concerns and in de-risking the pension scheme, offering greater protection for the current and retired members in the pension scheme.\u201d The PPF was keen to secure better up front payments for pension schemes to protect its levy payers from having to pick up the bill for deficits after a series of high profile failures of businesses shortly after securing CVA deals, including BHS. Graham Barker, chair of the trustees, and Tom Lukic, director with Dalriada Trustees, who was recently appointed as professional trustee to the scheme on the advice of the PPF, said: \u201cWhilst the trustee board very much appreciate the impact of the CVA on a number of employees and stores, we are pleased that agreement has been reached for the PPF to vote for the CVA. \u201cWe will be writing to update all scheme members as soon as the result of the vote is known.\u201d Toys R Us suppliers attending the meeting on Thursday in central London told the Guardian there was relief that the deal had gone through. Chris Robinson, managing director of Suki Gifts International, a soft toy supplier which is owed thousands of pounds by Toys R Us, said he was pleased the CVA had been approved and that it was \u201ca common sense deal that was what everyone wanted\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s the most sensible arrangement for staff and suppliers.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of jobs at Toys R Us have been saved after the ailing toy retailer agreed to pump more than \u00a39m into its pension plan over the next two years in a last-minute deal with the state-backed pensions lifeboat.</p> <p>The Pension Protection Fund joined landlords and other creditors in backing Toys R Us\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA) plan, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores from next spring as well as reducing the size of others. Consultations with affected employees will commence in the new year.</p> <p>About 98% of creditors are understood to have approved the deal, without which the company was likely to have fallen into administration.<br></p> <p>While up to 800 people could still lose their job as a result of the restructure, more than 2,000 more will be saved as Toys R Us tries to turn its remaining UK business around.</p> <p>Steve Knights, managing director of Toys R Us UK, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have secured the support of our creditors and will be working closely with them in the months ahead. The vote in favour of the CVA represents strong support for our business plan and provides us with the platform we need to transform our business so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future. </p> <p>\u201cAll of our stores across the UK will remain open for business as normal until spring 2018. Customers can continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/19/uk-pensions-lifeboat-blocks-toys-r-us-survival-plan\">The PPF said earlier this week that it would not back the restructure</a> unless Toys R Us agreed to increase its support for its pension fund. Talks on a deal lasted until 1.30pm on Thursday, more than two hours after the creditors\u2019 meeting to approve the restructure was intended to start. <br></p> <p>The company agreed to pay \u00a39.8m into its pension plan, composed of \u00a32.2m by March 2018 \u00a31.6m in October next year and a further \u00a33m a year in 2019 and 2020. Previously it had committed to paying only \u00a31.6m a year into the pension for the next three years.</p> <p>The deal will also result in the pension deficit recovery plan being shortened to 10 years, while the company has undertaken to seek additional support from its US parent company for the new plan for the pension scheme. As part of the deal, pension fund trustees will have greater powers to call in administrators if any of those conditions are not met. <br></p> <p>The compromise deal comes after the PPF initially demanded an up front payment of \u00a39m in the coming months.<br></p> <p>Malcolm Weir, its director of restructuring and insolvency, said: \u201cThis offer goes a long way to addressing the PPF\u2019s concerns and in de-risking the pension scheme, offering greater protection for the current and retired members in the pension scheme.\u201d</p> <p>The PPF was keen to secure better up front payments for pension schemes to protect its levy payers from having to pick up the bill for deficits after a series of high profile failures of businesses shortly after securing CVA deals, including BHS. <br>  </p> <p> Graham Barker, chair of the trustees, and Tom Lukic, director with Dalriada Trustees, who was recently appointed as professional trustee to the scheme on the advice of the PPF, said: \u201cWhilst the trustee board very much appreciate the impact of the CVA on a number of employees and stores, we are pleased that agreement has been reached for the PPF to vote for the CVA.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be writing to update all scheme members as soon as the result of the vote is known.\u201d</p> <p>Toys R Us suppliers attending the meeting on Thursday in central London told the Guardian there was relief that the deal had gone through. </p> <p>Chris Robinson, managing director of Suki Gifts International, a soft toy supplier which is owed thousands of pounds by Toys R Us, said he was pleased the CVA had been approved and that it was \u201ca common sense deal that was what everyone wanted\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s the most sensible arrangement for staff and suppliers.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell will soon be selling electricity and gas direct to householders in the UK for the first time after buying one of the county\u2019s biggest energy suppliers, First Utility. The acquisition of the largest supplier outside of the \u201cbig six\u201d compounds a year of upheaval in the UK energy market, which is already being transformed by the proposed merger of Npower and SSE and the imposition of price caps. Shell has bought First Utility outright for an undisclosed sum, and will be supplying 825,000 households if the deal completes as expected at the end of February. Industry figures said the price was likely in the region of \u00a3200m-\u00a3300m. The move is the latest in a buying spree by Shell, which has acquired two electric car infrastructure firms in recent months as it diversifies beyond oil and gas. Mark Gainsborough, its executive vice-president of new energies, said: \u201cThe supply and demand of residential energy is rapidly changing, driven by new technologies that enable householders to better manage their energy use, and the need for a low-carbon energy system.\u201d Experts said the entrance of Shell into UK energy supply would cause a significant shake-up. Robert Buckley, research director at analysts Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cIt clearly is a brand that is an order of magnitude bigger than any other brand coming to UK energy retail. It\u2019s one that will make any competition sit up and take note.\u201d Buckley said it would be a good thing for consumers. \u201cOne of the issues that has come up consistently is having confidence in the brand you want to switch to, and people will have heard of Shell and have regular interaction with them through a forecourt,\u201d he said. First Utility, which launched in 2008 and has grown into the biggest independent energy supplier in the UK, has recently diversified, branching out into broadband supply earlier this year. The company said the takeover by Shell would enable it to develop new products for customers, including ones relating to electric car charging. Darren Braham, First\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cFirst Utility has brought significant disruption and competition to the energy market and this move will help us to capitalise on all the opportunities provided by digitalisation, decarbonisation and the move to battery technology and electric vehicles.\u201d Shell is entering a market which is under intense political scrutiny and faces the biggest change since privatisation with the introduction of a price cap on default tariffs in early 2019. Of the biggest energy suppliers, First Utility will be less affected by the measure because it has the lowest proportion of customers on tariffs that will be capped \u2013 23% compared to market leader British Gas on 67%. Gainsborough said Shell hoped to increase market share. \u201cWe are moving in with ambition to grow significantly over time,\u201d he said, adding that the company was undeterred by the threat of price caps. The reality is the UK is, counter to what many think, it\u2019s a very competitive market for household energy.\u201d Gainsborough continued that it was too early to say whether First Utility would rebrand but in terms of the management team it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d initially. Braham said the sector was in flux and Shell\u2019s scale would help it take advantage of that. \u201cI think there\u2019s a big change in the market with price caps coming, and the big six are quite vulnerable.\u201d He added that the company was also looking to expand internationally to other markets. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has been handed an early Christmas present after government borrowing dipped in November, beating City expectations that the UK\u2019s slowing economic growth would send the public finances deeper into the red. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell to \u00a38.7bn in November, down \u00a3200m on the same month last year. The consensus of City economists had been for a rise to \u00a39bn in response to sluggish wage growth, which has restricted income tax receipts and pushed up borrowing in October by \u00a3500m to \u00a38bn. The deficit for the current financial year \u2013 April to November \u2013 hit its lowest level in a decade, dropping by \u00a33.1bn to \u00a348.1bn over the period. A jump in tobacco tax receipts gave the chancellor a boost while the Treasury\u2019s strict welfare spending limits kept tax credit and housing benefit costs in check. But the gradual improvement in the public finances is expected to be cut short in the new year, with lower self-assessment income than seen in the last financial year. Tax changes last year brought forward tax payments by those with self-employment income, which the Treasury\u2019s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has said was unlikely to be repeated this year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe trend will deteriorate primarily because self-assessment tax receipts in January and February 2017 were boosted temporarily by about \u00a34bn, due to prior tax changes.\u201d The OBR cut its expectations for government borrowing this year to \u00a349.9bn in the autumn Budget but warned of a worsening picture for 2019 and beyond following downward revisions to productivity that will continue to restrict wage growth. Updating on its forecasts last month, the OBR called into question the chancellor\u2019s target for balancing the books by 2022, saying the government may not eradicate the deficit before 2031. Tombs said a series of one-off costs would also restrict any further improvements in the public finances, including payments to the EU, which would be about \u00a31bn higher in December than in the same month in 2016, when the UK received a net repayment of funds. He said central government investment would also need to grow strongly in the remaining months of this financial year in order to meet the government\u2019s spending commitments. \u201cAll told, borrowing is on track to meet, but not significantly undershoot, the OBR\u2019s November forecast,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chancellor can go on his Christmas vacation content that the public finances have weathered the economy\u2019s slowdown well this year. But with slow growth likely to persist next year and little margin for error now left to meet fiscal rules, it\u2019s unlikely that the chancellor will be able to soften his fiscal plans materially further again,\u201d he added. The UK\u2019s total public sector net debt, excluding state-owned banks, increased to \u00a31,734.8bn in November, equivalent to 84.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThis is the best year-to-date borrowing in a decade, but there is still further to go to repair the public finances. \u201cWe continue to build an economy fit for the future by taking a balanced approach, getting debt falling while investing in our vital public services and keeping taxes low.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for following the blog and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow morning. AM Before closing up for the day, some good news from Toys R Us where about 2,000 jobs are expected to be saved. The news follows an eleventh hour solution after the ailing retailer agreed to pump more than \u00a39m into its pension plan over the next two years in a last-minute deal with the state-backed pensions lifeboat. Without the deal, the retailer would probably have gone into administration. The Pension Protection Fund joined landlords and other creditors in backing Toys R Us\u2019s voluntary insolvency (CVA) plan, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores from next spring as well as reducing the size of others. Consultations with affected employees will commence in the new year. While up to 800 people could still lose their job as a result of the restructure, more than 2,000 jobs will be saved as Toys R Us tries to turn its remaining UK business around. Read the full story here: Balraj Sroya, trader at Foenix Partners, gives his take on US GDP for the third quarter, which was revised down to an annual rate of 3.2%. US GDP is still on track for Trump to keep to his campaign promise of 3% GDP for 2017 even as Q3 missed forecast projections. The GDP print came out lower than consensus at 3.2%, with the blame placed on weaker consumer spending. With the GOP tax bill being passed earlier in the week, Republicans are expecting the changes in tax code will see wages increasing and the average consumer having more disposable income. Once the fourth quarter growth figure is released, investors will be keen to see if Trump actually delivered on his pledge and whether the effects of the biggest tax reform in 30 years is beneficial for growth. There were 245,000 new US jobless claims in the latest week, more than the previous week and more than the 231,000 predicted by economists. The US economy grew by an annual rate of 3.2% in the third quarter, slightly slower than the 3.3% estimated previously. Despite the downgrade, it was the quickest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2015 and an improvement on the 3.1% growth in the second quarter. The FTSE 100 is up 35 points and outperforming its major European peers this afternoon, as investors remain fairly subdued. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,560 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 13,057 France\u2019s CAC: flat at 5,352 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: flat at 22,113 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,197 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 389 Billionaire property developers the Candy brothers have won a bruising high court battle after a judge dismissed all claims brought against them by a former friend for extortion, blackmail, intimidation and breach of the data protection act. Read our full story here: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has given his take on this morning\u2019s public finances figures, which showed borrowing fell in November. He says they are another reminder of broken Tory promises: These figures are further bad news just before Christmas following on from the IMF\u2019s gloomy outlook issued yesterday. They only remind us yet again of the broken Tory promises to eliminate the deficit by 2015. The national debt continues to grow despite the tricks the Chancellor attempted in his Budget last month with Housing Association debt to hide his failure on the economy. This continued failure by the Tory Government over these past seven years is simply unacceptable. These figures today reaffirm why we need an urgent change of course next year, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending the failed Tory austerity cuts. The next Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances with strategic investment underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, to help build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many not the few. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, takes a look at some of the detail in the November public finances data: Public borrowing in November was broadly unchanged from last year, but for the financial year to date the budget deficit is running around \u00a33 billion less than in the same period last year. This reflects central government receipts growing at around 4%, while central government spending has only been rising at around 3%. VAT, income tax, national insurance and stamp duty revenues have all been growing at a reasonable rate so far this year. As the OBR has indicated, however, self-assessment receipts in early 2018 may be less strong than in early 2017, so today\u2019s figures still leave public borrowing on track to come in at around \u00a350 billion in 2017/18 as a whole. Further progress on reducing the budget deficit may be slow over the next couple of years as Brexit-related uncertainty drags on UK growth, which we expect to lag some way behind both the US and the Eurozone in 2018 and 2019. However, the deficit is no longer at the dangerous levels reached immediately after the financial crisis, so the Chancellor can afford to take his time in making further progress towards his long-term objective of budget balance. For the moment, the greater priority is to provide short term support to the economy during the Brexit process and to fund much needed investment in housing, transport infrastructure and the NHS. The Treasury has responded to the latest public finances figures, seizing on the fact that borrowing in the fiscal year so far is the lowest since 2007. A spokesperson said: This is the best year-to-date borrowing in a decade, but there is still further to go to repair the public finances. We continue to build an economy fit for the future by taking a balanced approach, getting debt falling while investing in our vital public services and keeping taxes low. The jewel in Britain\u2019s manufacturing crown is at risk because of Brexit uncertainty and falling wages according to Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite. The latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the number of cars made in British factories destined for the UK market plunged 28% in November to 24,276. It was the fourth month in a row that cars built for the home market fell. Tony Burke, Unite assistant general secretary, said it was terrible news for Britain: This is awful news in the run-up to Christmas for the British car industry and the UK economy. The continued falling demand in the UK market because of Brexit uncertainty and falling wages is yet more evidence of the government\u2019s economic incompetence. When other economies around the world are motoring ahead, the UK is stuck in the slow lane hobbled by the biggest squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic era. Meanwhile uncertainty around Brexit is leaving motor manufacturers stalling on the investment needed to maintain Britain\u2019s world leading status in car making. The motor industry is the jewel in the UK\u2019s manufacturing crown, sustaining communities with decent well paid jobs. Government ministers need to rid themselves of their economic complacency and tackle falling incomes which are putting people\u2019s wallets and the UK economy into reverse. The UK government borrowed \u00a38.7bn last month, which was \u00a3200m less than the same month last year and the lowest November net borrowing since 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis. It was lower than the \u00a38.9bn predicted by economists. The figure for October was also revised down, to \u00a37.8bn from \u00a38bn, topping off some decent news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Borrowing in the fiscal year so far (April to November) was \u00a348.1bn, down \u00a33.1bn on the same period last year, and also the lowest since 2007. It puts the chancellor on course to meet the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s expectation that full-year borrowing to the end of March 2018 will be \u00a349.9bn. January usually brings a big surplus when annual income tax bills are due. The figures were boosted by the Office for National Statistics\u2019 decision to reclassify housing associations as private rather than public sector for the first time this month. This is estimated to have pushed down borrowing by about \u00a3300m. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says she isn\u2019t getting \u201ctoo carried away\u201d by the figures: While a continuation of the current trend would see borrowing undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast by \u00a37bn, some deterioration in the public finances should occur towards the end of the fiscal year. In particular, strong self-assessment tax receipts collected in January and February 2017 \u2013 due to changes in the dividend tax rate \u2013 won\u2019t be repeated. As a result, we doubt that borrowing will come in significantly below the OBR\u2019s current \u00a349.9 forecast for the 2017/18 fiscal year. However, if we are right in thinking that the OBR is too gloomy about the prospects for GDP growth, then borrowing should come down at a faster rate than it expects further ahead. Alex Buttle, director at the car comparison website, motorway.co.uk, is downbeat about prospects for Britain\u2019s car industry: This is a stunning fall in domestic demand and pretty much sums up the last six months for an industry reeling from punitive diesel taxes and crumbling consumer confidence. The fact that manufacturing levels fell just 4.6% last month, when domestic demand dropped off a cliff, shows just how reliant we are on exports. And that\u2019s probably more worrying than faltering demand, as right now we have no EU trade agreement and zero clarity over trading agreements with countries outside the EU. The UK car industry is teetering on the edge, and the economic landscape is unlikely to improve in 2018 with Brexit uncertainty ramped up to another level. The number of cars made in UK factories in the first 11 months of the year was 2% lower than over the same period in 2016, at 1.58m vehicles. If the weak trend persists in December, UK car production will have suffered its first annual fall since 2009, when Britain was in the depths of the financial crisis. In that year, production plunged 31% to 999,460 cars. Britain\u2019s listed house builders are among the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest fallers this morning: It follows the government\u2019s decision to go further than expected by forcing developers to ban controversial ground rents for all new apartments and houses. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, also said the government would go ahead with a ban on leaseholds on new-build houses, first announced in July. European investors are in no mood to celebrate this morning, with the major markets following Wall Street lower. It turns out the markets are not as ecstatic about the successful passage of Donald Trump\u2019s as the President himself. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: flat at 7,526 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 13,019 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,324 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 22,050 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 10,148 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 387 UK consumer confidence fell again in December according to the latest monthly snapshot from GfK. The index fell by one point to -13, marking almost two years of declining consumer confidence. GfK\u2019s Joe Staton said there was nothing to suggest the mood among UK households would pick up any time soon: We need to see several issues move on before the downward trend of the consumer mood changes. We need to have a better sense of how Brexit will pan out, and also of how quickly and how far interest rates will rise. But none of this will be resolved quickly so there\u2019s every likelihood that 2018 will take us lower. Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, has found something to be cheerful about in the UK car market: UK car manufacturing is on course to fall in 2017 overall. In the first 11 months of the year, a total of 1.58m cars rolled off UK production lines, down 2% compared with the same point in 2016. Vehicles destined for the UK market were down 9% over the period, to 322,551, while those destined for export markets were roughly flat at 1.25m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November was another poor month for Britain\u2019s car industry, which has been hit by falling demand in 2017 as consumers faced with Brexit uncertainty and falling real pay become less willing to splash out on big purchases. The number of cars made in British factories last month and destined for the UK market plunged 28% to 24,276 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the fourth month in a row of falling domestic demand, and the biggest drop of 2017. There was however a 1.3% rise in cars made in the UK and destined for export markets, as other economies fare better than Britain. Cars built to be shipped abroad totalled 137,214 and accounted for 85% of the total. Overall, car production fell 4.6% in November, as 161,490 cars left UK factories. The figures underline just how reliant on foreign trade the UK car industry is. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output. Whilst it is good to see exports grow in November, this only reinforces how overseas demand remains the driving force for UK car manufacturing. Clarity on the nature of our future overseas trading relationships, including details on transition arrangements with the EU, is vital for future growth and success.

The number of people in work fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to stand at just over 32 million \u2013 the steepest drop since mid-2015. It also followed a smaller fall of 14,000 in the three months to September. A \u201cBrexodus\u201d appears to be getting under way as net migration fell by 106,000 to 230,000 in the 12 months to June. In part this is because of the fall in the pound which lowers take-home earnings. The flow of migrants into the UK, who grease the wheels of the labour market, is now at its lowest level since records began. By that I mean they make the UK economy more flexible and able to respond more quickly to changes in demand. They are free to move about the country. Declines in the inflow of these skilled migrants will lower GDP as it will reduce mobility in the UK economy and cause skill shortages. Not unrelated to that there are already signs of the housing market also slowing. Migrants need houses. According to the latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, house prices in London and the south-east are falling already. Special focus needs to be put on real wage growth, which is a measure of wage growth adjusted for changes in inflation. For the seventh month in a row, real wages have fallen. Real wages are now below what they were in May 2010 when the Tory-Lib Dem coalition took office and have not changed at all over the last 16 months. They are still 7% below what they were at the start of the Great Recession in 2008. There is no sign that is going to change any time soon, as inflation is falling only slowly and there is no sign that there is going to be a pick-up in nominal wage growth, despite what the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee and the Office for Budget Responsibility have claimed for the last seven or eight years. Pay experts XpertHR reported this week that the pay norm of 2% continues. \u201cDespite unemployment falling and inflation rising through the year, employers have refused to budge from the muted pay increases they have favoured for a large part of the past five years,\u201d they said. Wages rising at 2% with prices rising at 3% is not good. Living standards will continue to fall for the foreseeable future. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 The latest economic data has been mixed, but there has been some positive news on consumer spending and on the global economy to offset continued evidence of a jobs slowdown. Investment uncertainty is still likely to remain a drag on the UK economy next year. A key issue driving the slowdown of the UK economy this year has been weakening consumer spending. The key short-term indicator of consumers\u2019 expenditure \u2013 the volume of retail sales \u2013 has fallen back from an annual growth rate of over 5% a year ago to just 1%, according to the latest figures for the autumn. However, a lot of this weakness reflects the squeeze from rising inflation and heightened political uncertainty in the early months of this year. More recently, retail spending has returned to a growth trend. Growth over the past eight months has been equivalent to around 4% per annum. The key issue for retailers will be whether we see this type of growth rate sustained into the crucial Christmas and New Year sales period. The world economy continues to perform well, with all the three main regions of the global economy \u2013 North America, Europe and Asia \u2013 growing at reasonably healthy rates. A good barometer of global economic growth is the growth of airline traffic \u2013 both passenger numbers and cargo volumes. This year the trade body for airlines, IATA, estimates global passenger numbers will be 7.5% up on 2016, the strongest growth for a decade with the exception of 2010 when there was a strong bounce back from the traumas of the global financial crisis. Air cargo volumes are projected to be up by 9-10% this year. Alongside this better news on consumer spending and the global economy, however, we have seen a significant slowdown in employment growth and the unemployment rate is no longer falling. It would not be surprising if unemployment started to edge up next year in the UK. Investment uncertainty continues to be a major dampener on the growth of the UK economy. 2016 and 2017 are likely to turn out to be the weakest years for UK business investment growth since the global financial crisis. 2018, therefore, looks set to be a relatively sluggish year for UK economic growth - with GDP rising by just 1.4% according to the latest PwC forecast. The UK will continue to languish at or close to the bottom of the global growth league next year. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Pound rises amid \u2018sufficient\u2019 Brexit progress Britain was deemed to have made \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the Brexit talks with the European Union earlier this month, helping to drive a rally in sterling on the foreign exchanges. The pound was helped by speculation before the deal that an agreement could be reached, after months of negotiations over the issues of citizens\u2019 rights, a financial settlement and the Irish border \u2013 gaining by almost 4% against the dollar in the month before the agreement. Since then, sterling has lost some of the gains, largely over concerns about the difficulty of the trade talks to start early in the new year. However, the pound remains more than 10% down against the dollar since the EU referendum in June 2016. FTSE 100 benefits from Trump bump Global equity markets have surged in the past month amid growing optimism in the US that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will make it into law \u2013 which would bolster the profits of global companies \u2013 a phenomenon known among City traders as the \u201cTrump bump\u201d. Britain\u2019s leading index of blue-chip shares, the FTSE 100, which includes several international firms, was no different last month, posting a gain of almost 2%. Markets have also taken strength from positive economic data in China and fading tensions between the US and North Korea. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 list, which has more companies rooted in the UK economy, has also made ground in the past month, gaining more than 2%. Worse than forecast Inflation increase adds to cost of living squeeze The run-up to Christmas was marred by an unexpected further increase in the rate of inflation, as the higher cost of importing food and fuel to the UK, owing to the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote, exacerbated the squeeze on British consumers. The consumer price index (CPI) rose to 3.1% in November from 3% in October, pushed higher by dearer computer games and a smaller November fall in airfares compared with a year ago. The increase forced the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, to write a letter to the chancellor to explain the failure of the central bank to keep CPI within a percentage point of its 2% target. Still, there is hope for consumers; with economists forecasting the worst of the impact from the pound\u2019s sudden devaluation after the EU referendum will soon pass \u2013 leading to a drop in inflation next year. Better than forecast Narrowing trade deficit is likely to buoy Brexiters Britain continues to import more than it exports despite hopes that the weakness in sterling since the EU referendum would help to increase exports. However, the trade in goods deficit came in at \u00a310.8bn in the three months to October, which was better than the forecast of \u00a311.5bn made by economists. The figures show the export of goods to non-EU countries increased as imports decreased, which will cheer supporters of Brexit who want to see the UK expand trade outside the single market. The trade in goods deficit with EU27 countries widened by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a323.9bn, as Britain bought more goods from them than it sold back. But when taking into account the UK\u2019s dominant services sector, the level of the overall trade deficit widened by \u00a3800m to \u00a36.9bn \u2013 showing the importance of a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU that encompasses services as well as the trade in goods. Weaker than forecast Key industries give mixed signals for economic growth Britain\u2019s dominant services industry showed signs of slowing in the last month amid Brexit uncertainty, as well as reporting the sharpest increase in prices they offer to customers since February 2008. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), a closely watched barometer of management sentiment about business activity, slipped to 53.8 in November from a six-month high of 55.6 in October \u2013 against expectations for the gauge to fall to 55. There was more positive news from the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors of the economy, which together account for about a fifth of GDP. The construction PMI jumped to 53.8 from 50.8 in October, beating expectations, while manufacturing also beat forecasts to record its strongest PMI in four years, 58.2 in November, up from 56.6 in October. Values above 50 indicate growth, while below contraction. Better than forecast Public sector finances improve Public sector net borrowing, excluding the nationalised banks, fell by \u00a3200m to \u00a38.7bn in November when compared with the same month a year ago. It was the lowest November net borrowing since 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis. City economists had expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to widen to \u00a38.9bn. Previous months have also been better than expected, meaning that for the first eight months of 2017, the deficit has fallen by \u00a33.1bn compared with the same period last year to \u00a348.1bn, also the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2007. Worse than forecast Britain\u2019s jobs boom shows signs of slowing Britain\u2019s job creation machine in the years of recovery since the financial crisis has finally chugged into reverse, after figures in the past month showed a fall in the number in work. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number in work fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to just over 32 million \u2013 the steepest drop since mid-2015. It also followed a smaller fall of 14,000 in the three months to September. The UK\u2019s unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3%, despite expectations for a further drop to 4.2% among forecasters. There was some good news however, as average weekly earnings excluding bonuses were 2.3% higher in the three month period to October \u2013 higher than expectations among City economists for wages to rise by 2.2%. Better than forecast Retail sales receive Black Friday boost Black Friday promotions helped increase high street and online sales in November, with retailers recording a monthly gain of 1.1% from the amount of goods sold in October. City economists had forecast an increase of 0.4% owing to rising inflation and weak earnings growth causing the biggest squeeze on living standards in living memory. The biggest gains came for sales of electrical goods \u2013 typically in hot demand on the US-inspired period of discounts. Economists have warned that consumers may have brought forward their Christmas shopping to take advantage of the cheap deal, which could mean weaker sales in the usually key month of December. Meets forecast Clouds gather over the housing market Property industry professionals are growing increasingly worried that Britain\u2019s housing market has stalled, according to the latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Prices in London and the south-east are falling, offset by stronger growth in Wales, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. The net balance of experts forecasting prices to rise across the country fell to zero from +1% in October \u2013 meeting the expectations of City economists. Sales are continuing to decline, albeit at a more modest pace than seen in recent months, with fewer people looking to sell their homes amid economic uncertainty. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 \u201cBrexodus\u201d of EU workers appears to be under way The risk of skills shortages was thrown into sharp relief over the past month, as official figures showed net migration to Britain over the year to June dropped by the largest amount since records began. EU nationals account for three-quarters of those who chose to return to their native country, as the data showed net migration to Britain fell by 106,000 to 230,000. As a consequence, businesses are growing increasingly concerned over skills shortages, according to leading lobby groups including the CBI. The worry is borne out in official figures which showed as many as 798,000 jobs vacancies in the three months to October. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The consumer price index (CPI) rose to 3.1% in November from 3% in October, pushed higher by dearer computer games and a smaller November fall in airfares compared with a year ago. The increase forced the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, to write a letter to the chancellor to explain the failure of the central bank to keep CPI within a percentage point of its 2% target. Still, there is hope for consumers; with economists forecasting the worst of the impact from the pound\u2019s sudden devaluation after the EU referendum will soon pass \u2013 leading to a drop in inflation next year. </p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Narrowing trade deficit is likely to buoy Brexiters</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/index-html-zip/giv-3902IyaFyKaaN08y\" data-alt=\"trade deficit\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/index-html-zip/giv-3902IyaFyKaaN08y\">trade deficit</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain continues to import more than it exports despite hopes that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/uk-manufacturers-weak-pound-exports-cbi-sterling-brexit\">weakness in sterling since the EU referendum would help to increase exports</a>. However, the trade in goods deficit came in at \u00a310.8bn in the three months to October, which was better than the forecast of \u00a311.5bn made by economists. The figures show the export of goods to non-EU countries increased as imports decreased, which will cheer supporters of Brexit who want to see the UK expand trade outside the single market. The trade in goods deficit with EU27 countries widened by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a323.9bn, as Britain bought more goods from them than it sold back. But when taking into account the UK\u2019s dominant services sector, the level of the overall trade deficit widened by \u00a3800m to \u00a36.9bn \u2013 showing the importance of a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU that encompasses services as well as the trade in goods. </p> \n<h2>Weaker than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Key industries give mixed signals for economic growth</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/pmi-zip/giv-3902o2TPUaBomMr6/\" data-alt=\"GDP\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/12/pmi-zip/giv-3902o2TPUaBomMr6/\">GDP</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s dominant services industry showed signs of slowing in the last month amid Brexit uncertainty, as well as reporting the sharpest increase in prices they offer to customers since February 2008.

There was more positive news from the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors of the economy, which together account for about a fifth of GDP. The construction PMI jumped to 53.8 from 50.8 in October, beating expectations, while manufacturing also beat forecasts to record its strongest PMI in four years, 58.2 in November, up from 56.6 in October.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is closing a turbulent year on steadier ground, as households defy the biggest squeeze on disposable income in living memory, a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month shows. In a period in which Theresa May won a deal with Brussels to move the Brexit talks forward to focus on trade, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker found pockets of strength in the economy \u2013 even as businesses express increasing concerns over the size of the challenge to come. There were some concerning developments. The cost of living squeeze intensified and there were signs that the country\u2019s jobs boom of recent years has come to an end. The International Monetary Fund used its annual health check of the UK to say that the Brexit vote in June 2016 was responsible for the economy\u2019s slower growth and stress that the government needed a deal with the EU that kept trade as free as possible. Businesses are also continuing to press the government to make further progress in talks with the EU, despite this month\u2019s breakthrough, warning they will keep hiring and investment plans on ice without greater clarity. Firms want to see a transitional deal to smooth the UK\u2019s exit from the EU as early as possible. However, there may be a long wait amid political tensions within the government. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows how sterling staged a recovery against the dollar before the government struck a deal with the EU27 to progress talks to focus on trade, while the FTSE has benefited from a global boom in share values as investors anticipate greater corporate profits owing to a package of tax cuts put forward by tDonald Trump. Among the strongest indicators of short-term economic strength for the UK was an unexpected increase in high street sales. Economists had thought rising inflation and sluggish wage growth would lead to a drop in spending, which has been one of the big reasons for a slowdown for the UK economy this year. But Black Friday promotions gave Britain\u2019s retailers a much-needed fillip, as sales figures for November show the US-inspired period of discounts led to a 1.1% increase in the total value of goods sold last month compared against October. City economists had expected a rise of 0.4%. There were warnings that consumers may have simply brought forward their Christmas shopping to exploit the steep discounts on electrical goods and other items, which may lead to weaker sales in the traditional boom month of December. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said it was positive to see strong consumer spending figures, because weaker retail sales had been one of the key issues driving the slowdown of the economy. \u201cThe key issue for retailers will be whether we see this type of growth rate sustained into the crucial Christmas and New Year sales period,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest economic data has been mixed, but there have been some positive news on consumer spending and on the global economy to offset continued evidence of a jobs slowdown.\u201d Britain\u2019s jobs-creation machine of recent years showed signs of chugging into reverse over the past month, as the latest official figures showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October. The Office for National Statistics said the upswing that began in 2012 \u2013 and persisted for a year after the vote to leave the EU \u2013 had petered out. There was also evidence of a growing skills shortages for British firms, with the ONS data showing 798,000 vacancies in the three months to October \u2013 the most since comparable records began in 2001. Economists have argued a slowing economy and the political maelstrom around Brexit will make firms reluctant to hire workers. Although some have said the rising number of vacancies is due to a weaker supply of employable people, as opposed to an outright drop in demand among firms to take on new staff. That could be caused by the biggest fall in net migration, as EU workers leave the UK after the Brexit vote. The latest official figures showed net migration to Britain fell by 106,000 to 230,000 in the 12 months to June. Still, the rate of unemployment remained at its lowest level since the mid 1970s of 4.3%. But that did little to improve the bargaining power of workers to demand better pay, as average weekly earnings remained below the growth in prices at 2.3%. The squeeze on British households intensified over the past month as the latest figures showed inflation edged higher to 3.1% in November from 3% in October. The Brexit vote has been directly blamed by economists, who say the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum has made it more expensive to import goods to Britain, pushing up prices on the high street. The weak pound does appear to have helped British exporters, with figures over the past month pointing to a jump in trade. Some economists are sceptical, though, suggesting that the increase has come from a recovery in global growth. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said car production in 2017 was on course to show the first fall since the economy was in recession in 2009, with exports failing to make up for a sharp fall in domestic demand. Britain continues to import more than it exports, although there was positive news as the trade in goods deficit came in at \u00a310.8bn in the three months to October, which was better than the forecast of \u00a311.5bn made by economists. Over the past month, there were also mixed messages from closely watched barometers of economic activity among businesses. Britain\u2019s dominant services industry showed signs of slowing after several months of resilience, while there was an upturn for both the construction and manufacturing industries. Although manufacturers only account for about 10% of the economy, they are benefiting from a boom in global trade, with the Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector rising to 58.2 in November from 56.6 in October \u2013 the strongest number in four years on an indicator where anything above 50 indicates growth. Most economists think UK economic growth will grow at about 1.5% this year before falling further in 2018, which is better than some of the gloomiest forecasts made just before the referendum for a Brexit-induced recession. However, it also places the UK among the slowest growing of the world\u2019s major economies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also expects growth to fall to 1.2% in 2018 and 1.1% in 2019, placing the UK at the bottom of the table for major nations. The absence of the Brexit vote could also have led to higher growth rates in 2017, according to Ross Walker, head of European economics at NatWest Markets, who said expansion of almost 2% may have been achievable. \u201cThe slowdown in the UK in 2017 stemmed, to a large extent, from the Brexit vote,\u201d he said, pointing to the squeeze on households from inflation owing to the weak pound, which had a knock-on effect for consumption and growth. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said real wages were below their level in 2010 when David Cameron\u2019s Tory-Lib Dem coalition government took office. \u201cThere is no sign that is going to change any time soon, as inflation is falling only slowly and there is no sign that there is going to be a pick-up in nominal wage growth,\u201d Blanchflower said. \u201cWages rising at 2% with prices rising at 3% is not good. Living standards will continue to fall for the foreseeable future.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d of laws, borders and money&nbsp;would not have been fulfilled. This&nbsp;is an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Norway model</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels \u2013 but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Canada deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to diverge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May\u2019s direction so far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>No deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes.

Firms want to see a transitional deal to smooth the UK\u2019s exit from the EU as early as possible. However, there may be a long wait amid political tensions within the government. </p> \n<p>To gauge the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was better than expected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f877f0866c8a9e82a0435bc5bc286c96cd8681\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f877f0866c8a9e82a0435bc5bc286c96cd8681/0_158_4643_2786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Davis and Theresa May meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier meet in Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Davis and Theresa May, left, meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, right, in Brussels.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Vidal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest dashboard shows how sterling staged a recovery against the dollar before the government struck a deal with the EU27 to progress talks to focus on trade, while the FTSE has benefited from a global boom in share values as investors anticipate greater corporate profits owing to a package of tax cuts put forward by tDonald Trump. </p> \n<p>Among the strongest indicators of short-term economic strength for the UK was an unexpected increase in high street sales. Economists had thought rising inflation and sluggish wage growth would lead to a drop in spending, which has been one of the big reasons for a slowdown for the UK economy this year.<br></p> \n<p>But Black Friday promotions gave Britain\u2019s retailers a much-needed fillip, as sales figures for November show the US-inspired period of discounts led to a 1.1% increase in the total value of goods sold last month compared against October. City economists had expected a rise of 0.4%. </p> \n<p>There were warnings that consumers may have simply brought forward their Christmas shopping to exploit the steep discounts on electrical goods and other items, which may lead to weaker sales in the traditional boom month of December. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/can-interest-rate-rise-halt-uk-inflation-experts-debate-data-brexit-watch\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said it was positive to see strong consumer spending figures, because weaker retail sales had been one of the key issues driving the slowdown of the economy. <br></p> \n<p>\u201cThe key issue for retailers will be whether we see this type of growth rate sustained into the crucial Christmas and New Year sales period,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe latest economic data has been mixed, but there have been some positive news on consumer spending and on the global economy to offset continued evidence of a jobs slowdown.\u201d</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s jobs-creation machine of recent years showed signs of chugging into reverse over the past month, as the latest <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/december2017\">official figures</a> showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a> said the upswing that began in 2012 \u2013 and persisted for a year after the vote to leave the EU \u2013 had petered out.</p> \n<p>There was also evidence of a growing skills shortages for British firms, with the ONS data showing 798,000 vacancies in the three months to October \u2013 the most since comparable records began in 2001.</p> \n<p>Economists have argued a slowing economy and the political maelstrom around Brexit will make firms reluctant to hire workers. Although some have said the rising number of vacancies is due to a weaker supply of employable people, as opposed to an outright drop in demand among firms to take on new staff. </p> \n<p>That could be caused by the biggest fall in net migration, as EU workers leave the UK after the Brexit vote. The latest official figures showed net migration to Britain fell by 106,000 to 230,000 in the 12 months to June. </p> \n<p>Still, the rate of unemployment remained at its lowest level since the mid 1970s of 4.3%. But that did little to improve the bargaining power of workers to demand better pay, as average weekly earnings remained below the growth in prices at 2.3%. </p> \n<p>The squeeze on British households intensified over the past month as the latest figures showed inflation edged higher to 3.1% in November from 3% in October. The Brexit vote has been directly blamed by economists, who say the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum has made it more expensive to import goods to Britain, pushing up prices on the high street. </p> \n<p>The weak pound does appear to have helped British exporters, with figures over the past month pointing to a jump in trade. Some economists are sceptical, though, suggesting that the increase has come from a recovery in global growth. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bdcab84b1dd7b509bb758a3031b06c9511df91f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bdcab84b1dd7b509bb758a3031b06c9511df91f/0_24_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A border Force officer checks a passport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are signs already that EU27 nationals are leaving the UK before Brexit, prompting concerns about skills shortages.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said car production in 2017 was on course to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/21/uk-car-production-hit-by-plunge-in-domestic-demand-business-live\">the first fall since the economy was in recession in 2009</a>, with exports failing to make up for a sharp fall in domestic demand.</p> \n<p>Britain continues to import more than it exports, although there was positive news as the trade in goods deficit came in at \u00a310.8bn in the three months to October, which was better than the forecast of \u00a311.5bn made by economists. </p> \n<p>Over the past month, there were also mixed messages from closely watched barometers of economic activity among businesses. Britain\u2019s dominant services industry showed signs of slowing after several months of resilience, while there was an upturn for both the construction and manufacturing industries. </p> \n<p>Although manufacturers only account for about 10% of the economy, they are benefiting from a boom in global trade, with the Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector rising to 58.2 in November from 56.6 in October \u2013 the strongest number in four years on an indicator where anything above 50 indicates growth. </p> \n<p>Most economists think UK economic growth will grow at about 1.5% this year before falling further in 2018, which is better than some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">gloomiest forecasts made just before the referendum for a Brexit-induced recession</a>.

      "bodyText": "Billionaire property developers the Candy brothers have won a high court battle after a judge dismissed all claims brought against them by a former friend for extortion, blackmail, intimidation and breach of data protection legislation. The three-year case pitted Mark Holyoake, a businessman with a colourful past, against his former university housemate Nick Candy, and the latter\u2019s brother, Christian. \u201cNone of the protagonists emerge from this trial with great credit,\u201d Mr Justice Nugee told a packed courtroom as he delivered the verdict. The brothers were cleared of all charges against them, but each of the parties \u201chas been shown to have been willing to lie when they consider their commercial interests justify them doing so\u201d. In a trial which dominated newspaper headlines, a succession of former friends, employees and business partners filed into the high court in London to share lurid details of the Candys\u2019 private lives and business dealings. Starting with a loan from their grandmother, the brothers made their fortune by riding the wave of London\u2019s luxury apartments boom. Their flagship One Hyde Park development near Harrods in Knightsbridge attracted Middle Eastern royalty, petro-billionaires and some of the highest prices ever paid for London real estate. Holyoake had sought \u00a3132m in damages, after accusing the brothers of using threats to force him to pay \u00a337m in interest and penalties on a \u00a312m loan provided by Christian Candy\u2019s property business to fund the purchase and redevelopment of a London mansion block. The Candys described Holyoake as a liar and a fraudster, saying he put none of his own money into the project, and overstated his net worth in order to deceive them. The judge agreed, saying in his verdict that Holyoake did not have the \u00a3120m fortune he had claimed in a statement of assets, and that as a result the lenders were entitled to treat the loan as in default. Nugee found that Christian Candy, who sat beside his brother in the public gallery to hear the verdict, had threatened to \u201ctake a wrecking ball\u201d to Holyoake\u2019s assets, but that the threat was not unlawful. In a statement, Holyoake said: \u201cWe, the claimants, are in a state of disbelief that Mr Justice Nugee has not ruled in our favour and intend to seek an appeal with immediate urgency. \u201cAnyone reading today\u2019s judgment will see that there are currently no winners here. I stand by our allegations and maintain that my own actions were deployed in self protection and wholly justified in the circumstances.\u201d After the hearing, the Candys said: \u201cIt has taken a great deal of time and effort to win this case and it has caused unwarranted damage to our personal and business lives. The claim should never have been brought. We look forward to time more positively spent with our families and in our respective businesses.\u201d The brothers are now seeking more than \u00a311m in costs from Holyoake, who was ordered to pay half the sum in January. Known as the \u201cbrothers bling\u201d, the Candys\u2019 rapid rise propelled them into a world of celebrity and obscene wealth. Nick wed the actor and singer Holly Valance at a star studded ceremony in Los Angeles five years ago, while Christian is married to the socialite Lady Emily Crompton. Witnesses at the nine-week trial set out the Candys\u2019 connections to household names, from the pop star Katy Perry, who was paid \u00a31.2m to sing at Nick\u2019s wedding, to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who were among the guests. Alongside the details of their celebrity friends, private jet and Candyscape yachts, the trial revealed a darker side to the brothers and their associates. There was mention of the murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who worked for an investigations firm whose director was a key Candy adviser. The brothers were accused of using violent language with their staff. A witness described how assistants were regularly reduced to tears, and claimed one employee had been fired \u201con the spot\u201d after disclosing he had a serious illness. Holyoake claimed Nick Candy had warned his outstanding loan could be sold to Russian debt collectors, and that Christian had told him to \u201cthink about your pregnant wife\u201d. Emma Holyoake told the court how she had turned the couple\u2019s Ibiza home into a fortress, installing CCTV cameras and hiring security guards. Nugee found that there had been no physical threat made to Emma Holyoake, although Christian Candy had made \u201can ill-judged and insensitive remark about her\u201d. The judge dismissed the case, saying there was \u201cno duress, undue influence, intimidation or unlawful interference with economic interests\u201d and no breach of the Data Protection Act. Whatever the ruling, the Candy brand has been dented. \u201cEven if you find us completely innocent,\u201d Nick told the judge during the case, \u201cthe rest of our lives there is going to be a slight smell.\u201d Holyoake approached the brothers in July 2011, seeking money at short notice in order to complete the purchase of a mansion block in Grosvenor Gardens, central London. Overnight, he secured \u00a312m from CPC Group, the Guernsey-based property business run by Christian Candy. He planned to convert the building from offices to luxury flats. What followed, claimed Holyoake, was a campaign of threats, abuse and intimidation directed at himself and his wife. Under pressure, Holyoake claimed to have entered into a series of further loan agreements which ultimately led to his repaying the original sum plus a further \u00a337m. In order to fund the interest, he said he was forced to sell Grosvenor Gardens. His plans to redevelop the building were abandoned, and as a result he said he missed out on the profits this would have generated. The first serious threats of legal action began in December 2014, and the case reached the high court last year with an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Holyoake to secure a worlwide freeze on any sales of assets belonging to the Candys, who have declared a portfolio worth \u00a3600m. The process has dented not only Holyoake\u2019s pockets but his own standing. The brothers cast doubt over his integrity, reminding the court that he had been investigated, (though never charged) by the Serious Fraud Office over the 2010 collapse of his fish importing business British Seafood. In a case that was eventually settled out of court, the blue chip investment firm 3i sued him for fraud, alleging that under Holyoake\u2019s management the company invented sales to inflate its size. The Candys\u2019 troubles may not be over. The most serious allegations mounted against them by Holyoake concerned not just their alleged treatment of him, but the creation of an allegedly artificial business structure designed, according to witnesses, to enable them to evade millions in tax. They vehemently deny the claims. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Their flagship One Hyde Park development near Harrods in Knightsbridge attracted Middle Eastern royalty, petro-billionaires and some of the highest prices ever paid for London real estate.</p> <p>Holyoake had sought \u00a3132m in damages, after accusing the brothers of using threats to force him to pay \u00a337m in interest and penalties on a \u00a312m loan provided by Christian Candy\u2019s property business to fund the purchase and redevelopment of a London mansion block. <br></p> <p>The Candys described Holyoake as a liar and a fraudster, saying he put none of his own money into the project, and overstated his net worth in order to deceive them.</p> <p>The judge agreed, saying in his verdict that Holyoake did not have the \u00a3120m fortune he had claimed in a statement of assets, and that as a result the lenders were entitled to treat the loan as in default.</p> <p>Nugee found that Christian Candy, who sat beside his brother in the public gallery to hear the verdict, had threatened to \u201ctake a wrecking ball\u201d to Holyoake\u2019s assets, but that the threat was not unlawful.</p> <p>In a statement, Holyoake said: \u201cWe, the claimants, are in a state of disbelief that Mr Justice Nugee has not ruled in our favour and intend to seek an appeal with immediate urgency. </p> <p>\u201cAnyone reading today\u2019s judgment will see that there are currently no winners here. I stand by our allegations and maintain that my own actions were deployed in self protection and wholly justified in the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>After the hearing, the Candys said: \u201cIt has taken a great deal of time and effort to win this case and it has caused unwarranted damage to our personal and business lives. The claim should never have been brought. We look forward to time more positively spent with our families and in our respective businesses.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers are now seeking more than \u00a311m in costs from Holyoake, who was ordered to pay half the sum in January.</p> <p>Known as the \u201cbrothers bling\u201d, the Candys\u2019 rapid rise propelled them into a world of celebrity and obscene wealth. Nick wed the actor and singer Holly Valance at a star studded ceremony in Los Angeles five years ago, while Christian is married to the socialite Lady Emily Crompton.</p> <p>Witnesses at the nine-week trial set out the Candys\u2019 connections to household names, from the pop star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/10/nick-candy-paid-katy-perry-12m-sing-wedding-court-told\">Katy Perry, who was paid \u00a31.2m to sing at Nick\u2019s wedding</a>, to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who were among the guests. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/20/candy-brothers-nick-christian-property-tycoons-brand-opulence\">Candy brothers: \u2018One day they were likely lads, then they were everywhere\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the details of their celebrity friends, private jet and Candyscape yachts, the trial revealed a darker side to the brothers and their associates.</p> <p>There was mention of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/09/christian-candy-adviser-linked-to-litvinenko-and-his-alleged-killer\">murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko</a>, who worked for an investigations firm whose director was a key Candy adviser.</p> <p>The brothers were accused of using violent language with their staff. A witness described how assistants were regularly reduced to tears, and claimed one employee had been fired \u201con the spot\u201d after disclosing he had a serious illness.</p> <p>Holyoake claimed Nick Candy had warned his outstanding loan could be sold to Russian debt collectors, and that Christian had told him to \u201cthink about your pregnant wife\u201d. Emma Holyoake told the court how she had turned the couple\u2019s Ibiza home into a fortress, installing CCTV cameras and hiring security guards. <br></p> <p>Nugee found that there had been no physical threat made to Emma Holyoake, although Christian Candy had made \u201can ill-judged and insensitive remark about her\u201d. The judge dismissed the case, saying there was \u201cno duress, undue influence, intimidation or unlawful interference with economic interests\u201d and no breach of the Data Protection Act. <br></p> <p>Whatever the ruling, the Candy brand has been dented. \u201cEven if you find us completely innocent,\u201d Nick told the judge during the case, \u201cthe rest of our lives there is going to be a slight smell.\u201d</p> <p>Holyoake approached the brothers in July 2011, seeking money at short notice in order to complete the purchase of a mansion block in Grosvenor Gardens, central London. Overnight, he secured \u00a312m from CPC Group, the Guernsey-based property business run by Christian Candy. He planned to convert the building from offices to luxury flats.</p> <p>What followed, claimed Holyoake, was a campaign of threats, abuse and intimidation directed at himself and his wife. Under pressure, Holyoake claimed to have entered into a series of further loan agreements which ultimately led to his repaying the original sum plus a further \u00a337m. In order to fund the interest, he said he was forced to sell Grosvenor Gardens. His plans to redevelop the building were abandoned, and as a result he said he missed out on the profits this would have generated.</p> <p>The first serious threats of legal action began in December 2014, and the case reached the high court last year with an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Holyoake to secure a worlwide freeze on any sales of assets belonging to the Candys, who have declared a portfolio worth \u00a3600m.</p> <p>The process has dented not only Holyoake\u2019s pockets but his own standing.</p> <p> The brothers cast doubt over his integrity, reminding the court that he had been investigated, (though never charged) by the Serious Fraud Office over the 2010 collapse of his fish importing business British Seafood. In a case that was eventually settled out of court, the blue chip investment firm 3i sued him for fraud, alleging that under Holyoake\u2019s management the company invented sales to inflate its size.</p> <p>The Candys\u2019 troubles may not be over. The most serious allegations mounted against them by Holyoake concerned not just their alleged treatment of him, but the creation of an allegedly artificial business structure designed, according to witnesses, to enable them to evade millions in tax. They vehemently deny the claims.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Toys R Us is locked in last-ditch talks with the Pension Protection Fund as it tries to secure support for a company restructure plan that could stave off administration and the loss of 3,200 jobs. The ailing retailer is trying to agree a compromise deal with the industry-funded pensions lifeboat, which has said it will not vote in support of an insolvency plan at a creditors\u2019 meeting at 11am on Thursday without more cash for the Toys R Us pension scheme. It is understood that talks went on into the early hours of Thursday and have picked up again after a break. Toys R Us is expected to go into administration if the company voluntary insolvency plan, which involves the closure of at least 26 loss-making stores as well as reducing the size of others, does not go ahead. The PPF wants \u00a39m be paid into the retailers\u2019 pension fund over the coming months. Toys R Us has said it cannot meet that demand but has offered to pay off the fund\u2019s deficit within 10 years, five years earlier than stipulated in its current plan, as first reported by Sky News. The scheme has 600 members and a deficit of about \u00a330m under the PPF assessment, or as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buy-out by an insurer. Trustees for the pension fund have brought in PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess the financial position of the company to ensure the pension scheme would not be weakened by the CVA. There are fears the process could lead to an even bigger claim on the PPF and its levy payers in future if the business does not survive long-term. Toys R Us\u2019s American parent company filed for Chapter 11, the US version of administration, in September after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts. On Wednesday, it revealed a $623m net loss in the three months to the end of October as sales at established stores slid 4.5%. While talks were expected to continue into Thursday morning, the industry-funded pensions lifeboat on Tuesday filed its proxy voting intention alongside dozens of other creditors who will vote on a Toys R Us planned company voluntary arrangement (CVA) insolvency procedure on Thursday. It is understood that creditors are able to change their vote at the meeting if Toys R Us and the PPF are able to find a suitable compromise. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
