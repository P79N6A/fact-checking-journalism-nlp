      "bodyText": "One of the biggest steelmakers in Britain, second in size only to Tata, has said there is no guarantee that the industry will survive if the government fails to step up its response to the current crisis. As the business secretary, Sajid Javid, prepared to travel to Mumbai for talks with the Indian multinational, the managing director of Celsa UK, Luis Sanz, asked why the British arm of his company was paying twice as much in electricity costs and eleven times as much in business rates than its operations in France and Spain. In an exclusive interview, Sanz argued that other European countries had a \u201cclear industrial strategy\u201d that recognised the importance of steel. He criticised the UK for reacting when it faced terrible consequences rather than taking proactive measures. \u201cIn other European countries they saw these problems coming and acted in advance,\u201d he said. Javid will try on Tuesday to deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis as he scrambles to try to secure a deal for Tata\u2019s loss-making British assets. The business secretary will first attend a series of meetings in the UK, including with tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, a potential buyer who has said his company, Liberty House, would only take on the project if it could avoid \u201cmass redundancies\u201d. The comments may provide some reassurance to 15,000 Tata Steel workers who are concerned about losing their jobs. Javid will also join David Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, for a discussion with Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, before a hastily arranged trip to Mumbai, in India, to discuss the unfolding situation with Tata\u2019s chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Cameron insisted that the government was \u201cdoing everything it can to find a long-term, viable solution to save the Port Talbot steelworks\u201d. Speaking ahead of the meeting with Jones he said he wanted to \u201cend the uncertainty for workers and their families\u201d. It was another dramatic day on Monday in the ongoing efforts to save the steel industry in Britain, in which: Jones recalled the Welsh assembly and warned that the industry faced a race against time, with just two to three weeks to secure a buyer. In a television broadcast to the nation he said it would be a \u201cstrategic disaster\u201d if the country stopped producing steel. Union leaders, after meeting for the first time together since the crisis unfolded, branded the government response a \u201cdisaster\u201d and called on Cameron to sideline the business secretary and provide answers himself. Welsh economy minister, Edwina Hart, warned against \u201ccherry picking\u201d of Tata\u2019s assets, as unions also raised concerns about a potential breakup of the company. Whitehall sources told the Guardian that Javid had placed his business department into \u201cfull crisis mode\u201d since returning from an official trip to Australia, which proved embarrassing when Tata announced its decision. Within the industry there is a lot of scepticism about whether a sale will be possible given Tata\u2019s admission that its British operations are losing \u00a32.5m a day and are now worth virtually nothing. Gupta admitted that it looked like a complicated deal but said he had already held \u201cencouraging talks\u201d with the government. He acknowledged that blast furnaces, which account for the bulk of employment at the biggest plant in Port Talbot, would be more difficult to turnaround than the rest of the UK steel industry. But he said one option would be to reposition the workforce from blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces, telling the BBC: \u201cI won\u2019t undertake something which will require mass redundancies.\u201d It came after Jones urged the UK government to keep nationalisation on the table, warning that the steel industry \u201ccannot be allowed to die\u201d. \u201cIf a buyer cannot be found within the sales period, the UK government must take the plants into public ownership until a buyer can be found,\u201d he told the Welsh assembly. That came alongside a fresh plea for state support after members of the Community, GMB and Unite trade unions held talks in London. They called on the government to back a plan that involves \u00a31.5bn being invested into Tata\u2019s operations over 10 years, with the government providing support for two to three years until the business is self-sufficient. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, said: \u201cIt is clear that last week the government\u2019s eye wasn\u2019t on the ball. It was a disaster. We have got to get the prime minister to intervene. There were more questions than answers last week. Now we are looking for answers to the questions.\u201d The warnings were echoed by Sanz, whose Cardiff-based Celsa UK is part of a larger company with operations across Europe including France and Spain. He said all other European countries had been more effective at cutting energy costs and driving down business rates. He said his company had paid a \u201crecord figure\u201d in green levies in 2015, and had yet to receive any of the promised compensation package on energy prices. Celsa UK has not yet seen a penny from a compensation package over energy prices despite a promise from Cameron in October that payments would be speeded up. The government admitted that only 5% of payments had been made to energy intensive companies, and could not say if any money had gone to steel yet. \u201cWe need a level playing field \u2013 we are not asking for handouts,\u201d said Sanz, arguing that Chinese dumping was heavily distorting the market. British steel companies were being asked to compete as exporters to boost the British economy, he said, but were struggling to compete domestically because of a series of challenges. He said the four key factors that needed urgent attention were energy costs, business rates, procurement \u2013 with more action to use British steel in public sector projects \u2013 and anti-dumping measures. European countries were doing more in all these areas, he argued. \u201cIn these countries there is a clear industrial strategy that understands that the steel industry is a foundation industry. \u201cIf we want 20% of GDP to come from manufacturing by 2020 \u2013 as the European commission has called \u2013 we need a strong steel sector and this has been understood by those governments.\u201d He said he had \u201chuge expectations\u201d that the government will take action and will do it quickly, \u201cbecause otherwise there will be no potential interest in the steel sector in the UK in the future. We are not going to issue threats but we can\u2019t issue guarantees either\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the fossil fuel industry appears increasingly shaky, the cost to the federal budget of stopping all new coal and gas projects in Australia has plummeted \u2013 costing less than 20% of what it was estimated to just 2.5 years ago, according to official parliamentary costings seen by Guardian Australia. The Greens have a policy of approving no new thermal coal or unconventional gas projects in Australia. That includes new mines, as well as expansions to existing mines. In 2013 the party obtained costings from the parliamentary budget office detailing their estimate of how much revenue the federal budget would lose as a result of reduced tax and any other costs, if the policy was implemented. It was then estimated the policy would result in the government missing out on $1.5bn over the forward estimates \u2013 the four years to July 2017. The Greens asked for the same advice again this year and that figure dropped dramatically to just $290m over the forward estimates \u2013 the four years to July 2019. With coal and gas prices dropping around the world, the number of new fossil fuel projects expected to be developed is now fewer than it was in 2013. In addition, the profits those companies would make \u2013 and the tax the government would therefore miss out on if they were banned \u2013 has reduced over the period. The costings fit with several other developments in recent months. AGL recently pulled out of the coal seam gas industry in Australia, citing a lack of expected returns. Peabody \u2013 the world\u2019s largest coal miner \u2013 has indicated it is likely to soon file for bankruptcy. ANZ alerted the Australian stock exchange that they had more bad debt than they thought, as a result of resource companies failing to make payments on their loans. Of the $1.2bn wiped from the tax revenue the government would expect to get from new coal and gas projects, just $70m was a result of the minerals resource rent tax being scrapped. The vast majority was due to fewer and less profitable projects. At the time of writing, the latest report used by the Parliamentary Budget Office to examine the number of future coal and gas projects was not available. But comparing the report used in the 2013 costing and the most recently available report (from October 2015) reveals a sharp decline in proposed coal and gas projects. In April 2013, there were 19 coal mines that had been publicly announced \u2013 a number that had dropped to just 10 by October 2015. Similarly, publicly announced liquefied natural gas, gas and oil projects had dropped from 12 to three over the period. Coal projects that had reached \u201cfeasibility stage\u201d \u2013 where more detailed planning work had been done \u2013 dropped from 57 to 39 over the period while those at the \u201ccommitted\u201d stage dropped from 16 to six. The Greens senator and environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said the figures show their policy was sensible. \u201cAs the world transitions to clean energy, the taxes collected by the federal government from the fossil fuel sector are rapidly diminishing,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have everything to gain from embracing the job-rich clean energy industry and ending approvals of new coal or gas mines. \u201cUltimately, the fossil fuel sector is a burden on our federal budget due to the subsidies it receives and the economic costs it adds through global warming and destruction of land and water.\u201d Waters said it also showed that, regardless of any policies that hasten the decline of the industry, the government needed a plan to create new jobs for those in the industry. \u201cThe thousands of Australian workers the fossil fuel industry is sacking as it declines must not be left in the lurch.\u201d She said those jobs should come from the work needed to rehabilitate mine sites and in the new clean energy industry. The executive director of coal at the Minerals Council of Australia, Greg Evans, said the coal industry had contributed more than $37bn in both company tax and royalty payments between 2007-08 and 2013-14. \u201cIt is an enduring industry and confining any analysis to just the forward estimates period misses the mark about the positive long-term demand outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry makes a substantial economic contribution and will continue to do so underpinning both base load energy provision in Australia and providing competitive and high-quality coal for Asia\u2019s energy and steel making requirements.\u201d",

He sold it to Thorn EMI in 1992 for a reported $1bn (or just over \u00a3560m at 1992 exchange rates).

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, Steve Rowe, has signalled he is prepared to make changes to the way the retailer is run by retaining personal control of the troubled clothing division. Rowe, who took the helm on Saturday, will retain oversight of the general merchandising division he had been running before his promotion to chief executive of the overall group. M&amp;S has two divisions: general merchanising (GM) \u2013 the bulk of which is clothing \u2013 and food. Rowe spent his first Saturday as boss in the Croydon store where he first worked aged 15. On his first day in the office on Monday he told staff he regarded the GM division as the retailer\u2019s number one priority. He also told staff he intended to focus more tightly on customers and make the business less complicated. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in keeping things simple. Doing things simply means we serve customers better, manage costs, and work more efficiently,\u201d Rowe said in a memo to staff. \u201cI wholeheartedly believe in the growth of this business. We need to work together and work smarter in order to do it, but I know that it\u2019s achievable and that we can achieve it in a profitable way for our shareholders,\u201d said Rowe. He has taken over just as M&amp;S prepares to announce a trading update on Thursday that analysts expect to show a fall of more than 3% in like-for-like GM sales in the fourth quarter. The food arm is expected to produce underlying sales growth of about 0.3% in the 13 weeks to 26 March. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry on looking after general merchandise,\u201d Rowe told Reuters. \u201cThe [GM] business unit directors will continue to report to me for the foreseeable future because that\u2019s where I believe the priority is ... We need to get GM working.\u201d An M&amp;S spokesperson confirmed that Rowe had told the team he would lead the division \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cHe sees GM as the number one priority for M&amp;S and is personally committed to getting it right. As a result, all the GM business unit directors will continue to report to Steve as they work together to move the business forward.\u201d The move could also signal a streamlining of the boardroom as the head of the GM division has traditionally had a seat at the board. Analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt marked the beginning of Rowe\u2019s tenure by upgrading their recommendation on the stock from hold to buy. \u201cThankfully we believe that new CEO Steve Rowe brings with him an appetite for change,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cAs CEO, we expect him to shake up a number of internal processes and make M&amp;S a sharper place in general, but most importantly, we believe he will take action on the things that really matter: product, pricing, service, merchandising and, in the round, getting closer to the customer,\u201d the analysts said. They noted that like-for-like sales in the GM division had risen in only one quarter in the previous 16. Rowe was formerly head of food at the retailer and was moved to take charge of the clothing and homeware division last summer. He was promoted to chief executive to replace Marc Bolland, who announced in January he would leave in April after doing the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d. Rowe, 48, has spent most of his career at M&amp;S. After a stint working Saturdays in the Croydon branch, he joined Topshop as a trainee when he left school at 18, before rejoining M&amp;S four years later.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson will receive a cash windfall of about \u00a3550m from the sale of Virgin America, the US budget airline the British billionaire launched in 2007, to Alaska Air. The Seattle-based airline said it agreed to pay $57 (\u00a340) a share, or $2.6bn, in cash for Virgin America, which flies to 21 destinations within the US and Mexico. Including Virgin America\u2019s debt and aircraft operating leases, the deal is valued at $4bn. Shares in Virgin America soared last month after reports that the company was in sale talks. Branson\u2019s Virgin Group owns about 30% after floating the business on the stock market in 2014 at $23 a share, valuing it at about $1.2bn. The takeover by Alaska Air means Branson\u2019s stake has more than doubled in value in the year-and-a-half since Virgin America sold shares to the public. The airline has attempted to stand out from established US competitors with typical Branson touches, including purple mood lighting in flight cabins and planes with names such as Virgin &amp; Tonic and Jefferson Airplane. It is the the ninth biggest US airline by passenger numbers, with about 1.5% of domestic flight capacity compared with 5% for Alaska Air. Branson said he was sad to see the airline bought by a competitor and that a 25% limit on non-US share ownership meant his influence over the decision was limited. Virgin\u2019s VX Holdings owns about 18% of the voting shares with the rest of Branson\u2019s stake in non-voting stock. But Branson claimed Virgin America had pushed the rest of the US airline industry into improving service for customers, whom he said had a grim time before his company shook up the sector. \u201cAs more airlines consolidated and grew larger and more focused on the bottom line, flying in the US became an awful experience. Despite moves to block our airline from flying, Virgin America has brought new competition, lower fares and a focus on creating an enjoyable in-flight experience to the US,\u201d he wrote in a blog on Monday. \u201cWhen Virgin America launched, fleetwide Wi-Fi was considered a radical idea, and so was touch-screen entertainment at every seat, and brand new and beautifully designed cabins. Airlines have had to invest in better products to try to compete.\u201d Virgin America made a pre-tax profit of $61m on sales of $1.4bn in 2014, according to its annual statement released in February. Alaska Air, which began life as McGee Airways operating a single three-seater plane out of Anchorage in the early 1930s, made an informal approach to Virgin America at the end of 2015 and became locked in a bidding war with rivals including JetBlue. Smaller US airlines are seeking to bulk up to compete with bigger rivals after US Airways and American Airlines combined in 2013 to form the world\u2019s biggest carrier. Alaska Air said Virgin America would give it a bigger business in California by expanding into San Francisco and Los Angeles, and strengthen its ability to compete against the larger US airlines. The deal will also give Alaska more slots at airports in the north-east US such as Ronald Reagan Washington national airport and John F Kennedy and LaGuardia in New York. Alaska has a market value of about $10bn and flies from more than 100 cities in the US, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico. Branson, whose wealth is estimated at \u00a34.3bn, made his fortune in the record business before branching out into airlines when he launched Virgin Atlantic in 1984 to take on British Airways on flights between the UK and the US. He owns 51% of Virgin Atlantic, which operates separately from Virgin America, after selling 49% to Singapore Airlines in 1999. Singapore sold the stake to Delta, the US budget carrier, in 2012. Brad Tilden, the chief executive of Alaska Air, said: \u201cWith our expanded network and strong presence in California, we\u2019ll offer customers more attractive flight options for non-stop travel. Together we will continue to deliver what customers tell us they want: low fares, unmatched reliability and outstanding customer service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Airbus has told its staff that a vote to leave the EU could choke off future investment in the UK. Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in the UK to design and manufacture aircraft wings, said it was committed to its British operations regardless of the referendum result. But it said a vote to leave could make it rethink future decisions about where to invest the group\u2019s money. In a letter signed by six senior Airbus executives, the company said: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what \u2018out\u2019 looks like.\u201d The aerospace giant\u2019s letter came as a survey of Lloyd\u2019s insurance workers found an overwhelming majority believe a British exit would be bad for the country\u2019s \u00a360bn insurance industry, and the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange gave vocal support for the EU. The Airbus letter, whose signatories include the firm\u2019s UK president, Paul Kahn, said senior staff \u201cfirmly believe that it makes good economic sense to stay inside the EU\u201d. The letter said: \u201cShould the British electorate have a different view then clearly we wouldn\u2019t cease our activities in the UK, which are highly important and very prominent. However, our business model is entirely based on our ability to move products, people and ideas around Europe without any restriction and we do not believe leaving will increase the competitiveness of our British-based operations. We all need to keep in the back of our minds that future investments depend very much on the economic environment in which the company operates.\u201d Airbus UK designs and engineers wings for aircraft, including the giant A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d, at a facility in Filton, south Gloucestershire. The wings are made on the Welsh side of the border with England, at Broughton, near Chester. Airbus estimates that its wing operations support about 100,000 jobs through the supply chain. About 70% of insurance professionals said leaving the EU would either hurt or severely damage 300-year-old Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market. But 6.2% said that leaving the EU would benefit the industry, according to a survey by City of London consultancy Haggie Partners. The campaign to remain in Europe also won vociferous support from Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of London Stock Exchange, which is in the midst of a merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Rolet said a Brexit would not only do damage the UK economy but could also cause economic problems around the world. \u201cI think this would be a geopolitical event that would reverberate way beyond the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be devastating to the economy of the United Kingdom, and would not be good for anyone with their headquarters in the European Union. The gaze of the United States would have to move back towards Europe, with a view to putting Humpty Dumpty back together again,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph. Chief executives of 36 British major companies including easyJet, BAE Systems and Shell signed a letter in February, in support of the UK\u2019s continued membership of the EU. But advocates of the UK leaving the EU point to support from around 250 business figures, including former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan and Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Kentish winemaker Chapel Down has tapped into enthusiasm for craft beverages to raise almost \u00a31.5m from small investors to build its own brewery for its Curious Drinks beer and cider business. The company said it had raised \u00a31.16m from a crowdfunding campaign in which investors gave as little as \u00a3100 each in return for shares in the business and various other benefits. It raised a further \u00a3275,000 from investors with at least \u00a325,000 to spend, and existing Chapel Down and Curious Drinks directors contributed the same sum. The total raised was \u00a31.71m. The company already makes cider at the Chapel Down winery, but its lager, IPA and porter beers are brewed for it by Everards, the independent Leicester-based brewer. It will now build its own brewery and a visitor centre at Ashford, about 12 miles from the winery, to bring brewing in-house and expand production. The benefits for investors putting in up to \u00a3499 include an annual guided tour for two of the brewery or the winery. Extra perks for those putting in up to \u00a3999, include a 25% discount on Curious Drinks. Those investing between \u00a31,000 and \u00a325,000 are also offered money off meals and drinks at the brewery and a discount on Chapel Down wine. The names of those putting in \u00a325,000 or more will be engraved on a fermentation tank. The fundraising effort easily beat the \u00a31m target set when it was launched in October. Construction of the brewery will start in June and the plant will start production early next year. As well as being close to the company\u2019s Tenterden base, Ashford has fast links to Europe via Eurostar and is developing into a hub for economic activity in Kent, according to Frazer Thompson, Chapel Down\u2019s chief executive. About a third of the 895 investors are from the business\u2019s home county of Kent. Thompson said the extent of local enthusiasm surprised him at first. The craze for craft beer and cider also helped fuel interest, he said. \u201cMaybe it shouldn\u2019t have surprised us, because Ashford has become such a driving force for the regeneration of Kent. Most people who buy a craft beer just have a beer, but our shareholders will have a beer and a story. \u201cWhen they go to the pub they\u2019ll be that bit more interested in whether it\u2019s being poured correctly or if the staff know about the beer and that\u2019s gold dust to us.\u201d Chapel Down started brewing in 2010 with Curious Brew lager, which uses the same champagne yeast as goes into its sparkling wines. The beer was named one of the world\u2019s best lagers at the 2012 International Beer Challenge, the industry\u2019s top awards. Thompson declined to give a target for the new brewery\u2019s output, but said the site would give Curious capacity to expand for the next four or five years.",

      "bodyText": "Despite earlier hopes that the US market would move higher at the open, it has slipped back in early trading. Investors appear to be unsettled by another move lower in the oil price, with Brent crude currently down 0.8% at $38.34 a barrel on concerns that a meeting this month between producers would be unable to agree a freeze in output. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 24 points or 0.14%, which has seen European markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 is now up 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both 0.4% better. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Three possible solutions to the Greek situation are examined by newspaper Kathimerini: Under the circumstances, there are three possible ways forward. First, continue on the same muddling-through path with the IMF in an advisory role. Obviously, the Fund has to compromise its positions. Second, the European lenders show the IMF the exit and assume the responsibility for the Greek program, sticking to the targets, accepting a milder austerity package and providing a politically acceptable version of debt relief. However, this may face political resistance in Germany and other countries. Third, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism accept the IMF\u2019s action plan. In this case, the primary surplus target should be lowered and generous debt relief should be provided. Undoubtedly, the three stakeholders in the Greek program have different political incentives. This makes a reasonable solution more difficult to reach. On the three possible ways forward outlined above, it seems the muddling-through approach would be the least productive but politics could continue to make it the dominant one. The remaining two approaches would face bigger political hurdles but could work better for all parties involved. After a slow start, European markets are edging higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.66% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.63%. Meanwhile US futures are showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average virtually unchanged, up around 8 points. Worries about the Greek bailout after the weekend\u2019s reported IMF threat have sent Greek bond yields higher. The two year yields climbed to a one month high of 11.15% while 10 year yields rose 26 basis points to 8.99%. The Greek bond prices are weakening following the report that the IMF threatened to leave the third bailout programme to put pressure on creditors - notably Germany - to reach a deal on debt relief. The IMF has denied this but managing director Christine Lagarde unsettled investors by saying the sides were a good distance away from a deal. The Athens stock market has also been hit, and is currently around 1.5% lower. Economist Stuart Culverhouse at distressed debt broker Exotix told Reuters: Markets are nervous that it could either delay progress on the subsequent reviews or lead to something more significant. I don\u2019t think there is much of a risk of default in the very near term but clearly if it absents official financing then it becomes more of a concern. Talks are due to restart today after a series of delays amid disagreements on the size of Greece\u2019s fiscal gap and the progress on pension reforms and bad debts. Here\u2019s the Greek payment schedule, courtesy of Bloomberg: The review of the Greek bailout programme is expected to be completed by the end of April or early May, according to a spokesman for the German finance ministry. But the Germans say a debt haircut is not on the agenda, Reuters is reporting, after the weekend\u2019s leak about supposed IMF plans. The spokesman said Germany was confident a solution would be found, but more work needed to be done. That tallies with comments from the EU: Here\u2019s our story on the weak UK construction figures: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has repeated its earlier warning that Britain could lose its much-prized AAA rating if the country votes to leave the European Union. Writing an opinion piece on the Politico website, S&amp;P\u2019s chief sovereign ratings officer Moritz Kraemer said: When Britain last held a referendum on its European Union membership in 1975, the stakes were not nearly as high. The U.K. had joined the European community only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.\u2019s deep political, financial and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught \u2014 and the risks, when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher. While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the \u201cEuropean experiment,\u201d they lack consensus on what Britain\u2019s trading options and political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty \u2014 especially protracted uncertainty \u2014 and this \u201cworking out\u201d period will likely have adverse credit consequences for the U.K... Brexit would further polarize the U.K.\u2019s political system, increase risks to effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.\u2019s long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political threats to territorial integrity. Consequently, a vote for \u201cLeave\u201d would likely lead Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to lower the U.K.\u2019s AAA rating \u2014 a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. While the U.K.\u2019s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns. The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank: While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months. While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, that is bad news for price pressures. More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February. The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 39,000 was the smallest drop since last May. Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline. Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly low. He said at an event in Rome (quote from Reuters): The prolonged period of low inflation we are in today has increased the risks that inflation misses might become persistent, which would be deeply damaging for the economy. This is why we have reacted so forcefully to secure our objective - and will continue to do so in the future if necessary. The UK construction data is disappointing, says economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: This is a largely disappointing survey, which suggests that construction output was of little help to GDP growth in the first quarter. Latest hard data show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016. The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage. With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector \u2013 so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February survey was at a near three-year low. Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction sector\u2019s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013. The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and global economic uncertainties \u2013 and it notable that the purchasing managers indicated that clients are \u201cunwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work\u201d. The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the uncertainties dogging the construction sector \u2013 especially given the tightness of opinion polls. On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that \u201csurvey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop\u201d Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine inroads into the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage). In November\u2019s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over \u00a32 billion a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade. Additionally, the government has announced measures aimed at speeding up the planning system and reducing the obstacles to building new houses. Eurozone investor confidence has risen but by less than expected. The Sentix index came in at 5.7, up from 5.5 but below the forecast of 6.9. Even without the weekend\u2019s leaks about Greece, the talks with its lenders would have been difficult enough anyway: Telecom shares have been hit by Friday\u2019s news of the collapse of a \u20ac10bn deal between Orange and Bouygues to create a dominate French operator. Bouygues shares have slumped 14%, with the company heading for its worst day in 17 years. Markit senior economist Tim Moore said: March\u2019s survey confirms that the UK construction sector is experiencing its weakest growth phase since the summer of 2013. Residential building has seen the greatest loss of momentum through the first quarter of 2016, which is a surprising reversal of fortunes given strong market fundamentals and its clear outperformance over the past three years. Construction firms were reliant on a rebound in commercial building and resurgent civil engineering growth to offset the slowdown in housing activity. Civil engineering delivered its strongest performance for just over a year, suggesting that a healthy pipeline of infrastructure projects continues to boost construction output. However, heightened uncertainty about the business outlook appears to have weighed on overall construction demand so far in 2016, with survey respondents citing cautious client spending patterns and a reduced willingness to commit to new projects. As a result, volumes of new work disappointed in March as order book growth slipped for the third month in a row and reached its weakest since the pre-election blip last year. A better than expected performance from the construction industry in March still meant that overall expansion remained at its weakest in nearly a year. The Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers index came in at 54.2 last month, the same as February\u2019s 10 month low but above forecasts of a dip to 54.1. The pace of growth picked up in commercial property and civil engineering but new home construction fell to its lowest level in three years. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the latest developments in the steel crisis in the politics live blog here: Meanwhile, Greece has started returning migrants to Turkey following the EU\u2019s deal with Ankara: Helena Smith is following the latest developments: The pound continues to edge lower in the wake of growing Brexit fears and a stronger dollar after Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE just about managed to be the best performing index this morning, its slight gains besting the mixed picture painted by the Eurozone. There is the chance that things could get worse for the UK index this Monday, however, with Brent Crude threatening to fall under $38 per barrel and copper dipping its toe below $2.15 per pound. So far the commodity sector is avoiding the kind of sharp declines it is now known for, though it is still early days yet and as investors are painfully aware the state of the oil and mining stocks can switch in a blink of an eye. Data-wise the only thing of note out of the UK today is the latest construction PMI, expected to rise to 54.3 from last month\u2019s 54.2. Whilst the FTSE flirted with flatness the pound began to tick lower after the bell, cable now hovering in the $1.42s following last week\u2019s dollar-boosting non-farm jobs report. Sterling likely wasn\u2019t helped by an Observer article over the weekend suggesting that, according to an online survey by Opinium, the Leave campaign has a 4 point advantage over the Remainers. Markets are struggling for direction, with the FTSE 100 now just about outperforming European rivals by edging marginally into positive territory. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: European markets are struggling to find positive momentum, despite a recovery in US markets on Friday. With oil and industrial metal prices once again under pressure, market risks appear to be increasing and investors need to start asking themselves if commodity prices are potentially warning of a turning point in equity markets, just as they did during the first quarter of the year? The US Fed has gone to great pains to tell the market that the future path of US rate hikes will be data-dependent. Nevertheless, the market retains its Pavlovian response to any suggestions by the Fed of what it actually expects to do. That might help to explain how US equities rallied so strongly on Friday after a slew of solid economic data suggesting that the US economy continues to recover. Over in Spain, and the latest unemployment figures have come in better than expected. The number of people registered as unemployed fell by 1.4% or 58,216 people in March, leaving 4.09m out of work. This follows two months of rises, and compares with a forecast decline of 50,000. Back with Greece, and the government has denied it was behind the leak of the supposed IMF threat to push the country close to default. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: The Greek government has brushed off suggestions that the government may be connected to the publication of a transcript of an apparently secretly recorded telephone conversation between IMF officials discussing the Greek bailout. \u201cGreece has no reason to leak or wiretap [conversations],\u201d junior Defense Minister Dimitris Vitsas said on Monday. \u201cThe most well-protected people in the country at the moment are the members of the negotiating team,\u201d Vitsas said. \u201cWe provide them with the best possible treatment.\u201d Stock markets are edging lower at the start of the week\u2019s trading, with oil prices on the slide again. Hopes of an agreement to curb supply at a meeting later this month appear to be dimming again, with Iran saying it plans to increase output until it gets back to its pre-sanction level. Other producers have said they would only take part in a freeze if Iran also agreed to a deal. So Brent crude has slipped nearly 1% to $38.29 a barrel. So the FTSE 100 is currently down around 8 points at 6138 while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are also slightly lower. In Asia the Nikkei 225 dipped 0.25%. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Greece is back in the spotlight after a weekend of leaks, claims and counter-claims. with reports that the International Monetary Fund would push the country close to default as part of a negotiating ploy on its bailout deal. The IMF has swiftly denied the idea but said a deal was still \u201ca good distance away.\u201d Documents released by WikiLeaks appeared to show senior officials from the IMF discussing tactics to apply pressure on Greece and its lenders - especially Germany - to reach a deal on the latest bailout agreement this month. Part of the transcript included a threat that the IMF might not participate in the third bailout programme as a way of forcing a deal on debt relief before the UK\u2019s referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union. Lenders are due to resume talks today on the progress of the reforms Greece needs to make as part of the bailout agreement, which should pave the way for some kind of debt restructuring. But the leaked documents have soured the mood, with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras demanding that the IMF clarify its position. In response, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has released a letter dening the claims. She said: Any speculation that IMF staff would consider using a credit event as a negotiating tactic is simply nonsense.... The IMF conducts its negotiations in good faith, not by way of threats, and we do not communicate through leaks. She added: We are still a good distance away from having a coherent program that I can present to our Executive Board. I have on many occasions stressed that we can only support a program that is credible and based on realistic assumptions, and that delivers on its objective of setting Greece on a path of robust growth while gradually restoring debt sustainability. Elsewhere, on a fairly quiet day for economic news, there are eurozone consumer confidence and unemployment figures, the latest construction PMI data, as well as US durable goods orders. And we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the latest developments in the UK steel crisis, with unions due to meet today and various buyers said to be interested in some of the plants put up for sale by owner Tata.

The U.K. had joined the European community only two years earlier. But today, given the U.K.\u2019s deep political, financial and trading ties in Europe, an exit would be much more fraught \u2014 and the risks, when it comes to its credit worthiness, are therefore considerably higher.</p> <p>While Brexit supporters share a collective skepticism about the \u201cEuropean experiment,\u201d they lack consensus on what Britain\u2019s trading options and political alliances will look like outside of the EU. If the Brexit camp wins the vote on June 23, the U.K. would enter a protracted period of uncertainty while its people debate the alternative. Markets dislike uncertainty \u2014 especially protracted uncertainty \u2014 and this \u201cworking out\u201d period will likely have adverse credit consequences for the U.K...</p> <p>Brexit would further polarize the U.K.\u2019s political system, increase risks to effective, transparent and predictable policymaking, and diminish the U.K.\u2019s long-term sovereign creditworthiness. Brexit also heightens potential risks to economic growth and the balance of payments, as well as domestic political threats to territorial integrity.</p> <p>Consequently, a vote for \u201cLeave\u201d would likely lead Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to lower the U.K.\u2019s AAA rating \u2014 a rating it has held, without interruption, since 1978. While the U.K.\u2019s rating would likely remain high given its many institutional, financial and economic strengths, the U.K. would lose its place in the increasingly exclusive club of AAA-rated sovereigns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T10:28:36.008Z\">at 11.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5702358ae4b0f2216ccb286f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T09:38:14.975Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The falls in the eurozone unemployment rate could slow down in the coming months, says Bert Colijn at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While dark clouds packed over the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, the labour market has continued to provide tailwind. The improvements in unemployment continue to fuel domestic demand in times when consumers have become more cautious. This will likely mitigate the negative effects of people more concerned about the state of the global economy.The improvements are not evenly spread across the Eurozone though. France and Italy saw the number of unemployed increase in February, although in France this did not lead to a higher unemployment rate. Germany and Spain saw unemployment decline again, with the unemployment rate in Spain falling from 20.5% to 20.4%. The continued struggle to reduce unemployment in France and Italy will likely have a dampening effect on domestic demand in the coming months.</p> <p>While the labour market continues to improve, unemployment is known to be a lagging indicator. Surveys have recently indicated that employers are currently cautious to see how the market turmoil of the beginning of the year is playing out, which could result in more subdued hiring in the months ahead. The momentum of hiring is also not as strong as it was a few months back. The 3-month decline in unemployment has fallen from over half a million in September, to 224 thousand in February. With employers being cautious, this could mean that the relatively high pace of declines in the Eurozone unemployment rate over the past year could be slowing down somewhat in the months ahead. With the unemployment rate still well above its natural rate, that is bad news for price pressures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5702332ce4b0d29fa4d0c60c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-04T09:34:52.373Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone unemployment and producer prices fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More data from the eurozone, with unemployment falling for a thirteenth successive month and producer prices dropping by more than expected in February.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 10.3% but the jobless decline of 39,000 was the smallest drop since last May.</p> <p>Producer prices fell by 0.7% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline.</p> <p>Meanwhile Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank, said it was prepared to ease monetary policy further if inflation remained stubbornly low.

Latest hard data show that construction output disappointingly dipped 0.2% month-on-month and 0.8% in January, marking a soft start to 2016.</p> <p>The government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth almost ground to a halt in March when it was at its weakest level since January 2013 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage.</p> <p>With the corresponding manufacturing survey also weak for March, first quarter GDP growth again looks to have been heavily dependent on the services sector \u2013 so much attention will be focused on the purchasing managers survey for the services sector for March that comes out on Tuesday, especially as the February survey was at a near three-year low.</p> <p>Furthermore, there is not much in the survey to indicate that the construction sector\u2019s fortunes are going to pick up in the near term as it shows orders growth at an 11-,month low, business expectations stuck at the lowest level since December 2014 and employment growth at the lowest level since mid-2013.</p> <p>The construction sector is seemingly currently being affected by increased caution among clients (especially for major projects) amid heightened UK and global economic uncertainties \u2013 and it notable that the purchasing managers indicated that clients are \u201cunwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work\u201d.</p> <p>The looming 23 June referendum on UK membership of the EU adds to the uncertainties dogging the construction sector \u2013 especially given the tightness of opinion polls.</p> <p>On a relatively encouraging note, the purchasing managers reported that \u201csurvey respondents cited a generally supportive economic backdrop\u201d</p> <p>Also on the positive side, there is increasing government support for housebuilding (which needs to see prolonged decent expansion to make genuine inroads into the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage). In November\u2019s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor announced plans to double the housing budget to over \u00a32 billion a year and to build 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid is to start talks with potential buyers for Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations, as the Welsh government and trade unions say the Port Talbot steelworks cannot be allowed to close and warn against any break-up of the business. The beleaguered business secretary will meet with tycoon Sanjeev Gupta on Tuesday morning to discuss the possible sale of Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations, amid warnings that there are only three to four weeks to secure interest. Javid has placed the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) into \u201cfull crisis mode\u201d as he attempts to show that he is taking steps to help Britain\u2019s steel industry, sources have told the Guardian. Trade unions said the government\u2019s handling of the crisis had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Steelworkers made a fresh plea for state support after members of the Community, GMB and Unite trade unions held talks in London. They called on the government to ensure that any buyer invests in modernising Tata\u2019s operations, with as much as \u00a31.5bn needed over 10 years and the state providing support for the first two to three years until the business is self-sufficient. The unions said the government can bypass EU state-aid rules by updating Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnaces and claiming it is investment into research and development, skills, and lowering carbon emissions. They also urged against a break-up of Tata\u2019s business, claiming a blast furnace-only operation in the UK is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. Tony Burke, the assistant general secretary of Unite, said: \u201cIt is clear that last week the government\u2019s eye wasn\u2019t on the ball. It was a disaster. We have got to get the prime minister to intervene. \u201cThere were more questions than answers last week. Now we are looking for answers to the questions.\u201d In Wales, Carwyn Jones, the first minister, told the national assembly that Welsh and British steel \u201ccannot be allowed to die\u201d. Tata Steel is one of the biggest private employers in Wales thanks to its ownership of the Port Talbot steelworks. Jones said there had been early expressions of interest in Tata\u2019s UK operations but called on the Indian firm to allow a realistic timeframe for the sale to go through. \u201cThis should be months, not weeks,\u201d he told the assembly, which has been recalled to deal with the crisis. \u201cAs they prepare to withdraw from Wales, Tata must have regard for its legal and moral responsibilities. Tata has duties and obligations to its workforce and steel communities.\u201d Edwina Hart, the Welsh economy minister, warned against the \u201ccherry-picking\u201d of Tata\u2019s assets. Some potential buyers, including Gupta, who controls metals group Liberty House, have indicated they are only interested in certain parts of Tata\u2019s UK business, such as rolling mills that convert steel into specific products. This raises the prospect of Port Talbot, which is particularly struggling, being ignored by buyers. Hart said: \u201cI think it is quite clear to say that we are concerned to ensure that we don\u2019t fragment the steel industry across the UK. \u201cWe need a viable industry that requires investment and we wouldn\u2019t want people cherry-picking and taking plants out of the equation.\u201d Hart was speaking after chairing a steel taskforce in Cardiff. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gupta said blast furnaces are \u201cmore difficult\u201d to turn around than the rest of the UK steel industry. \u201cWhat is more difficult is the blast furnaces, the liquid end of the steelmaking. \u201cThe UK imports all its raw material. That wasn\u2019t the case when this plant [Port Talbot] was set up. Then the raw material was produced domestically. Now we import iron ore and coal. We import nearly three tonnes of material to make one tonne of steel. \u201cThere are two solutions to this problem. Either we import slabs ... or alternatively there is a homegrown solution, which is tougher, which is that we use domestically available scrap. UK exports nearly 7m tonnes of scrap. That could be all turned into steel. \u201cYou have to close down blast furnaces, not overnight, it is a transition. But you have to close the blast furnaces and erect arc furnaces. It is a major investment programme. It is tougher. But it is a solution.\u201d The UK government is trying to reorganise after it was caught out by Tata\u2019s announcement last week that it planned to sell off its UK assets, putting 15,000 jobs at risk at the company itself and a further 25,000 jobs in the supply chain. Javid\u2019s meeting with Gupta is one of a series being held by the business secretary as he tries to fend off claims that he has been sidelined by David Cameron after a slow initial response to the crisis. The prime minister will meet with Carwyn Jones on Tuesday. However, a source said it was \u201cnot true\u201d that Javid was not in control of the situation, claiming he had ensured his staff were working around the clock. Javid met senior directors inside his department on Monday, and is due to meet Tata\u2019s Europe team along with the Cabinet Office minister, Oliver Letwin, and the chancellor, George Osborne. BIS said there were plans for \u201ccontinuous engagement\u201d until a buyer was secured. However, the Welsh first minister called on the UK government to put nationalisation on the table. They must \u201ctake the plants into public ownership until a buyer can be found\u201d, he said, adding that the Welsh government would contribute from its resources. \u201cThe current situation has been created by distorted conditions in the global steel market, and not by any inefficiency on the part of the workforce,\u201d Jones added. He sounded a positive note about potential buyers. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to one potential buyer this morning. How we deal with these expressions of interest is the substance of our joint work with the UK government.\u201d A small group of parties interested in buying sites from Tata have emerged. However, they would all need significant support from the government and it is doubtful whether they would want to buy the entire business or Port Talbot itself. These parties include Liberty House and investment firm Greybull. These businesses are already buying assets from Tata \u2013 Greybull is close to acquiring its Scunthorpe steelworks and could also revive the British Steel brand by buying it from Tata. Another potential saviour is ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. ThyssenKrupp was in talks to buy Port Talbot and Tata\u2019s other UK sites as part of a deal to buy its European business, including a major steelworks in the Netherlands. However, talks broke down about three months ago over concerns about the mounting losses in the UK and its pension liabilities of \u00a315bn. The dire financial situation facing Tata\u2019s UK steel business makes the prospect of any rescue deal difficult. It is understood that Tata Steel is losing \u00a32.5m a day in the UK, up from the \u00a31m figure first reported, and that it will lose at least \u00a3100m in running a sales process until the end of April.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser saw his pay package almost double last year to more than \u00a323m. Rakesh Kapoor\u2019s pay soared thanks to a share-based bonus linked to the performance of the company behind brands such as Nurofen and Durex. The bumper package catapults Kapoor, who has been with Reckitt Benckiser for almost three decades, close to the top of the league table of Britain\u2019s highest paid chief executives. But he still lags behind the boss of the advertising firm WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell, who was given a deal worth \u00a363m last year thanks to a share award. Kapoor\u2019s pay is also dwarfed by the sums enjoyed by his predecessor at Reckitt, Bart Becht, who infamously pocketed a deal worth some \u00a390m in 2010. But the scale of Kapoor\u2019s award drew criticism from a thinktank that monitors pay packages on offer in the upper echelons of British firms. High Pay Centre spokesman Stefan Stern singled out an \u00a318m share-based long term incentive payment (LTIP) to Kapoor for performance over three years to end of 2015. \u201cWe think these LTIPs are hopelessly flawed instruments. They\u2019re for three years, which isn\u2019t really long term, so they\u2019re badly named.They are clearly skewed if they can generate results like this, with a near 100% increase in package. \u201cIs the company 100% better than it was? Are employees 100% better off than they were? There\u2019s clearly a gross distortion of one individual, who seems to be extracting extraordinary rewards.\u201d According to Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s annual report, published on Monday, Kapoor was paid 80% of the total LTIP available to him, compared with 40% last year. This had the effect of increasing his share-based payment from \u00a38.9m to \u00a318.17m, on top of a basic salary of \u00a3891,000, bonus of \u00a33.8m and pension payments and benefits worth \u00a3300.000. The LTIP share bonus is determined by earnings per share, which increased by more than 8% a year over the three years to the end of 2015, when adjusted for currency movements. That compares with an increase of 6.1% a year during the previous LTIP period, which triggered just 40% of Kapoor\u2019s potential payout under the scheme. Reckitt said he had only enjoyed such an increase in pay because the company\u2019s performance has improved, delivering returns for investors. It said investors\u2019 returns over the three-year period amounted to \u00a321bn in share price increase, dividends and value created by the demerger of Reckitt\u2019s pharmaceutical division, now known as Indivior. The company said \u00a3100 invested in Reckitt on 1 January 2013 was worth \u00a3179 by the end of 2015, compared with \u00a3118 if the investment had been spread across the rest of the FTSE 100index. The Reckitt share price has increased from just under \u00a333 when Kapoor took over in September 2011 to \u00a367.50. But investors have previously criticised the company over its pay policy, with 43% of them failing to back the 2013 remuneration report, which led to Kapoor being paid \u00a36.6m. The company has since consulted investors on how to link pay and performance more closely together. Kapoor has also sought to show off his cost-cutting credentials by giving up business class flights on journeys of less than six hours. In 2012, Reckitt admitted it had failed to disclose that he pledged more than \u00a36m of his shares in the company against a loan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilding in Britain slowed last month to the weakest pace for more than three years as construction firms said an uncertain outlook had curbed spending among clients. The slowdown in home construction overshadowed faster rises in commercial work and civil engineering activity and left overall growth in the building sector subdued, according to a survey. The headline reading on the latest Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) was 54.2, unchanged from February\u2019s 10-month low. That was above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion in output. The survey authors highlighted that growth in housebuilding activity was only \u201cmarginal\u201d and the weakest since January 2013. For the construction sector as a whole, there was also a slowdown in new business growth and employment eased to its slowest expansion rate for almost three years. The report did not mention the upcoming EU referendum, but did draw parallels between the current business mood and the run-up to last year\u2019s general election. \u201cThere was little comfort to be had this month, as the construction sector was awash with caution and hesitancy not seen since the pre-election lull of 2015,\u201d said David Noble, group chief executive at co-authors the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. \u201cClients were unwilling to commit to new contracts or expand existing work, meaning that new business growth was at its most fragile since April 2015.\u201d The survey of purchasing managers at more than 170 construction firms found they thought the economic backdrop was \u201cgenerally supportive\u201d but some \u201cnoted that greater uncertainty about the business outlook had resulted in more cautious spending patterns among clients\u201d. The cautious tone in the construction survey echoes a poll of company finance bosses published earlier on Monday showing they were becoming more risk averse ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June. Economists warn that a drop in business and consumer confidence ahead of the public vote could dent economic growth in the near-term. There will be fresh clues on the economic health of the UK on Tuesday when Markit publishes its PMI report for the services sector, by far the biggest part of the economy.",

      "bodyText": "An attempt by the operators of a $34bn gas project to walk away from environmental commitments has stalled, as the federal government waits for it to provide \u201csufficient evidence\u201d in support of the request. The company, Inpex, claimed the originally assessed environmental risks of its Ichthys project were \u201cno longer relevant and extremely unlikely to be realised in the future\u201d. It had therefore requested the federal government vary its agreement and scratch offset obligations. The Northern Territory Environmental Defender\u2019s Office on Friday described the move as \u201cradically premature\u201d. In a statement to Guardian Australia on Monday, the federal environment department said it had not yet made a decision on Inpex\u2019s request, first lodged in October, because it was yet to receive further documentation it had requested from Inpex. \u201cA decision will be made on the application when there is sufficient scientific evidence to evaluate Inpex\u2019s request,\u201d it said. The project was given environmental approval under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2011 on the basis of its $91m environmental offset program. The offsets ranged from research projects to large conservation areas and spanned both construction and the 40-year operational lifetime. That operational phase is yet to begin but Inpex has said its impact is less than projected and some offsets \u2013 reported to be worth more than $30m \u2013 were no longer needed. \u201cThis is due to world-class environmental management and a significant investment of time, money and people resources,\u201d said Sean Kildare, Inpex\u2019s Darwin general manager. Among the projects believed to be at risk are the establishment of large conservation areas and a Western Top End marine megafauna project that would have created jobs, training and expertise for Indigenous residents. The Northern Territory government, a partner in the project, is refusing to comment on whether it supports Inpex\u2019s proposal. The deputy chief minister, minister for business and minister for employment and training, Peter Styles, on Monday said he was not across the agreement made between Inpex and the government because of its size. \u201cThere\u2019s two years\u2019 worth of consultation in those contracts, 29 different financial institutions across the world and probably the volumes would fill half of this room,\u201d he told media in Darwin. Styles dismissed concerns that the agreement could allow Inpex to walk away from environmental commitments just five years into a 45-year project. \u201cI believe that everyone has the right to make applications for all sorts of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat comes out of that is a different story altogether. As a government I don\u2019t think we should stop anyone from actually putting forward ideas.\u201d He said the Country Liberal Party had offered bipartisan support when the project was first proposed under the previous Labor government, a claim Labor immediately refuted. Styles referred multiple questions to the NT environment minister, Gary Higgins. Higgins declined to be interviewed but said in a statement it was a matter for the federal government \u201cand we trust they will assess the proposal based on the facts and the science\u201d. \u201cThe Ichthys project has and continues to deliver a range of benefits to the Territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThe project has invested in world-class environmental monitoring and practices to ensure that any environmental impacts are monitored, mitigated and prevented.\u201d The NT government was made aware of the Inpex proposal through media reports. The NT opposition leader, Michael Gunner, said it was his hope that Inpex would stick to its original agreement. \u201cThe community expectations are that Inpex would protect the environment like they promised,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The British Steel name is set for a comeback even as the future of the UK\u2019s biggest steel plant at Port Talbot hangs in the balance. Greybull Capital, an investment firm, is close to completing the purchase of Tata Steel\u2019s long products steelworks in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. As part of the talks, disclosed in December, Greybull is seeking to buy the British Steel brand. Tata Steel acquired the name when it bought British Steel\u2019s former business in 2007 in the acquisition of the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus. The Indian company now plans to pull out of the UK entirely and is looking for a buyer for its blast furnace in Port Talbot, Wales, and other plants. British Steel was formed in 1967 when the then Labour government nationalised the industry. It was sold off by the Thatcher government in 1988 and merged with Koninklijke Hoogovens of the Netherlands to form Corus in 1999. Greybull is said to want to revive the brand because of its simplicity, resonance and association with quality, despite British Steel\u2019s mixed record and history of industrial strife under state ownership. The heavy metal band Judas Priest released the album British Steel in April 1980, shortly after a three-month strike by the company\u2019s workers secured a 16% pay rise. If Greybull acquires the brand, it would not be available to a potential buyer for the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business. Government ministers are sounding out possible purchasers and have asked Tata to keep the loss-making business operating while a buyer is found. Greybull has not ruled out bidding for other parts of Tata\u2019s business, including Port Talbot, though the steelmaking plant, with 15,000 workers, is larger and riskier than the Scunthorpe long products business, which turns steel into railway tracks and components used in construction. A source familiar with Greybull said the firm was not in explicit talks about Port Talbot and was concentrating on completing the Scunthorpe deal. Any involvement in rescuing Port Talbot could depend on finding investment partners and the level of government support on offer. A spokesman for Greybull declined to comment on whether the firm was considering further purchases from Tata Steel but said \u201ctalks are still ongoing and constructive\u201d about the Scunthorpe plant. ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate, emerged as a possible buyer for Port Talbot over the weekend. It was reported on Sunday evening that Sanjeev Gupta, the boss of Liberty House Group, had begun preliminary talks with Tata. Liberty House last month bought two Lanarkshire mills from Tata Steel in a deal brokered by the Scottish government. Greybull had initially considered buying those plants as well as Scunthorpe. Union leaders are due to meet on Monday to plan their next moves in the battle to save the steel industry, which has been damaged by falling prices, high energy costs and a glut of cheap Chinese steel. Roy Rickhuss, the leader of the Community union, said: \u201cThis meeting will be a key moment in our campaign. We have an entire industry to save and not a lot of time to save it. We must also ensure that we hold Tata to a commitment to be a responsible seller and honour its moral and social duties to UK steel communities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government\u2019s approval of leases for Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, Australia\u2019s largest proposed coal project, was \u201ceconomic stupidity and environmental insanity\u201d, a protest rally heard on Monday. The Queensland Greens Senate candidate and former Australian Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett told the demonstration outside Queensland\u2019s parliament house the approval could jeopardise the Greens preferences that had helped bring the Palaszczuk government to power. About 150 people gathered in Brisbane on Monday morning to voice opposition to the mine, which still faces legal challenges from conservationists and traditional owners. Approval of the leases was Adani\u2019s final major regulatory hurdle but the Indian conglomerate has said its final decision on the investment, which the government now puts at $21bn, will be made after the outcome of those cases. Adani Australia\u2019s Indian parent has previously said the project is on hold while the coal market is in a slump. The crowd chanted \u201creef not coal\u201d before being addressed by speakers including Bartlett. Bartlett said the advent of the Carmichael mine, which would ship up to 60m tonnes of coal a year to Asia, gave a \u201ctoehold\u201d for other Galilee basin miners, which could lead to a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d of global environmental significance. Bartlett told Guardian Australia he was aware of members of the Palaszczuk government, including in cabinet, \u201cwho know this is a really bad idea, who are quietly hoping it will fall over, but just don\u2019t want to say stuff because of the politics\u201d. \u201cI heard this thing that Labor\u2019s letting it all go ahead but still expecting it to fall over economically and obviously any way that it stops is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a huge gamble to be playing with everybody\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start transitioning the economy and we have to be sending that clear message. \u201cIt is insane to be looking to open up any new coalmines in Queensland, let alone ones as huge as this that will open up a monumentally large deposit. \u201cUnless governments can be upfront with people about that, you can never expect people to fully take in just how serious this situation is. \u201cOf course there\u2019s political sensitivities there for the government but they are in there on the votes of Greens voters who gave them a very strong flow of preferences because of promises such as putting the reef first.\u201d Lisa Signa Jamieson, an Australian Samoan activist with the group Pacific Island Warriors, came to the rally from a youth conference in Fiji where she said the Adani approvals made ripples. Jamieson said her group was considering at length protest action to \u201cdirectly target the fossil fuel industry\u201d. She said the Carmichael mine was firmly on the radar of Pacific leaders whose nations were most directly threatened by climate change. \u201cThese island nations are against any new mines,\u201d she said. Nic Kennedy travelled to the rally with her three young children. \u201cThe reef is dying and it\u2019s dying before our very eyes and it doesn\u2019t need to be that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been so many signs and so much research yet both the ALP and LNP are failing us.\u201d The Australian Conservation Foundation has challenged federal environmental approval of the project in a federal court case that may not be decided until next year. Some traditional owners of the mine site, members of the Wangan and Jagalingou people, have also sought a federal court review of a native tribunal ruling that the mine can go ahead without their consent because the project is in the public interest.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s always a moment when you know you have reached a certain age: it may be the fact that your kids are now in a school year that you can remember with alarming clarity; it may be that when you fill in an online survey you find yourself ticking the age bracket box that no longer starts with a three. For me, it was realising that the latest series of the ABS\u2019s retirement intention survey includes those who where just 22 when Nirvana released Nevermind. The 45-year olds in 2014-15 are those who are smack bang in the middle of the Gen X era. They\u2019ve gone from grunge and screaming out the chorus of Killing in the Name at 21st birthday parties to realising, as they sit on their couch catching up on episodes of Game of Thrones, that they are going to work till they die. Well at least it might feel that way. The latest data on retirement intention reveals that Generation X are intending to work longer than any generation before it. One in five workers aged 45-49 intend to work beyond 70 years of age \u2013 up from the mere 5% of that age bracket in 2004-05. In the May 2014 budget the then Treasurer Joe Hockey announced that the retirement age would be raised to 70 years by 2035 \u2013 rather nicely only affecting those who were born after 1965, thus missing the baby boomer generation and hitting their Gen X children. The policy was one of the many from that budget that failed to get through parliament \u2013 and the Department of Human Services page still has the measure \u201csubject to passage of legislation\u201d. But regardless, those born after 1965 are already resigning themselves to the need to work at least till that age \u2013 and beyond. The increase is not merely limited to the Gen Xers. Those aged 55-59 also saw a jump in the numbers of those intending to work well past the current retirement age. One of the biggest concerns regarding increasing the retirement age to 70 is that while such an age may be fine for some workers, many \u2013 especially those who perform manual labour \u2013 would be physically unable to work at that age. Certainly the figures suggest that for those who do intend to work until that age, the physical ability to do so is a major factor. Thirty six percent of those over 45 who intend to work beyond 70 years of age cite personal health and physical abilities as the major reason for their decision to do so. Overall however the major factor that determines the age at which people will retire is financial security: The figures also show that, as a rule, women intend to retire earlier: Women are also more likely to intend working till retirement with their current employer. Of the 1.87m people over 45 who intend to retire and know whether they will work full or part time until they retire (some 624,000 don\u2019t know), 81% of women intend to either work full or part time with their current employer. By contrast 74% of men intend to do so: But while the most common intention is to stay working full-time, 13% of both men and women who intend to stay with their current employer also hope to reduce their duties and/or responsibilities, and 39% of those who intend to change employers hope to reduce their responsibilities. Six percent of those who intend staying with their current employer intend to work more from home, compared to 20% of those who intend to change employers \u2013 suggesting that as the population ages, being able to offer more flexible working arrangements will be a key towards staff retention. And staff retention is going to be a major concern as the changing demographic continues to see a greater proportion of those over the age of 65 within the labour force. Back in 2004, when only 5% of those aged 45-49 thought they would work till 70, a mere 6.5% of those over 65 years of age were in the labour force \u2013 now it is close to 13%: This proportion is unlikely to fall \u2013 especially as the increase in the retirement age to 67 only begins to take effect from July next year. As the proportion of workers aged closer to the retirement age continues to grow, employers will need to adjust their work practices to keep valuable staff and to adapt to the realities of the demographics. But while the results of the survey would appear to suggest that retirement has become but a dream, it remains a goal for the vast majority of workers. In 2014-15 only 20.6% of workers either did not intend to retire or did not know whether they would retire \u2013 down from 20.9% in 2012-13: Gen Xers and those getting ever closer to the retirement age may have resigned themselves to having to working longer, but they remain as hopeful as any who came before them that the day when they can put their feet up will arrive.",
