      "bodyText": "The CBI has issued a call on eurozone leaders to quickly resolve the Greek debt crisis, whatever the outcome of Sunday\u2019s referendum, after the British business group\u2019s latest poll highlighted mounting pressure on exporters. The lobby group said its surveys of more than 750 companies across the manufacturing, retail and service sectors suggested UK economic growth lost momentum last month. The CBI reported a drop to +14% from +33% in May for its growth indicator, which represents the net balance of those businesses reporting a pick-up in output versus those reporting a fall. The group was recently forced to cut its outlook for the UK economy this year after official figures showed a slowdown in the opening months. It expects the economy to have performed better in the second quarter and said the latest growth indicator pointed to \u201csolid\u201d activity in that April-June period. Furthermore, businesses were optimistic growth would bounce back in the next three months. But CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, echoed reports from UK exporters of pressures on sales to their biggest market, the eurozone, from a strong pound against the troubled euro. \u201cWe expect the economy to sustain a solid pace of growth over the remainder of the year as lower oil prices and inflation continue to boost real incomes and consumer spending,\u201d said Newton-Smith. \u201cBut exporters face real challenges, especially from the impact of a stronger pound against the euro and still weak global export markets. And whatever the results of the referendum in Greece, we urge eurozone leaders to move quickly towards a deal that underpins both growth and financial stability, providing certainty for Greece and the wider eurozone.\u201d The concerns around Greece\u2019s potential exit from the eurozone and the region\u2019s economic prospects were also reflected in a slowdown in hiring in Britain\u2019s dominant service sector, according to a separate business survey published on Friday. The sector, which spans hotels to banks, enjoyed a pick-up in activity boding well for the wider economy, according to the closely watched Markit/Cips UK services PMI. The poll\u2019s main activity index bounced back to 58.5 in June from 56.5 in May, beating economists forecasts for a reading of 57.4 and well above the 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction. But the sector created new jobs at the slowest pace for six months as growth in new business also eased off. \u201cHiring and inflows of new business both slowed in June, and an escalating Greek crisis and \u2018Grexit\u2019 has the potential to destabilise economic growth,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. But overall, the survey still pointed to a pick-up in UK economic growth, to 0.5% in the second quarter from 0.4% in the first three months of the year; that may well prompt the Bank of England to start raising rates from their record low, Williamson added. \u201cWhile uncertainty caused by the Greek debt crisis rules out any imminent hike in interest rates, the post-election rebound in service sector business activity adds to the likelihood of the Bank of England starting to nudge rates higher later this year,\u201d he said. Markets, however, are not pricing in a shift up from 0.5% base rates until 2016 and earlier this week Bank chief economist Andy Haldane said the next move could just as easily be down as up. He warned raising interest rates too soon could be a self-defeating move that tips the UK back into recession.",

    "webTitle": "Greek debt crisis: referendum to go ahead as court rejects appeal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s top court has overruled an appeal from two Greek citizens against the decision to hold a referendum on Greece\u2019s latest bailout package, clearing the vote to go ahead on Sunday. Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Athens for two rallies, held by the yes and no camps. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras addressed the latter, urging his supporters to express a \u201cproud no to ultimatums and those who terrorise you\u201d. He then tweeted that Greece will be sending a \u201cmessage of democracy and dignity to Europe and the world\u201d. Rallies showing solidarity with Greece\u2019s anti-austerity movement are also being held in other European countries, including several German cities and Rome. Earlier on Friday, Tsipras said Thursday\u2019s IMF report, which called for debt relief and a 20-year grace period, vindicated the Greek government. According to reports, the US pushed for the report to be published, against European resistance. European council president Donald Tusk has sought to calm the waters between Greece and its creditors by saying that Sunday\u2019s referendum in Greece is not a vote on euro membership. It emerged that Greek banks have a buffer of \u20ac1bn \u2013 enough cash to last them until Monday, when the European Central Bank will decide whether to increase loans to Greek banks. The latest polling, just two days before the vote, puts the two camps almost neck and neck - \u201ctoo close to call\u201d, according to Ipsos. An Ipsos poll just released shows the referendum on a knife-edge. It has yes on 44% and no one point behind on 43%, with 12% still undecided. The number of undecided respondents underscores the significant potential for volatility, Ipsos said, describing the referendum as \u201ctoo close to call\u201d. The poll is the fifth to be released on Friday, with the fourth also giving a narrow lead to the yes camp. It also shows that, regardless of where they place their own support, more Greeks believe that the yes side will win than think victory will be handed to the no camp. There are suggestions that the US pushed for the IMF report to be published this week, overcoming opposition from Europe. Here\u2019s the Reuters exclusive: Eurozone countries tried in vain to stop the IMF publishing a gloomy analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden which the leftist government says vindicates its call to voters to reject bailout terms, sources familiar with the situation said on Friday. The document released in Washington on Thursday said Greece\u2019s public finances will not be sustainable without substantial debt relief, possibly including write-offs by European partners of loans guaranteed by taxpayers. It also said Greece will need at least \u20ac50bn in additional aid over the next three years to keep itself afloat. Publication of the draft Debt Sustainability Analysis laid bare a dispute between Brussels and the Washington-based global lender that has been simmering behind closed doors for months. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cited the report in a televised appeal to voters on Friday to say \u2018No\u2019 to the proposed austerity terms, which have anyway expired since talks broke down and Athens defaulted on an IMF loan this week. It was not clear whether an arcane IMF document would influence a cliffhanger poll in which Greece\u2019s future in the euro zone is at stake with banks closed, cash withdrawals rationed and commerce seizing up. \u201cYesterday an event of major political importance happened,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cThe IMF published a report on Greece\u2019s economy which is a great vindication for the Greek government as it confirms the obvious - that Greek debt is not sustainable.\u201d At a meeting on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s board on Wednesday, European members questioned the timing of the report which IMF management proposed at short notice releasing three days before Sunday\u2019s crucial referendum that may determine the country\u2019s future in the euro zone, the sources said. There was no vote but the Europeans were heavily outnumbered and the United States, the strongest voice in the IMF, was in favor of publication, the sources said. The Europeans were also concerned that the report could distract attention from a view they share with the IMF that the Tsipras government, in the five months since it was elected, has wrecked a fragile economy that was just starting to recover. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision,\u201d an IMF source involved in the debate over publication said. \u201cWe are not living in an ivory tower here. But the EU has to understand that not everything can be decided based on their own imperatives.\u201d The board had considered all arguments, including the risk that the document would be politicized, but the prevailing view was that all the evidence and figures should be laid out transparently before the referendum. \u201cFacts are stubborn. You can\u2019t hide the facts because they may be exploited,\u201d the IMF source said. IMF spokeswoman Angela Gaviria declined to comment on this report. Helena Smith says: The mayor of Athens George Kaminis has addressed the yes rally. He has delivered a withering critique of the government accusing it of lies and obsfucation. \u201cThey say they will reach a deal in 48 hours when no one is talking to them,\u201d he has just told the crowd. Over at the no rally, prime minister Alexis Tsipras addressed ecstatic supporters. He kicked off his speech saying: \u201cToday we are not protesting, today we are celebrating democracy, today we are celebrating the victory of democracy, whatever the result is on Monday. Today all of Europe has its eyes on you, the Greek people and on the three million impoverished Greeks. The whole planet has its eyes turned on Syntagma square in the place where democracy was born.\u201d The leftist firebrand then turned his fire on creditors. \u201cNo one has the right to threaten to divide Europe,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWe will tell them noon Sunday.\u201d Tellingly the prime minister\u2019s speech was not relayed in its entirety by television channels. The media has not been shy about showing its political colours: they have avidly thrown their weight behind the yes vote. He urged voters to express a \u201cproud \u2018No\u2019 to ultimatums and those who terrorise you.\u201d That ends his short speech - and the concert restarts. The Greek prime minister has told supporters that whatever happens over the weekend, this is a celebration of democracy. He said Greeks are determined to take matters into their own hands. Sunday\u2019s referendum is about staying in Europe, and deciding to live with dignity in Europe, he said. Tsipras, dressed in a white shirt, has just walked up on stage and is waving to the crowd. Helena Smith in Athens writes: Sunday\u2019s referendum has, almost overnight, turned into a fight for political survival for Syriza. The anti-austerity movement that took Europe by storm, when it was swept into power on the back of popular discontent in January, now faces an existential battle. \u201cIn Europe they want to squelch us because they only want one policy, the doctrine of neo-liberalism, to succeed,\u201d the administrative reform minister Giorgos Katrougalos said earlier today. There is growing acceptance that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 high-stakes gamble calling the referendum may well backfire. The \u201cyes\u201d vote has swelled in recent days as big name political and cultural figures have come out in support. If the outcome on Sunday is a massive turnout in support for the \u201cyes\u201d vote, it will augur political developments with Tsipras and his radical left Syriza party possibly even having to step down on Monday. If the vote is \u201cno,\u201d as the government has urged, Athens\u2019 relationship will break down further. \u201cThey have made it clear Schauble, Merkel, and others that they don\u2019t want to deal with us,\u201d one minister told me requesting anonymity. \u201cIt is very difficult to say if we will be here on Monday. A lot is in Tsipras\u2019 hands. Our biggest concern, now, is the division we are seeing [between the two camps] and how we are going to handle it.\u201d Speculation was rampant on Friday that in the event of a resounding \u2018yes\u2019 a national unity government might have to be formed after the referendum possibly led by technocrats or figures outside the political arena. Athens\u2019 mayor George Kaminis, a professor of constitutional law and Yannis Boutaris, the mayor of Thessakoniki, are possibilities. \u201cIt is very difficult to see a better agreement [emerging with creditors] in the event of a \u2018no\u2019 vote,\u201d said the political commentator Alexis Papahelas. \u201cA \u2018yes\u2019 vote is going to be difficult and the Europeans have made a lot of mistakes but it will at least keep us at the core of Europe.\u201d The \u2018No\u2019 rally has turned into a music festival, punctuated by cries of \u2018Ochi\u2019. Everyone is singing along now. More from Jon Henley in Athens: Most people stressed they were not voting against the EU, or for a Grexit: \u201cJust against this EU, said Malvina, 27, an engineering student. \u201cWe want the right Europe. One where all countries are equal, and treated with respect. I hope a No vote will give Tsipras a stronger position in the negotiations \u2013 that\u2019s all.\u201d But if Greece did end up quitting, said Christos Mellios, who owns a small plastics factory, \u201cmaybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing. It would be good for all of Europe to change. I don\u2019t think anyone actually likes this Europe, what Europe has become.\u201d His partner, Mania Epithimiades, said she had had \u201cenough, five years of austerity, it\u2019s enough. We\u2019d like to have our dignity back, our pride and our freedom. And we\u2019re not afraid.\u201d Nick, a civil servant, and his partner Christina, doing a masters degree in informatics, also said their vote was intended to strengthen the leftist prime minister\u2019s hand at whatever negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors follow the referendum. \u201cThey have to understand we won\u2019t get out of this unless we get some debt relief,\u201d said Nick. \u201cAnd that we have the right to decide for ourselves, implement a different economic policy. They can\u2019t just dictate the way we run our country.\u201d Christina said her No vote would be \u201cagainst the way Europe \u2013 some people, at the top of Europe \u2013 has handled this whole story. We hope our actions will set an example for the whole of Europe. There is some union support in Germany for the Greek anti-austerity camp: Tsipras is making his way through the crowd at the \u2018No\u2019 rally. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just emerged from his office - smiling in white shirt and slacks - and is about to walk to Syntagma (a ten-minute stroll) to address the crowd, Helena Smith reports. Police are estimating both crowds at around 20,000 each, reports John Hooper from Athens. The comments come from an interview with Politico. You can read the interview in full here. The European Council president sought to lower the temperature on the Greek crisis, calling on Athens and its creditors to stop the mutual \u201cblame game,\u201d work to \u201crebuild trust\u201d and quickly return to the negotiating table after Sunday\u2019s referendum. The main aim for us is to keep the eurozone united. Tusk said the EU will work with Athens regardless of Sunday\u2019s outcome, though if the Greeks vote Yes, I think it\u2019s a chance to open a new chapter in negotiations, perhaps more promising than before.\u201d More from Donald Tusk, courtesy of Reuters. Striking a conciliatory note, the European Council president said if Greeks vote \u2018No\u2019 to the bailout package there will be less room for negotiations but the aim remains to keep the eurozone united. He added: Maybe we will have to get used to living with a country as a member of the eurozone in bankruptcy. Jon Henley has spoken to protesters at the \u2018No\u2019 rally in Athens. \u201cI\u2019m here to shout No at the top of my voice,\u201d said Panos Stathopoulos, a recently retired dentist. \u201cNo to austerity, no to this European Union that seems to have no sentiment, nothing.\u201d Sporting a red-and-white OXI sticker, Stathopoulos said after five years of austerity: \u201cThey know the situation very well, and still they keep trying to impose these measures on the weakest of us \u2013 I\u2019m sorry for the founding fathers of the EU, I don\u2019t think they ever envisaged a Europe like this.\u201d Friends and colleagues Eri, Constantina and Marta \u2013 all psychologists \u2013 said they had come because \u201cwe want to have hope.\u201d They would vote No on Sunday because \u201cwe want to be able to express our own opinions, and to decide for ourselves, in our own country,\u201d said Eri.\u201cWe want to have hope hope for ourselves, for our children and for our country. At the moment, we decide nothing. We suffer what others decide for us. They have to realise that can\u2019t be right.\u201d News flash on Reuters: Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, says the Greek referendum is NOT a vote on whether the country should stay in the euro. Meanwhile, crowds supporting the \u2018No\u2019 campaign are also swelling in Syntagama square, reports Helena Smith. SKAI TV is showing demonstrators packed into the square and spilling out into surrounding streets. The cries of \u201cOxi\u201d [No in Greek] have wafted from loud speakers all the way into Plaka, Athens\u2019 old town, from where I write these lines. Anticipation is mounting ahead of prime minister Alexis Tsipras addressing the crowd at 9pm. Many are holding placards denouncing the \u201cbarbaric austerity\u201d imposed on Greece at the behest of international creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF for the past five years. Some of the country\u2019s most popular singers, musicians, composers and actors are in attendance and will host a concert after the rally in what the leftist-led government has defiantly called a \u2018festival of the people.\u2019 Tonight\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 rallies depict in very dramatic form the dangerous divide now taking hold of Greece \u2013 between those who favour reform and see themselves as pro-European, pro-western and pro-modernisation and those who say the country can no longer bear any more of the self-defeating austerity that has brought so many to their knees. Big crowds are waiting for Tsipras to speak, around 9pm local time (7pm London time). Live music first from various bands. You can watch the \u2018No\u2019 rally live here. Here\u2019s more on the \u2018Yes\u2019 rally, from Helena Smith in Athens. Aerial views of the two huge rallies currently taking place in Athens are being projected from helicopters hired by local TV stations. Panoramic images relayed by Skai TV are showing a HUGE crowd of Yes voters gathered around Athens\u2019 marble Kalimarmaro stadium. Many are holding Greek flags and placards proclaiming \u201cyes to Greece, yes to the euro.\u201d Some are also screaming \u201cresign\u201d \u201cresign\u201d at the leftist-led government. The \u201cyes\u201d [NAI in Greek] campaign, which has won wide support from leading politicians in recent days (and is backed by nearly all of Greece\u2019s big, business-owned media channels) argues that the country should be kept in the euro at any cost. Ironically, many Greeks who are no fans of the political opposition [backing the Yes campaign] and cast ballots in favour of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party in January, are now supporting the Yes campaign for fear that Athens\u2019 relationship with Europe might otherwise be irreparably damaged. \u201cI will be voting yes with a heavy heart but there is no other way,\u201d said Anna Papandreou in what has become a commonly expressed sentiment in recent days. More rallies abroad... in Berlin And, finally, a pic from the \u2018Yes\u2019 rally in Athens... Interesting age breakdown. Other rallies in Cologne and Frankfurt in Germany and Glasgow express sympathy with anti-austerity protesters in Greece. Meanwhile, US senators have written to IMF chief Christine Lagarde warning of the consequences for the fund if there is no satisfactory solution for Greece. Back to the protests... Potential costs of Greek default, calculated by RBS using official figures: This placard tells Germany\u2019s finance minister to \u201cgo to hell\u201d. Looks like the protesters involved in scuffles with police are anarchists. Other reports suggest rally is peaceful. Greek police threw stun grenades as they clashed with protesters at the \u2018No\u2019 rally, Reuters reports. The scuffles involved a few dozen people, many dressed in black and wearing helmets, but it appears things have calmed down. The \u2018No\u2019 rally in Syntagma Square in Athens has got under way. Over in Athens, bankers contacted by the Guardian are expressing grave doubts that lenders will be fully functioning next week. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports There is almost no ATM in central Athens, as I write, that does not have a huddle of people, cards to the ready, in front of it. This is the beginning of what was meant to be another record year of tourist arrivals and many of those now lining up around cash dispensers are holidaymakers (or journalists as the very heart of the Greek capital has also been taken over by a media circus). And therein lies the problem: by Monday ATMs will have run out of the very cash Greece so badly needs precisely because demands far outstrips supply and stocks are running out fast. \u201cI have very grave doubts as to whether banks will open on Tuesday and even if they do there will be no cash transactions,\u201d one banker confided. \u201cI have seen directors at the Bank of Greece in a state of panic because our liquidity buffer is being eaten up and without the [bailout] programme there\u2019s no ELA [emergency liquidity assistance]. We are in a real mess.\u201d With capital controls in place, many fear it could be months before they are fully lifted, with potentially devastating repercussions for the economy. \u201cThe situation is very serious,\u201d the president of the national confederation of Hellenic Commerce Vasillis Korkidis told me earlier. \u201cNow that they are in place capital controls may last for a year. The cap on cash withdrawals will probably be raised (from \u20ac60 per day) but other restrictions vould remain in place. We saw what happened to Cyprus where it took two years before controls were lifted.\u201d As we reported earlier today the Greek finance minister himself said \u201cpaper money\u201d had become a problem. If banks run out of cash before Sunday\u2019s referendum it could have a devastating effect on the \u201cno\u201d vote, analysts say. \u201cThe site of ATMs running out of cash before Sunday would destroy the no vote,\u201d said the prominent political commentatos Aristides Hatzis. \u201cThe \u201cyes\u201d would win with a landslide which is why the government is insisting and I think praying that everything will be OK at least until Monday.\u201d Greece\u2019s top administrative court has rejected an appeal by two Greek citizens against Sunday\u2019s referendum on the country\u2019s bailout package, as just reported. A bit more detail, courtesy of Reuters: \u201cRejected,\u201d said the presiding judge in Greece\u2019s Council of State court Nikolaos Sakellariou. \u201cThe referendum will be held.\u201d Pollsters say the vote is too close to call. The news has boosted the euro, which has risen to $1.107 within minutes, from $1.1094. European stock markets have closed, ending the day slightly lower. FTSE 100 index in London down 44.69 points, or 0.67%, at 6585.78 Dax in Frankfurt down 40.96 points, or 0.37%, at 11,058.39 CAC in Paris down 27.34 points, or 0.57%, at 4808.22 Ibex in Madrid down 66.60 points, or 0.6%, at 10,779.80 FTSE MiB in Milan down 108.37 points, or 0.48%, at 22,508.13 The Athens stock market has been closed all week. Greece\u2019s top administrative court has rejected the appeal to suspend Sunday\u2019s referendum, Reuters reports, citing court officials. Another opinion poll, from the Proto Thema website, shows the \u2018Yes\u2019 camp at 41.7% while the \u2018No\u2019 camp is at 41.1% and 10.7% are undecided. The poll was conducted by Alco on behalf of the Proto Thema newspaper. We are still waiting for a decision from Greece\u2019s top court on whether Sunday\u2019s referendum is legal... and there are two big rallies scheduled for tonight, both in Syntagma Square in Athens. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to speak at the \u2018No\u2019 rally. The \u20ac60 daily cash withdrawal limit remains unchanged, Reuters reported, citing officials following a meeting between banking officials and the government\u2019s economics team. There had been suggestions that it might be reduced to \u20ac20 if banks run out of money. Yiannis Dragasakis, Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister, said ATMs are fully supplied with cash ahead of the weekend. The special commission, comprised of officials from the Bank of Greece and the Hellenic Bank Association, will meet on Sunday night to organise a restart of the banking system from Tuesday. As already reported, the ECB will meet on Monday to review the Greek situation and depending on the central bank\u2019s decision Greek authorities will decide which banking operations to restart. The European Central Bank will hold a detailed discussion on the results of the Greek referendum and whether to extend emergency liquidity assistance to the country\u2019s banks on Monday, said Austrian central banker Ewald Nowotny. He noted that the ECB had extended ELA loans this week but only until Monday when it will reassess its decision, Reuters reported. He added that the cash reserves of Greek banks, if they open again on Monday, \u201cwill very much depend on the outcome of the referendum\u201d. 100 researchers from the European University Institute have come out in support of the \u2018No\u2019 camp in Greece. The institute is an international postgraduate and post-doctoral teaching and research institute set up by European Union member states. The researchers say say a \u2018no\u2019 vote is a step towards a new Europe. We, researchers of the European University Institute, feel the urge and the duty to express our full-hearted solidarity with the Greek people, who, for five years now, have been suffering the dramatic consequences of the austerity policies imposed by the Troika, and how are now struggling for the right to decide upon their own future. We defend the right of the Greek people to freely express its will, and we support a \u2018NO\u2019 vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum in Greece... The choice, in Sunday\u2019s referendum, is neither about the euro nor about the Greek government. It is a choice between austerity and democracy in the whole of the European Union. A choice between fear and hope. Let\u2019s look at what economists have to say about Greece and the odds of an exit from the eurozone. Oxford Economics says: Whatever the referendum outcome, the ECB is unlikely to significantly increase ELA [emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks] limits any time soon. Cyprus was able to gradually loosen capital controls because of a decisive and credible commitment to reform. This is not possible in Greece. Our latest scenario analysis suggests an exit probability of around 67%. Economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale say: A \u2018Yes\u2019 vote: a semi-stable outcome at best. A \u2018Yes\u2019 vote would allow negotiations to resume on the basis of the late June proposals. However, early elections or an unstable coalition would also follow a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. And given the time and complexity entailed by a new programme, the third Greek bailout (worth between \u20ac60-80bn in our opinion) is unlikely to be approved before late August. As a result, Greece is set to default on its ECB debt repayments (both in July and August). Despite this however, the ECB will continue to provide liquidity to Greek banks as long as the line of communication remains open and at least until there is clarification on the political side. That being said, the ECB is likely to issue a statement requiring a programme to recapitalise Greek banks. The introduction of a parallel currency may be on the cards even with a \u2018Yes\u2019. Finally, even with a third bailout, the implementation risks remain high - creating a semi-stable outcome. A \u2018No\u2019 vote would significantly increase the odds of Grexit, though some hopes remain that it could be avoided. A \u2018No\u2019 vote would not immediately trigger a Grexit, especially as the chance of new elections still remain, even in this scenario (as the Greek president would most likely resign). Moreover, some form of negotiation may resume. As long as the line of communication remains open and until the Eurogroup and EU leaders make it clear that Grexit is unavoidable, the ECB will maintain ELA funding - though potentially with increased collateral haircuts. Once the political backing is given by the EU leaders, the ECB would start unwinding the ELA funding, trying to implement a managed exit in coordination with the Central Bank of Greece. The EU is much better equipped to stem contagion today than in 2011-12, with a QE programme in place, the ESM facilities (the Secondary Market Purchase Programme in particular) and the OMT. Moreover, the direct financial costs are manageable - though Cyprus, already under a programme, is the weakest link. The political contagion is the most significant (though not immediate) risk. Limiting this risk will require further steps towards a genuine monetary, fiscal and political union. The bank has also looked at the impact on financial markets. Clearly, markets are more in wait-and-see mode than in outright panic. Nevertheless, we expect the referendum to set the tone for next week, but whatever the result, we believe the markets are willing to move on to other issues, and we expect credit markets to normalise following the summer period. Both sides are equally to blame in letting the Greek debt crisis get to a point now fraught with immense political and economic risks for the entire eurozone, says Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser at the Centre for Economic and Business Research. She is also the author of Greekonomics: The Euro Crisis and Why Politicians Don\u2019t Get It. Asked by the Guardian how she would vote on Sunday, Pryce said: \u201cThe referendum should never have been held. But I would vote yes.\u201d She continued: In truth the creditors\u2019 offer to the Greeks differs little in terms of overall austerity to that asked for by the Greeks except on where some of the pain may fall and that hasn\u2019t been explained to the Greeks. There has been too much austerity but a no vote would make things worse. It would almost certainly mean banks becoming insolvent, an exit from the euro and a much faster decline in economic activity with hyperinflation following as the drachma that is introduced instantly devalues.\u201d A yes vote would keep banks open and give mandate for a deal to be struck that recognises the new Greek realities and includes, as the IMF now says, restructuring of the debt which every economist knows is unsustainable. This would offer some light at the end of the tunnel. A no vote would make that almost impossible to accomplish and could plunge Greece into years of economic turmoil.\u201d Here in the UK, Caroline Lucas, Green party MP for Brighton, has written in the Independent: The Troika\u2019s intransigence on austerity amounts to nothing short of an attempted coup. A democratically elected Government is being backed in a corner by the servants of capital who are desperate to embarrass the Greek electorate for daring to question austerity. For those of us who believe in the EU as a body which should uphold human rights and value solidarity, this bullying is particularly repulsive. More from the head of Greece\u2019s banking association: Greek banks have a \u201cliquidity cushion\u201d of \u20ac1bn but funds beyond Monday depend on the European Central Bank. Greek banks have been closed since Monday after bailout talks collapsed and a referendum was called. Louka Katseli told reporters, according to Reuters: Liquidity is assured until Monday, thereafter it will depend on the ECB decision. A reader in the Netherlands has sent us this. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup, spoke after the Dutch cabinet meeting today with regard to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 comments on a deal being in the offing. According to Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant, Dijsselbloem described this as \u201ccompletely incorrect\u201d and said: \u201cHe [Varoufakis] made that up completely. No new proposals have been sent to Athens,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are not near a solution.\u201d Many thanks for the translation to our reader in The Hague, Rik Remeijn. At least half a million Greeks are unable to vote in the referendum \u2013 unless they return to the country before Sunday\u2019s poll. Under Greek law, people must travel home to where they are registered for voting. Since the 2007-08 financial crisis, 405,666 Greeks have left the country, according to Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical office. The head of Greece\u2019s bank association has just said that Greek banks have enough liquidity to see them through Monday morning, according to Reuters. After that, everything depends on the ECB. In his TV address, Tsipras also reiterated that Sunday\u2019s referendum is not about Greece\u2019s membership of the euro. The latest opinion poll, from Greek newspaper Avgi, shows that Greeks remain divided. 43% would vote \u2018no\u2019, 42.5% \u2018yes\u2019, and 9% haven\u2019t decided yet. Meanwhile, tabloid Bild has polled readers in its own Greece referendum. \u201cShould we support Greece with further taxpayer billions?\u201d was the loaded question it asked readers. Referring to the Greek referendum on Sunday, Bild said: We Germans should be asked whether we want to go on paying! Europe has been paying for bankrupt Greece for the last five years. Athens has received about \u20ac325bn in total. Germany\u2019s share is about \u20ac88bn. Bild has asked Germans in Berlin how they would vote. Some would continue to support Greece to show solidarity, because \u2018the country cannot help itself\u2019. The majority, however, in the poll voted \u2018no!\u2019. Staying with the German press for now\u2026 the liberal weekly Die Zeit has made an emotional appeal to Greece: \u201cStay with us!\u201d In an editorial available in German, Greek and English, Marc Brost writes: Dear Greece, you\u2019re deciding about your country\u2019s future. But it goes far beyond that. None of us has to make such a decision and we can be happy about that, because if Greeks are now voting, it is not only their own future that will be decided. You, dear Greeks, also will be making a decision about the fate of 500 million people in Europe. You will decide how things will be for all of us. It is only fitting for this insidious and confusing crisis that everything now comes down to a seemingly simple yes or no by the Greek people, even though so many very painful decisions are involved. It is not yet clear whether there will even be a referendum at all. But, one way or another you, dear Greeks, must turn against the policies you voted for just five months ago. You must take the side of the creditor nations, even though you voted down their crisis policies in the parliamentary elections. You must come to terms with your creditors, even though many of you have the impression you have been betrayed in the past couple of years. That is a lot to ask. And yet, that is where our hope lies. No one can tell you how you should vote; not a minister from abroad and certainly not a foreign newspaper. But a lot of people in Europe now have grown very concerned. Here are more comments from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, courtesy of German news agency dpa (translated by The Local news site). The German finance minister said there will be no quick release of bailout funds to Greece after the referendum on whether to accept its creditors\u2019 terms on Sunday. Any new bailout would have to be negotiated \u201con a completely new basis and under toughened economic preconditions.\u201d He added that he would not be able to join other eurozone finance ministers in negotiations for a new bailout for Greece without the agreement of the Bundestag, the German parliament. Tsipras said the IMF\u2019s analysis showing Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable justifies his government\u2019s decision to reject an aid package that offered no debt relief. In a televised address to the nation ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum, the Greek prime minister urged Greeks to vote \u201coxi\u201d (no) on the bailout package. Yesterday an event of major political importance happened. The IMF published a report on Greece\u2019s economy, which is a great vindication for the Greek government as it conforms the obvious \u2013 that Greek debt is not sustainable.\u201d Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has addressed the nation on Greek television. He said the latest IMF report confirms his government\u2019s argument that its debt position is not sustainable. The report said the cash-strapped country needs up to \u20ac60bn (\u00a342bn) of extra funds over the next three years and large-scale debt relief to give Greece some breathing space and get its economy back on track. Tsipras also called on Greeks to \u201ccalmly go to the polls\u201d on Sunday. Greek business leading are voicing growing concerns over capital controls, adds Helena Smith who reports that speculation is mounting that they could be enforced for much longer than a few weeks. She writes: In four short days capital controls have had a catastrophic effect. This week alone business leaders estimate that the measures have wrought \u20ac1.2bn worth of damage on an economy that has essentially come to a grinding halt. \u201cImports, exports, factories, firms, transport, everything is frozen,\u201d said Vasillis Korkidis, who heads the national Confederation of Hellenic Commerce. \u201cThe only sectors in demand are food and fuel.\u201d \u201cEven in the best case scenario it is going to take months to recover from the shock of closed banks and capital controls,\u201d Korkidis told me. \u201cWe already estimate that the damage is around \u20ac1.2bn already which will almost certainly have to be added to any agreement [to balance budgets].\u201d Shortages have begun to appear with popular Cycladic island destinations further away from stock, being especially hit. Reports of shortages in medications and basics are said to be on the rise in Athens. Korkidis said committees had been established in all four of the country\u2019s systemic banks to examine applications from companies that need to pay suppliers for food and medication. \u201cBut they won\u2019t be doing that until after the referendum next week which means more shortages.\u201d Currently all bank transaction have been stopped because of controls. Meanwhile, tourism, the engine of the Greek economy, has also taken a huge hit with an estimated 50,000 holidaymakers cancelling bookings every day. The Greek Tourism Confederation (SETE) announced that bookings were down by 40% in the last few days following the government\u2019s decision to hold a referendum at what will shortly be the height of the tourist season. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 hopes of a quick deal do not seem to fit in with what the Germans think, it would seem. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been speaking to Bild: Three out of four members of business group the Institute of Directors think it is likely Greece will be forced to leave the eurozone within the next twelve months. In a new survey IoD members said the most probable outcome of Grexit would be \u201ca messy default which negatively affects financial markets and creates pressure on other euro members.\u201d This outcome was considered likely by nearly two-thirds of the business leaders surveyed, while 45% also thought there was a risk of widespread bank runs in other southern European countries. Longer-term, 45% of members said there is a good chance that Grexit would be followed by other countries leaving the euro. Nearly half thought a Greek exit from the eurozone would have a negative impact on the UK. The European Financial Stability Facility - Greece\u2019s biggest creditor - has decided not to request immediate repayment or its near \u20ac150bn of loans in the wake of the country\u2019s decision not to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the IMF this week. Nor did it waive its right to action, it said. Instead it opted for a Reservation of Rights on its loans to Greece. This basically means it keeps all its options open as a creditor as events unfold. But it did say the non-payment to the IMF was \u201can event of default.\u201d It said it would monitor the situation continuously. Chief executive Klaus Regling said: \u201cThe EFSF is Greece\u2019s biggest creditor. This event of default is cause for deep concern. It breaks the commitment made by Greece to honour its financial obligations to all its creditors, and it opens the door to severe consequences for the Greek economy and the Greek people. The EFSF will closely coordinate with the euro area Member States, the European Commission, and the IMF on its future actions.\u201d The EFSF loans concerned are \u20ac109.1 billion under the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement, \u20ac5.5 billion under the Bond Interest Facility Agreement and \u20ac30 billion under Private Sector Involvement Facility Agreement. Keeping Greece in the eurozone while easing its debt burden is correct and achieveable, according to Jeffrey D. Sachs, UN special advisor and author of The End of Poverty. In a new blogpost he sets out four stages to achieve this: First, I recommend that the Greek people give a resounding \u201cNo\u201d to the creditors in the referendum on their demands this weekend. Second, Greece should continue to withhold service on its external debts to official creditors in advance of a consensual debt restructuring later this year. Given its great depression, Greece should use its savings to pay pensioners, provide food relief, make crucial infrastructure repairs, and direct liquidity toward the banking system. Third, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must use his persuasive powers to convince the public, in the style of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself. Specifically, the government should make clear to all Greeks that their euro deposits are safe; that the country will remain within the eurozone (despite the false claims by some members of the Eurogroup that a no vote means a Greek exit); and that its banks will reopen immediately after the referendum. Finally, Greece and Germany need to come to a rapprochement soon after the referendum and agree to a package of economic reforms and debt relief. No country \u2013 including Greece \u2013 should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth, to the benefit of both debtor and creditor. And yet, a corpse cannot carry out reforms. That is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together, not reforms \u201cfirst\u201d with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future (as some in Europe have said to Greece). Easing Greece\u2019s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis, and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between Germany and Greece, to which the rest of Europe will subscribe. The result would be a win not only for those countries, but also for the world economy. And the piece seems to have some immediate support: As if the chaos triggered by Sunday\u2019s referendum was not enough, Greece\u2019s defence minister Panos Kammenos has also caused waves with highly controversial remarks that the army can always \u201cguarantee the country\u2019s internal stability.\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Much ado this morning in Greece over the defence minister\u2019s oddly-timed assertion that the country\u2019s armed forces have the role of not only securing external borders but internal security too. Kammenos, who also heads the nationalist, right wing Independent Greeks party, the government\u2019s junior partner, felt fit to announce on Thursday (in the presence of prime minister Alexis Tsipras) that: \u201cThe country\u2019s armed forces guarantee stability internally, the defense of national sovereignty and the country\u2019s territorial integrity [and] stability in relation with the country\u2019s alliances.\u201d In a nation where memories of military rule have not been forgotten (barely 40 years have elapsed since the collapse of military dictatorship), many are now asking what was he trying to say? Was he perhaps alluding to a coup d\u2019etat? \u201cThis language is dangerous for democracy. It is an open threat against the rights and freedoms of the Greek people and of every citizen individually,\u201d said Fofi Genimmatas who heads the socialist Pasok party. Speaking on Skai TV earlier, Athens\u2019 mayor George Kaminis also expressed consternation. \u201cWhat does this gentleman want to say \u2013 that he is preparing a coup d\u2019etat?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd if he saying that the forces of defence are ready to intervene in the event of internal unrest \u2013 what does that mean?\u201d Only in \u201cSoviet-type regimes\u201d did the army ensure internal stability, said the main opposition shadow defense minister Kostas Tasoulas, adding that it was the role of the police to guarantee stability. There was speculation today that with his remarks (remarks Tsipras appears to have given tacit support to) Kammenos was trying to show that the government was in full control of the army. Campaign group Global Justice is at the British Museum to show solidarity with Greece: The Global Justice release says: Members of the campaign groups Global Justice Now and Jubilee Debt Campaign have this morning unfurled a banner at the \u2018Elgin Marbles\u2019 in the British Museum with the slogan \u201cOXI No - No More Looting - Support Greece\u201d Many see the statues as a symbol of how northern Europe \u2018looted\u2019 Greek wealth in the past, and protestors claim that the enormous international pressure being placed on Greece to institute austerity, privatisation and deregulation represents a similar looting today. And now it seems Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is about to make another TV statement. EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has said Greece\u2019s position will be weakened if the country votes no. My colleague Jennifer Rankin tweets: Juncker was speaking at a press conference to mark the beginning of the Luxembourg presidency. Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel said the Greek referendum was about whether Greece stayed in the eurozone or not. He said he wanted to run his presidency based on trust, adding (pointedly?): I spent several days with Alexis Tsipras in Brussels and he never talked of a referendum, then he went home and called [one]. European Central Bank member Ewald Nowotny has said the emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks will last until Monday: Questions about the Greek crisis? Put them to two of our writers who have been following the situation closely, feature writer Jon Henley and financial editor Nils Pratley, at 1pm BST today. Follow the link to post your questions for the live Q&amp;A: Here\u2019s more on the comments from Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, courtesy of the Kathimerini newspaper: The Syriza-led government decided that a referendum was the only way forward as the proposal submitted by Greece\u2019s international creditors before talks collapsed on Friday \u201cwould never have been ratified by Parliament and would have brought down the government,\u201d Alternate Minister of International Economic Relations and chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos told Skai television on Friday morning. Tsakalotos said that the Greek economy needs a \u201cshock of optimism\u201d with the removal, once and for all, of fears that Greece could be ousted from the eurozone. Syriza\u2019s Tsakalotos says referendum was called to stave off government collapse And a point that a no vote is a no against austerity, not against Europe: Some contributions received from our Guardian Witness call-out. Things seem calm in Corfu: And an invitation to tonight\u2019s Yes rally: Meanwhile a decision is due on whether the referendum can actually go ahead. Helena Smith reports: Greece\u2019s highest court, the Council of State has begun meeting in urgent session to consider the legality of Sunday\u2019s referendum.. At the request of the tribunal\u2019s vice president, Nicholas Sakellariou, the Council of State has begun meeting to consider whether the referendum should be cancelled on constitutional grounds. The court, the highest legal body in the land, was convened after two individuals contested the plebiscite. Even if the court rules against the referendum\u2019s legality there is some suggestion that with parliament having endorsed the plebiscite, it will still take place. Here\u2019s a piece from Jon Henley on the costly referendum Greece can scarcely afford: Its banks closed and being drained steadily of cash, its economic and political crises worsening by the day, Greece is scrambling to organise a referendum on Sunday that it can ill afford. The leftist Syriza-led government of Alexis Tsipras says the cost of distributing ballot papers and paying monitors will be around \u20ac20m (\u00a314m), but the conservative opposition \u2013 citing finance ministry data \u2013 puts the final cost at closer to \u20ac120m. The vote will also be expensive for Greece\u2019s 10.5 million voters, many already hard pressed and all restricted since Monday to daily cash withdrawals of just \u20ac60. There is no postal or absentee voting: all who want to cast a ballot must return to the polling stations where they are registered, generally their home town. The latest polls show the result on a knife edge. A survey published on Friday morning by the ALCO institute put the yes camp on 44.8%, against 43.4% for no, with 74% of respondents saying they wanted Greece to remain in the euro. The referendum, the country\u2019s first since 1974, will use the same monitors and the same 19,000 polling stations as in the January general election that propelled Syriza and Tsipras to power. In a bid to encourage a high turnout, the government has said all public transport in the greater Athens area will be free. For voters returning from abroad, Aegean Airways is also organising four extra return \u201creferendum flights\u201d from London and Brussels on Sunday and Monday. Full story here: A temporary Grexit might be one way to help resolve the current crisis, allowing Greece to devalue the currency and become more competitive. That was the suggestion of Hans Werner Sinn of German economic research institute Ifo on BBC world service this morning. Talk about playing something down. Germany\u2019s economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has said the Greek crisis is \u201ca relatively small problem in Europe.\u201d To be fair, he was speaking in the context of the Ukraine conflict.... (Quote via Reuters) Over in Athens the spectre of bank cash reserves running dry is the cause of mounting concern in official and financial circles. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Is Greece heading towards a banking crisis? That is the question on the lips of government officials and senior financiers barely four days after banks were closed and capital controls imposed. In another interview this morning with an Athenian radio station, the Greek finance minister appeared to acknowledge those concerns saying: \u201cUntil Monday there will not be a problem at ATM\u2019s.\u201d (NB: Earlier on RTE radio in Ireland he said banks would re-open on Tuesday) Asked if the leftist-led government would be able to pay salaries and pensions at the end of the month he retorted: \u201cThis week is problematic but it is an investment in a viable agreement. The state will be able to pay [wages and pensions] because on Monday we will have an agreement, one way or another. What is important is that revenues haven\u2019t collapse. The problem is paper money.\u201d That chimes with what business leaders have been saying for some days now: that by Monday lenders will have run out of cash supplies to ensure that ATMs are replenished. Claims that a deal will be reached with creditors by Monday \u201cone way or another\u201d have been met with disbelief with the Syriza-led administration looking ever more chaotic in its handling of the situation. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 pledge last night that he would personally fly off to Brussels so that an accord is signed \u201cwithin 48 hours\u201d of the referendum \u2013 \u201cwhether the result is a \u2018yes\u2019 which would be for a solution that is unviable or a no that will strengthen our hand\u201d \u2013 has added to the sense of growing confusion. Eurozone retail sales for May have come in slightly better than expected, up 0.2% month on month compared to estimates of a 0.1% rise. The year on year rise was 2.4% compared to a 2.3% forecast. Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments: Greece\u2019s highest administrative court will rule on whether the country\u2019s bailout referendum violates the constitution, amid growing concern that the hastily organised vote falls short of democratic standards. With less than 48 hours until polling day on Sunday, the yes and no sides will stage large rallies in Athens on Friday evening. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is expected to turn out at the no rally, having attacked his eurozone partners for trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d his country into accepting a bad deal. Greeks are being asked whether to support an EU bailout deal that would grant the debt-stricken country money in exchange for spending cuts and further reform. However, the bailout plan no longer exists, having lapsed on 30 June. Eurozone leaders have lined up to say that voting no means saying goodbye to Greece\u2019s eurozone membership, but Greece\u2019s radical left Syriza-led government insists a no vote would simply boost its negotiating hand. Later on Friday, the Council of State will determine whether the vote violates Greece\u2019s constitution, which bans referendums on fiscal policy. Full story here: Following the earlier report that Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the government chose a referendum because an agreement would not be passed by parliament, the man himself has tweeted to clarify: Which seems to translate to: Enough with the distortion. What I said on SKAI is that the proposal of institutions will not be passed by the House, not ours. And here\u2019s the UK services PMI, which showed the sector growing by more than expected: Here\u2019s a roundup of the day\u2019s PMI data so far, and it\u2019s all relatively positive. The eurozone composite PMI: Eurozone services PMI: Ireland\u2019s service sector: Italy: France: Spain: Germany: And from earlier, China: Here\u2019s an idea of the timings for Sunday\u2019s referendum: That\u2019s if the Council of State doesn\u2019t rule against it of course. A decision is expected by this evening. Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has reportedly said that the government chose a referendum because an agreement would not be passed by parliament: Story here (in Greek). More on tonight\u2019s rallies: Speaking of polls (but not the Greek referendum this time): Meanwhile UBS has looked at the chances of Greece leaving the eurozone, depending on the result of the referendum: Varoufakis said that even if the yes side won, it would be \u201ca narrow victory\u201d and Syriza would still be the only party capable of running the country. He admitted the Greek government had made mistakes: \u201cIt would be arrogant to day we hadn\u2019t - we\u2019re not professionals at this.\u201d Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said that whatever the outcome of the referendum a deal is almost done, and there have been private discussions with the ECB and EU during the week. Speaking on RTE radio in Ireland he said a deal was \u201cin the offing,\u201d If the vote was yes, the Greek government would sign on the dotted line. If no, they had had some decent proposals from Europe in confidence. Greeks are being asked a question in the referendum which is not factually or legally correct, according to European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has said. In an interview with Die Welt, he said: The referendum question is neither factually nor legally correct. The proposals of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, which are to be voted on are based on a now expired credit program. The Euro Group has not accepted or declined. They do not correspond to the final state of negotiations - as Tsipras announced the referendum, we were still in the middle of the talks. The Greeks, however, on Sunday will also send a political signal to the rest of Europe. A yes will mean that they want to work closely with the other euro-zone countries to find a solution. A No would make the differences even more evident, and a solution more complicated. He added: It would be wrong to assume that a No would strengthen the Greek negotiating position. The opposite is the case. Following the closure of banks and the introduction of capital controls to attain financial stability again, it has become more complicated and more expensive. Greece is in a substantially worse situation than it was last week. The full interview is here in German. Markets have opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 down just 4 points, Germany off 0.3% and Italy, Spain and France flat. On the economic front, there are service sector PMI figures due from Italy, France, Germany and the eurozone as a whole, as well as the UK. The US, of course, is closed for the Independence Day holiday. Greece\u2019s finance minister clearly relishes the IMF saying the country needs an agreement on debt relief: As the referendum clock ticks down towards Sunday\u2019s vote, there is still an outside chance it will not even go ahead. The Council of State, Greece\u2019s top administrative court, is due to rule on whether it breaches the country\u2019s constitution. Human rights group the Council of Europe has alaready expressed unhappiness with the vote, partly due to the speed of the process and also the question being asked. Meanwhile the latest poll shows a slight lead for the Yes side - those in favour of accepting the creditors\u2019 proposals. The ALCO polling institute poll, published in the Ethnos newspaper, showed 44.8% for Yes, 43.4% for No and 11.8% undecided. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has already said he would resign if the Yes vote won the day. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras remained defiant as he used another TV appearance to repeat his call for a No vote. He hit out at former prime ministers who had lined up to support the Yes side, and also suggested the IMF, which on Thursday said Greece would need an extra \u20ac60bn of funding and that debt relief had to be part of any new bailout, could have spoken up earlier. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Post-referendum looks pretty bleak for Greece either way but a \u2018No\u2019 vote carries a lot more short term risk. Evidence from the past five months is surely enough to show that muddling out-of-touch bureaucrats in Athens and the Eurozone will not reach a deal before there\u2019s a banking crisis. Without the European Central Bank\u2019s emergency funding, estimates are that Greece\u2019s banks are days from insolvency, even with only 60 euros being withdrawn a day under capital controls. Later come major rallies for both sides in Athens, as supporters gather in the last hours before the vote.",

It also said Greece will need at least \u20ac50bn in additional aid over the next three years to keep itself afloat.</p> <p>Publication of the draft Debt Sustainability Analysis laid bare a dispute between Brussels and the Washington-based global lender that has been simmering behind closed doors for months.</p> <p>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cited the report in a televised appeal to voters on Friday to say \u2018No\u2019 to the proposed austerity terms, which have anyway expired since talks broke down and Athens defaulted on an IMF loan this week.</p> <p>It was not clear whether an arcane IMF document would influence a cliffhanger poll in which Greece\u2019s future in the euro zone is at stake with banks closed, cash withdrawals rationed and commerce seizing up.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday an event of major political importance happened,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cThe IMF published a report on Greece\u2019s economy which is a great vindication for the Greek government as it confirms the obvious - that Greek debt is not sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>At a meeting on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s board on Wednesday, European members questioned the timing of the report which IMF management proposed at short notice releasing three days before Sunday\u2019s crucial referendum that may determine the country\u2019s future in the euro zone, the sources said.</p> <p>There was no vote but the Europeans were heavily outnumbered and the United States, the strongest voice in the IMF, was in favor of publication, the sources said.</p> <p>The Europeans were also concerned that the report could distract attention from a view they share with the IMF that the Tsipras government, in the five months since it was elected, has wrecked a fragile economy that was just starting to recover.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision,\u201d an IMF source involved in the debate over publication said. \u201cWe are not living in an ivory tower here. But the EU has to understand that not everything can be decided based on their own imperatives.\u201d</p> <p>The board had considered all arguments, including the risk that the document would be politicized, but the prevailing view was that all the evidence and figures should be laid out transparently before the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cFacts are stubborn.

The anti-austerity movement that took Europe by storm, when it was swept into power on the back of popular discontent in January, now faces an existential battle. \u201cIn Europe they want to squelch us because they only want one policy, the doctrine of neo-liberalism, to succeed,\u201d the administrative reform minister Giorgos Katrougalos said earlier today.</p> <p>There is growing acceptance that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 high-stakes gamble calling the referendum may well backfire. The \u201cyes\u201d vote has swelled in recent days as big name political and cultural figures have come out in support. If the outcome on Sunday is a massive turnout in support for the \u201cyes\u201d vote, it will augur political developments with Tsipras and his radical left Syriza party possibly even having to step down on Monday.

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports</p> <blockquote> <p>There is almost no ATM in central Athens, as I write, that does not have a huddle of people, cards to the ready, in front of it. This is the beginning of what was meant to be another record year of tourist arrivals and many of those now lining up around cash dispensers are holidaymakers (or journalists as the very heart of the Greek capital has also been taken over by a media circus). </p> <p>And therein lies the problem: by Monday ATMs will have run out of the very cash Greece so badly needs precisely because demands far outstrips supply and stocks are running out fast. \u201cI have very grave doubts as to whether banks will open on Tuesday and even if they do there will be no cash transactions,\u201d one banker confided. \u201cI have seen directors at the Bank of Greece in a state of panic because our liquidity buffer is being eaten up and without the [bailout] programme there\u2019s no ELA [emergency liquidity assistance]. We are in a real mess.\u201d</p> <p>With capital controls in place, many fear it could be months before they are fully lifted, with potentially devastating repercussions for the economy. </p> <p>\u201cThe situation is very serious,\u201d the president of the national confederation of Hellenic Commerce Vasillis Korkidis told me earlier. \u201cNow that they are in place capital controls may last for a year. The cap on cash withdrawals will probably be raised (from \u20ac60 per day) but other restrictions vould remain in place. We saw what happened to Cyprus where it took two years before controls were lifted.\u201d</p> <p>As we reported earlier today the Greek finance minister himself said \u201cpaper money\u201d had become a problem. </p> <p>If banks run out of cash before Sunday\u2019s referendum it could have a devastating effect on the \u201cno\u201d vote, analysts say. </p> <p>\u201cThe site of ATMs running out of cash before Sunday would destroy the no vote,\u201d said the prominent political commentatos Aristides Hatzis. \u201cThe \u201cyes\u201d would win with a landslide which is why the government is insisting and I think praying that everything will be OK at least until Monday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5596b729e4b00bdd27707a37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T16:27:43.683Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s top administrative court has rejected an appeal by two Greek citizens against Sunday\u2019s referendum on the country\u2019s bailout package, as just reported.

Cyprus was able to gradually loosen capital controls because of a decisive and credible commitment to reform. This is not possible in Greece. Our latest scenario analysis suggests an exit probability of around 67%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>A \u2018Yes\u2019 vote: a semi-stable outcome at best.</strong></p> <p>A \u2018Yes\u2019 vote would allow negotiations to resume on the basis of the late June proposals. However, early elections or an unstable coalition would also follow a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. And given the time and complexity entailed by a new programme, the third Greek bailout (worth between \u20ac60-80bn in our opinion) is unlikely to be approved before late August. As a result, Greece is set to default on its ECB debt repayments (both in July and August). Despite this however, the ECB will continue to provide liquidity to Greek banks as long as the line of communication remains open and at least until there is clarification on the political side. That being said, the ECB is likely to issue a statement requiring a programme to recapitalise Greek banks. The introduction of a parallel currency may be on the cards even with a \u2018Yes\u2019. Finally, even with a third bailout, the implementation risks remain high - creating a semi-stable outcome.</p> <p> <strong>A \u2018No\u2019 vote would significantly increase the odds of Grexit, though some hopes remain that it could be avoided.</strong></p> <p>A \u2018No\u2019 vote would not immediately trigger a Grexit, especially as the chance of new elections still remain, even in this scenario (as the Greek president would most likely resign). Moreover, some form of negotiation may resume. As long as the line of communication remains open and until the Eurogroup and EU leaders make it clear that Grexit is unavoidable, the ECB will maintain ELA funding - though potentially with increased collateral haircuts. Once the political backing is given by the EU leaders, the ECB would start unwinding the ELA funding, trying to implement a managed exit in coordination with the Central Bank of Greece. The EU is much better equipped to stem contagion today than in 2011-12, with a QE programme in place, the ESM facilities (the Secondary Market Purchase Programme in particular) and the OMT. Moreover, the direct financial costs are manageable - though Cyprus, already under a programme, is the weakest link. The political contagion is the most significant (though not immediate) risk. Limiting this risk will require further steps towards a genuine monetary, fiscal and political union.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bank has also looked at the impact on financial markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clearly, markets are more in wait-and-see mode than in outright panic. Nevertheless, we expect the referendum to set the tone for next week, but whatever the result, we believe the markets are willing to move on to other issues, and we expect credit markets to normalise following the summer period.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5596a09ae4b00bdd277079c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T14:50:51.947Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/27/greek-bailout-extension-refused-panel-leading-economists-give-their-verdict\">Both sides are equally to blame</a> in letting the Greek debt crisis get to a point now fraught with immense political and economic risks for the entire eurozone, says Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser at the Centre for Economic and Business Research.

There has been too much austerity but a no vote would make things worse. It would almost certainly mean banks becoming insolvent, an exit from the euro and a much faster decline in economic activity with hyperinflation following as the drachma that is introduced instantly devalues.\u201d</p> <p>A yes vote would keep banks open and give mandate for a deal to be struck that recognises the new Greek realities and includes, as the IMF now says, restructuring of the debt which every economist knows is unsustainable.

This week alone business leaders estimate that the measures have wrought \u20ac1.2bn worth of damage on an economy that has essentially come to a grinding halt. </p> <p>\u201cImports, exports, factories, firms, transport, everything is frozen,\u201d said Vasillis Korkidis, who heads the national Confederation of Hellenic Commerce. \u201cThe only sectors in demand are food and fuel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven in the best case scenario it is going to take months to recover from the shock of closed banks and capital controls,\u201d Korkidis told me. \u201cWe already estimate that the damage is around \u20ac1.2bn already which will almost certainly have to be added to any agreement [to balance budgets].\u201d</p> <p>Shortages have begun to appear with popular Cycladic island destinations further away from stock, being especially hit. Reports of shortages in medications and basics are said to be on the rise in Athens. </p> <p>Korkidis said committees had been established in all four of the country\u2019s systemic banks to examine applications from companies that need to pay suppliers for food and medication. \u201cBut they won\u2019t be doing that until after the referendum next week which means more shortages.\u201d </p> <p>Currently all bank transaction have been stopped because of controls. </p> <p>Meanwhile, tourism, the engine of the Greek economy, has also taken a huge hit with an estimated 50,000 holidaymakers cancelling bookings every day. The Greek Tourism Confederation (SETE) announced that bookings were down by 40% in the last few days following the government\u2019s decision to hold a referendum at what will shortly be the height of the tourist season. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e5f01fa2a11ac837f2bedb636e74c79c6842d1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5f01fa2a11ac837f2bedb636e74c79c6842d1b/0_275_4163_2499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourism hit by Greek uncertainty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourism hit by Greek uncertainty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Socrates Baltagiannis/dpa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5596866be4b0f06669f07766\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T12:58:21.955Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 hopes of a quick deal do not seem to fit in with what the Germans think, it would seem.</p> <p>German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been speaking to Bild:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/616948861035257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">German FinMin Sch\u00e4uble in Bild: Any new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> aid deal would take some time, needs &#39;new basis&#39;</p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/616948861035257856\">July 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge/statuses/616949566559154176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SCHAEUBLE TELLS BILD GREECE MUST DELIVER REFORMS TO GET AID</p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/616949566559154176\">July 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55967d03e4b016ebe1d64d8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T12:18:33.461Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Three out of four members of business group the Institute of Directors think it is likely Greece will be forced to leave the eurozone within the next twelve months.</strong></p> <p>In a new survey IoD members said the most probable outcome of Grexit would be \u201ca messy default which negatively affects financial markets and creates pressure on other euro members.\u201d This outcome was considered likely by nearly two-thirds of the business leaders surveyed, while 45% also thought there was a risk of widespread bank runs in other southern European countries.</p> <p>Longer-term, 45% of members said there is a good chance that Grexit would be followed by other countries leaving the euro.</p> <p>Nearly half thought a Greek exit from the eurozone would have a negative impact on the UK.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55967adee4b0b5f41acb23bc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T12:14:42.884Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">EFSF won't ask for immediate repayment of Greek loans</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Financial Stability Facility - Greece\u2019s biggest creditor - has decided not to request immediate repayment or its near \u20ac150bn of loans in the wake of the country\u2019s decision not to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the IMF this week.</p> <p>Nor did it waive its right to action, it said.

Sachs, UN special advisor and author of The End of Poverty.</strong></p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-debt-crisis-eurozone-by-jeffrey-d-sachs-2015-07\"><strong>new blogpost</strong></a> he sets out four stages to achieve this:</p> <blockquote> <p>First, I recommend that the Greek people give a resounding \u201cNo\u201d to the creditors in the referendum on their demands this weekend.</p> <p>Second, Greece should continue to withhold service on its external debts to official creditors in advance of a consensual debt restructuring later this year. Given its great depression, Greece should use its savings to pay pensioners, provide food relief, make crucial infrastructure repairs, and direct liquidity toward the banking system. </p> <p>Third, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must use his persuasive powers to convince the public, in the style of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself. Specifically, the government should make clear to all Greeks that their euro deposits are safe; that the country will remain within the eurozone (despite the false claims by some members of the Eurogroup that a no vote means a Greek exit); and that its banks will reopen immediately after the referendum. </p> <p>Finally, Greece and Germany need to come to a rapprochement soon after the referendum and agree to a package of economic reforms and debt relief. No country \u2013 including Greece \u2013 should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth, to the benefit of both debtor and creditor. And yet, a corpse cannot carry out reforms. That is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together, not reforms \u201cfirst\u201d with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future (as some in Europe have said to Greece). </p> <p>Easing Greece\u2019s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis, and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between Germany and Greece, to which the rest of Europe will subscribe. The result would be a win not only for those countries, but also for the world economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the piece seems to have some immediate support:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/statuses/616938540677603328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A Way Out for Greece, by Jeff Sachs <a href=\"http://t.co/TZtsT8bSjH\">http://t.co/TZtsT8bSjH</a></p>&mdash; Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/616938540677603328\">July 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559670b8e4b016ebe1d64d4f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T11:31:14.289Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek defence minister's comments cause waves</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As if the chaos triggered by Sunday\u2019s referendum was not enough, Greece\u2019s defence minister Panos Kammenos has also caused waves with highly controversial remarks that the army can always \u201cguarantee the country\u2019s internal stability.\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Much ado this morning in Greece over the defence minister\u2019s oddly-timed assertion that the country\u2019s armed forces have the role of not only securing external borders but internal security too.</p> <p>Kammenos, who also heads the nationalist, right wing Independent Greeks party, the government\u2019s junior partner, felt fit to announce on Thursday (in the presence of prime minister Alexis Tsipras) that: </p> <p>\u201cThe country\u2019s armed forces guarantee stability internally, the defense of national sovereignty and the country\u2019s territorial integrity [and] stability in relation with the country\u2019s alliances.\u201d</p> <p>In a nation where memories of military rule have not been forgotten (barely 40 years have elapsed since the collapse of military dictatorship), many are now asking what was he trying to say?

The Euro Group has not accepted or declined. They do not correspond to the final state of negotiations - as Tsipras announced the referendum, we were still in the middle of the talks. The Greeks, however, on Sunday will also send a political signal to the rest of Europe. A yes will mean that they want to work closely with the other euro-zone countries to find a solution. A No would make the differences even more evident, and a solution more complicated.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote> <p>It would be wrong to assume that a No would strengthen the Greek negotiating position. The opposite is the case. Following the closure of banks and the introduction of capital controls to attain financial stability again, it has become more complicated and more expensive. Greece is in a substantially worse situation than it was last week.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c1c95cb4d300f79d04cc4c56a87f127db134e1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1c95cb4d300f79d04cc4c56a87f127db134e1a/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dombrovskis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dombrovskis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Vidal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The full interview is <a href=\"http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article143477355/Referendum-faktisch-und-juristisch-nicht-korrekt.html\"><strong>here</strong></a> in German.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T07:16:34.723Z\">at 8.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5596333fe4b03edf9cb7c28e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T07:03:40.057Z\">8.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets have opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 down just 4 points, Germany off 0.3% and Italy, Spain and France flat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5596326fe4b03edf9cb7c28b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T07:00:41.742Z\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On the economic front, there are service sector PMI figures due from Italy, France, Germany and the eurozone as a whole, as well as the UK.</strong></p> <p>The US, of course, is closed for the Independence Day holiday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T07:01:02.687Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55963136e4b03edf9cb7c289\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T06:56:39.495Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s finance minister clearly relishes the IMF saying the country needs an agreement on debt relief:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/statuses/616833088585363456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IMF Agrees With Athens That Greece Needs Debt Relief - The New York Times <a href=\"http://t.co/5c6vp0Y407\">http://t.co/5c6vp0Y407</a></p>&mdash; Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/616833088585363456\">July 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559628b6e4b03edf9cb7c280\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-03T06:54:38.056Z\">7.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Introduction: Greece awaits referendum developments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.referendum2015gov.gr/en/\"><strong>referendum clock</strong></a> ticks down towards Sunday\u2019s vote, there is still an outside chance it will not even go ahead.</p> <p>The Council of State, Greece\u2019s top administrative court, is due to rule on whether it breaches the country\u2019s constitution.

    "webTitle": "'What matters is that it works': Peter Hendy on TfL, Network Rail and mayors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It only took five days. On Saturday 20 June, Sir Peter Hendy was approached to be the new chair of Network Rail. By 5pm on Wednesday he had accepted, and less than 24 hours later ministers were publicly admitting the depth of the crisis in the railways, scrapping pledges of major upgrades and announcing the new faces being parachuted in to run the system. The speed of Hendy\u2019s move, after almost a decade as London\u2019s transport commissioner, underlines the government\u2019s desperation to get to grips with Network Rail \u2013 and left him as surprised as anyone. \u201cNo one guessed \u2013 in fact, not even I guessed it was going to happen. Hendy, unexpectedly, was leaving the London role he had made his own. Now, he claims: \u201cI\u2019m adjusted to it, because the truth is the day you say you\u2019re going, everything starts happening around you. You might as well go \u2013 there\u2019s no point in hanging around for a farewell party.\u201d Hendy will be walking out of Transport for London\u2019s (TfL) Windsor House office for the final time next week and is already juggling the two roles, his mobile phone\u2019s \u201cMind the Gap\u201d ringtone sounding repeatedly. He will earn \u00a3500,000 at Network Rail, where his first job is to review what parts of the \u00a338.5bn five-year plan can actually be delivered. The electrification of two major lines through the Midlands and across the Pennines has been shelved. More projects are likely to follow. The job may have interrupted his eventual plans for a more convivial Brussels post, but he says: \u201cDoing a four-day week, and someone else in charge on a daily basis, is quite nice at the age of 62. That\u2019s not a bad outcome.\u201d Yet Hendy will be doing double the workload of his predecessor, Richard Parry-Jones, and is a noted hands-on operator \u2013 raising questions about how his role will sit alongside chief executive Mark Carne. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do with his day off; at TfL he texts the mayor every single morning with an update, never off monitoring the system, even at weekends. Management may be, he says, about strategic visions, \u201cbut if I go round talking about London in 2030, no one gives a shit if you can\u2019t run the Northern Line to people\u2019s general satisfaction. If you can\u2019t demonstrate that the organisation can function on a daily basis, nothing else you talk about matters \u2013 so as a chief executive, watching how it performs is quite important\u201d. Network Rail\u2019s fundamental issues are similar to London\u2019s, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s high intensity, we no longer have an off-peak. When I started 40 years ago, if your bus service was up the creek at half past nine you\u2019d spend the rest of the morning putting it right so it would be OK in the evening \u2013 you don\u2019t get that luxury now. And people expect public services to be well provided and the people who run them to be pleasant and helpful. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve proved at TfL is that it is difficult, but you can do it.\u201d TfL has taken in some national rail services as part of London Overground, although Hendy warns that the latest extension east may take a while to improve. \u201cIt has been more difficult than we thought because the trains are in such a bad condition \u2013 the doors, the kit,\u201d he says. New trains have been ordered. But the leeway to run better services might be tested in years ahead. Hendy says a significant cut to the city\u2019s funding in the spending review is \u201cnot even likely, but certain\u201d, and his successors will have to work hard and ingeniously to manage the budget. He warns that promises of fare freezes from some London mayoral candidates for 2016 are unrealistic. \u201cKen [Livingstone] used to say,\u201d he adopts a nasal voice, \u201c\u2018you always want to put up the fares\u2019. I always do, because I want the money to spend on what we do.\u201d By 2019, Hendy says, London will be operating public transport without any kind of subsidy. \u201cThe bus service is a challenge: there is going to have to be some ingenuity to pay for that, because what you mustn\u2019t do is leave people behind. \u201cThat\u2019s how some of my predecessors managed: Camberwell New Road, you couldn\u2019t get on the bus for three quarters of an hour in the morning, because we couldn\u2019t afford to run buses. Not being able to afford sufficient peak services for people to get to work and kids to get to school is not good for the economic health of the city.\u201d TfL has taken some controversial measures, including ticket office closures, to balance the books. Hendy says this was not just costcutting: \u201cNow you don\u2019t even need an Oyster card,\u201d he says, pointing to his phone. \u201cYou can\u2019t envisage this place stuck in aspic when you\u2019ve got massive grant cuts.\u201d Boris Johnson trusted Hendy enough to keep him in the job when he was elected mayor, when many Tories were urging him to sack someone they saw as Livingstone\u2019s man; now Conservatives have entrusted him with digging Network Rail out of a crisis. Hendy says he is \u201cagnostic\u201d over rumoured quasi-privatisation plans. \u201cWhat matters to me is that it works well,\u201d he insists. The difference between Livingstone and Johnson, he says, was \u201cless than anyone supposes really. They\u2019ve got different philosophies, but the job of the mayor is surprisingly similar. They both grasped the essential nature of making the city work.\u201d On buses, he says, Johnson has been \u201cjust as good\u201d, and even his spectacularly underused cable car escapes overt criticism. Hendy says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the biggest mandate of any politician in Britain, so if you say I\u2019m going to build a cable car, if the commissioner of transport thinks that\u2019s entirely the wrong idea and [you] shouldn\u2019t do it, he should piss off and let someone else do what the mayor wants.\u201d TfL spent millions drawing up plans for a Thames Estuary airport that was icily dismissed by the Airports Commission chair, Sir Howard Davies, as having no support, bar the mayor\u2019s. Hendy refuses to comment: \u201cNo, you can ask Boris about that.\u201d But any airport expansion would need billions more spent on roads and rail than the commission acknowledges, he says \u2013 \u00a310bn-plus for Heathrow, or \u00a36bn for Gatwick. Generally, Hendy believes money has been well spent. Tube upgrades, such as the Victoria line, \u201cleave no one in any doubt we can spend the money correctly\u201d. Few say the same for Network Rail right now, which is why Hendy \u2013 even in the strange circumstances of his appointment \u2013 fits the bill. He certainly does not seem a man eager to leave. Asked what he will miss, he looks choked. \u201cI\u2019ll miss everything,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss this place terribly. It\u2019s been my life for 15 years. I\u2019m going to miss it a lot.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It only took five days. On Saturday 20 June, Sir Peter Hendy was approached to be the new chair of Network Rail. By 5pm on Wednesday he had accepted, and less than 24 hours later ministers were publicly admitting the depth of the crisis in the railways, scrapping pledges of major upgrades and announcing the new faces being parachuted in to run the system.</p> <p>The speed of Hendy\u2019s move, after almost a decade as London\u2019s transport commissioner, underlines the government\u2019s desperation to get to grips with Network Rail \u2013 and left him as surprised as anyone. \u201cNo one guessed \u2013 in fact, not even I guessed it was going to happen.</p> <p>Hendy, unexpectedly, was leaving the London role he had made his own. Now, he claims: \u201cI\u2019m adjusted to it, because the truth is the day you say you\u2019re going, everything starts happening around you. You might as well go \u2013 there\u2019s no point in hanging around for a farewell party.\u201d</p> <p>Hendy will be walking out of Transport for London\u2019s (TfL) Windsor House office for the final time next week and is already juggling the two roles, his mobile phone\u2019s \u201cMind the Gap\u201d ringtone sounding repeatedly. He will earn \u00a3500,000 at Network Rail, where his first job is to review what parts of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/network-rail-funding-gap-scuppers-five-year-investment-plan\">\u00a338.5bn five-year plan</a> can actually be delivered. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jun/28/sir-peter-hendy-will-be-a-hard-act-to-follow-as-head-of-tfl\">Sir Peter Hendy will be a hard act to follow as boss of TfL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The electrification of two major lines through the Midlands and across the Pennines has been shelved. More projects are likely to follow.</p> <p>The job may have interrupted his eventual plans for a more convivial Brussels post, but he says: \u201cDoing a four-day week, and someone else in charge on a daily basis, is quite nice at the age of 62. That\u2019s not a bad outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Hendy will be doing double the workload of his predecessor, Richard Parry-Jones, and is a noted hands-on operator \u2013 raising questions about how his role will sit alongside chief executive Mark Carne.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do with his day off; at TfL he texts the mayor every single morning with an update, never off monitoring the system, even at weekends. Management may be, he says, about strategic visions, \u201cbut if I go round talking about London in 2030, no one gives a shit if you can\u2019t run the Northern Line to people\u2019s general satisfaction. If you can\u2019t demonstrate that the organisation can function on a daily basis, nothing else you talk about matters \u2013 so as a chief executive, watching how it performs is quite important\u201d.</p> <p>Network Rail\u2019s fundamental issues are similar to London\u2019s, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s high intensity, we no longer have an off-peak. When I started 40 years ago, if your bus service was up the creek at half past nine you\u2019d spend the rest of the morning putting it right so it would be OK in the evening \u2013 you don\u2019t get that luxury now. And people expect public services to be well provided and the people who run them to be pleasant and helpful.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve proved at TfL is that it is difficult, but you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>TfL has taken in some national rail services as part of London Overground, although Hendy warns that the latest extension east may take a while to improve. \u201cIt has been more difficult than we thought because the trains are in such a bad condition \u2013 the doors, the kit,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s been my life for 15 years. I\u2019m going to miss it a lot</p> <footer> <cite>Hendy on TfL</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>New trains have been ordered. But the leeway to run better services might be tested in years ahead. Hendy says a significant cut to the city\u2019s funding in the spending review is \u201cnot even likely, but certain\u201d, and his successors will have to work hard and ingeniously to manage the budget.</p> <p>He warns that promises of fare freezes from some London mayoral candidates for 2016 are unrealistic. \u201cKen [Livingstone] used to say,\u201d he adopts a nasal voice, \u201c\u2018you always want to put up the fares\u2019. I always do, because I want the money to spend on what we do.\u201d</p> <p>By 2019, Hendy says, London will be operating public transport without any kind of subsidy. \u201cThe bus service is a challenge: there is going to have to be some ingenuity to pay for that, because what you mustn\u2019t do is leave people behind.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how some of my predecessors managed: Camberwell New Road, you couldn\u2019t get on the bus for three quarters of an hour in the morning, because we couldn\u2019t afford to run buses. Not being able to afford sufficient peak services for people to get to work and kids to get to school is not good for the economic health of the city.\u201d</p> <p>TfL has taken some controversial measures, including ticket office closures, to balance the books. Hendy says this was not just costcutting: \u201cNow you don\u2019t even need an Oyster card,\u201d he says, pointing to his phone. \u201cYou can\u2019t envisage this place stuck in aspic when you\u2019ve got massive grant cuts.\u201d</p> <p>Boris Johnson trusted Hendy enough to keep him in the job when he was elected mayor, when many Tories were urging him to sack someone they saw as Livingstone\u2019s man; now Conservatives have entrusted him with digging Network Rail out of a crisis. Hendy says he is \u201cagnostic\u201d over rumoured quasi-privatisation plans. \u201cWhat matters to me is that it works well,\u201d he insists.</p> <p>The difference between Livingstone and Johnson, he says, was \u201cless than anyone supposes really. They\u2019ve got different philosophies, but the job of the mayor is surprisingly similar. They both grasped the essential nature of making the city work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/25/peter-hendy-network-rail-profile-london-bus-driver-olympics\">Peter Hendy: from London bus driver to transport's Olympic champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On buses, he says, Johnson has been \u201cjust as good\u201d, and even his spectacularly underused cable car escapes overt criticism. Hendy says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the biggest mandate of any politician in Britain, so if you say I\u2019m going to build a cable car, if the commissioner of transport thinks that\u2019s entirely the wrong idea and [you] shouldn\u2019t do it, he should piss off and let someone else do what the mayor wants.\u201d</p> <p>TfL spent millions drawing up plans for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/guardian-view-aviation-addiction-boris-johnson-airport\">Thames Estuary airport</a> that was icily dismissed by the Airports Commission chair, Sir Howard Davies, as having no support, bar the mayor\u2019s. Hendy refuses to comment: \u201cNo, you can ask Boris about that.\u201d </p> <p>But any airport expansion would need billions more spent on roads and rail than the commission acknowledges, he says \u2013 \u00a310bn-plus for Heathrow, or \u00a36bn for Gatwick.</p> <p>Generally, Hendy believes money has been well spent. Tube upgrades, such as the Victoria line, \u201cleave no one in any doubt we can spend the money correctly\u201d.</p> <p>Few say the same for Network Rail right now, which is why Hendy \u2013 even in the strange circumstances of his appointment \u2013 fits the bill. He certainly does not seem a man eager to leave. Asked what he will miss, he looks choked. \u201cI\u2019ll miss everything,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss this place terribly. It\u2019s been my life for 15 years. I\u2019m going to miss it a lot.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s efforts this week to stem the tide of losses on its main stock market failed on Friday when the Shanghai Composite index plunged a further 5.8%, taking the drop in share values to 28% since their June peak. Panic selling wiped more than \u00a32tn off the value of Chinese-listed companies and traders signalled the rout would extend into next week. The authorities had cut fees and eased borrowing rules that make it cheaper to buy shares in the hope it would cheer investors battered by the relentless selling since 12 June. A promise by the main stock market regulator to tackle concerns of market manipulation, which has sapped investor confidence in recent days, also failed to halt the slide. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the market watchdog, said it would launch an investigation into suspected stock market manipulation, without giving details of how long the probe would take or which organisations were under suspicion. In a further effort to shore up prices, the regulator cut the number of new companies coming on to the stock market by two-thirds. Ten initial public offerings will be allowed in July, the commission said on its blog account. It gave no details of which companies would be allowed to list but said the amount of money raised also would be reduced from June\u2019s level. Hexun.com, a financial news website, said 28 companies had planned to go public in the next two weeks. The latest moves followed a surprise interest rate cut on 27 June that was interpreted as a clear signal that Beijing wanted to shore up investor confidence. The explosive price rises that saw the stock market double in value began after the official media said last summer that stocks were cheap. Companies rushed to raise money with share offerings to take advantage of investor enthusiasm. Some analysts said the fall since last month was a belated symptom of China\u2019s economic woes after a slowdown in activity dating back to early last year. Manufacturing output and exports have slowed, while the finance ministry has clamped down on lending by state enterprises and local authorities for property speculation. Officially, GDP growth is expected to remain at 7% this year, in line with the government\u2019s target, but many analysts say that official figures overestimate actual growth and it is in fact nearer 3%. Stuart Kirk, a strategy analyst at Deutsche Bank, queried why regulators eased lending rules this week. He said: \u201cAfter all, shares are still up 90% since the lows in 2013 and valuations remain frothy. The reality, however, is most investors are in the red \u2013 in fact, it is likely no money has been made during this equity boom whatsoever. The reason is because peak inflows occurred just before the recent selloff; money lost by latecomers is greater than gains made by earlier investors.\u201d More than 20m trading accounts were opened between mid-April and mid-June to invest in the rising market and it is these accounts that have seen the biggest losses, he said. A prolonged slump could disrupt Communist party plans to use stock markets to make China\u2019s state-dominated economy more productive. The party wants state companies to raise money through share sales to reduce debt and hopes they will compete harder if they have to answer to shareholders. Party leaders also hope stock investing can provide an ageing population with more options to save for retirement and ease demand for social spending.",

    "webTitle": "Alwaleed bin Talal: meet the Saudi prince giving away all his money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is something that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia badly wants you to know: the exact amount of his wealth. In 2009, he invited a Forbes reporter to a week-long visit of his 420-room palace in Riyadh and to accompany him and his then wife, Princess Ameera, on a flight to Cairo on board his personal Boeing 747 to make sure the magazine realised the scale of his wealth when compiling the list of the richest people on the planet. That plan did not go well. In 2013, he launched a libel action against Forbes for underestimating his fortune. The magazine said he was worth $20bn, the 26th most wealthy billionaire in the world, but he claimed his fortune was much larger. After all, the 60-year-old member of the Saudi royal family and self-proclaimed Arabian Warren Buffett, is the wealthiest man in the Middle East, holding stakes in the likes of Apple, Twitter, Citigroup, Canary Wharf, Time Warner and Paris\u2019s George V and London\u2019s Savoy hotels. This week, the prince, who has a penchant for texting influential people and has James Murdoch on speed-dial, announced he will donate all his wealth to charity, including empowering women through his own Alwaleed Philanthropies organisation, modelled on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As he invited the world media for a briefing in Riyadh, he also used the opportunity to push his version of the size of his fortune, which he says is $32bn (\u00a320bn). That is still at odds with Forbes\u2019s 2015 estimate of $22.6bn, which puts him 34th on its list. Alwaleed, a nephew of King Salman and a grandson of Saudi Arabia\u2019s founder, Abdulaziz, is unlike other big Saudi princes. He often appears in public with his tinted glasses and wearing suits instead of the usual ankle-length thawb. The prince, who is obsessive about calorie counting and usually has no more than 1,100 a day, has progressive views on women, music and cinema and has called for the Arab world, Saudi monarchy included, to implement reform. He married the glamorous and unveiled Ameera years after she interviewed him for a school paper when she was 18. In a society where women are kept away from the limelight, he appeared with her in public \u2013 including at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 \u2013 and insisted on Saudi newspapers publishing her photos despite the usual restrictions on using Saudi women\u2019s images in print. The prince divorced Ameera in 2013, although they remain friends. He is happy to boast that his Saudi-based headquarters employ more women than men and that they don\u2019t have to wear veils at work. Not everyone believes that the prince\u2019s focus on women is solely aimed at empowering them; some critics say it is also a way for him to gain more influence, especially in the west. But there are limits to what money can buy, even if you are Alwaleed. In the 2000s, he famously financed a woman from Mecca, Hanadi Zakaria al-Hindi, to become his country\u2019s first female pilot. She was certified to fly in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and may be able to fly the prince\u2019s private jet (though it isn\u2019t clear if she does that in Saudi Arabian skies), but she surely won\u2019t be able to drive on Saudi streets. Women are still banned from doing so in the the world\u2019s most theocratic kingdom. Alwaleed and Ameera support the campaign to change that. Alwaleed was born in Jeddah, on the coast of the Red Sea, in March 1955. His father is Prince Talal, a senior member of the royal family who was sidelined \u2013 and even exiled \u2013 because he was seen as a black sheep for wanting a constitutional monarchy. Talal has recently been critical of the king empowering his son and centralising power around his son\u2019s house. Alwaleed\u2019s mother was Mona Al Solh, the daughter of Lebanon\u2019s first prime minister Riad Al Solh. He studied at Menlo college in California and later received an off-campus master\u2019s degree from Syracuse University. The prince says he is a self-made billionaire, claiming that his father only gave him a $30,000 endowment and a $300,000 loan and a house. It remains unclear how he was subsequently able to amass such a huge amount of money in a short time. His first investments were in construction and it was not until 1991, when he rescued the then fragile Citicorp, that the west came to know of his financial firepower. He has since come to the rescue of many other big companies and his wealth has grown at a startling rate, now stretching to a super yacht (which became the setting for a James Bond film and was once owned by Donald Trump), private jets (an A380 he later sold), countless acres of lands, and hotel giants Four Seasons and M\u00f6venpick. His Rotana group is the Arab world\u2019s largest entertainment company. His Kingdom resort outside Riyadh has a private zoo and an underground cavern, according to Vanity Fair. He is the chairman of Kingdom Holding, which controls many of his assets. Alwaleed\u2019s contact book bursts with A-listers, his diary is punctuated by meetings with the world\u2019s powerbrokers. He texted Carla Bruni when Nicolas Sarkozy lost the French presidential election in 2012. He is active on Twitter, where he has 3.35 million followers. His timeline is full of his pictures with the world\u2019s biggest names. The Murdoch clan are important associates. Alwaleed has a stake in Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and Rupert Murdoch has shares in the prince\u2019s Rotana Group. But in 2015, it emerged that Alwaleed was reducing his holdings from 6.6% to about 1%. During the phone-hacking scandal, Alwaleed stood by Murdoch\u2019s family but called for Rebekah Brooks to resign. She stepped down a day after the prince\u2019s intervention. \u201cJames [Murdoch] is not my partner only in News Corp,\u201d Alwaleed told Vanity Fair\u2019s William Cohan in 2013. \u201cHe\u2019s also my partner in the Rotana \u2026 He\u2019s a highly ethical, professional, decent man. I think of his honesty. I\u2019m thinking of him. I know him very well.\u201d Jane Kinninmont, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said it is not unknown for billionaires to give vast amounts of their money away, but she underlined the political and social prominence of Alwaleed in Saudi Arabia. \u201cHe is a very interesting figure politically and socially in the Saudi royal family,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of his media companies financed the film Wadjda, which is the first feature film directed by a Saudi woman shown at Cannes, so he has a history of making high-profile gestures which are surprising and which make him popular, at least with a liberal constituency.\u201d Alwaleed has been indirectly criticised by a number of conservative Saudi clerics for his satellite channels, for example. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a young man to be making such a [philanthropic] move, it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s coming to the end of his career or that he needed to look at his legacy,\u201d she added. \u201cSome people speculate that maybe he is someone with political ambition in Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s probably unlikely because he\u2019s so liberal, relative to that society. But having amassed so much wealth, he may well be interested in his reputation.\u201d Bill Gates, who has worked with the prince for charity, praised him for his latest move this week. Alwaleed, who likes watching CNBC and has given money to many universities \u2013 including Harvard, Cambridge and Edinburgh \u2013 has not been immune to controversies. Perhaps the most curious is his alleged retention of a group of dwarves as an act of charity. The prince has described reports of dwarf-tossing as lies. His supporters say he has shown a favour to the dwarves by giving them shelter and money. The prince, who frequently invited journalists to his palaces before, has since become somewhat press shy \u2013 at least to western media. Another big controversy was his plan to offer 100 Bentleys to 100 Saudi pilots involved in the military campaign against Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebel forces there has killed hundreds of civilians, among them children. Alwaleed is also believed to hold hostile views about Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main rival in the region. Other Saudi figures to benefit from his generous gifts include footballers. Not all his donations are gratefully received, though; his $10m cheque to New York after the 9/11 attacks was rejected by the city\u2019s mayor. Dean Mousavi, a human rights activist based in Iraq, said Alwaleed enjoys a surprising degree of respect in the region, even among Shia Muslims, because of his inclusive views of the Shia sect of Islam. But Mousavi is unsure what result giving such a large amount of money away will bring. \u201cIt gives him some publicity, which he wants to have in the west such as in the US and France,\u201d Mousavi said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about presenting a good image of himself in the world, but I\u2019m not sure where the money will go.\u201d Potted profile Born 7 March 1955 Age 60 Career He considers himself a self-made billionaire with wealth of around $32bn (\u00a320bn) and is the 34th richest person on the planet, according to Forbes. He is the chairman of Kingdom Holding and has holdings in everything from Apple and Twitter to London\u2019s Savoy hotel, as well as owning a 420-room Riyadh palace, a superyacht, and several jets. High point In 1991, he rescued the ailing Citicorp, investing $590m in a stake that is now worth billions. He is politically and socially liberal relative to conservative Saudi society, giving opportunities to women in a country where women are not allowed to drive. He has vowed to donate all his wealth to charity to help provide disaster relief, empower women and foster cultural understanding. Low point In April, he tweeted that he was offering luxury Bentley cars to Saudi pilots as a reward for their efforts in the military campaign against Yemen, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of civilians. What he says \u201cI don\u2019t make mistakes. I make blunders,\u201d he told Vanity Fair in 2013. \u201cWhen you make a mistake you lose $10m, $50m, $100m, but when you make a mistake of $200m to $500m, or $1bn, that\u2019s a blunder. So I\u2019ve made mistakes, blunders, but I learned from them \u2026 by not doing them again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> There is something that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia badly wants you to know: the exact amount of his wealth. </p> <p>In 2009, he invited a Forbes reporter <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/27/inside-prince-alwaleed-saudi-palace-business-billionaires-alwaleed.html\">to a week-long visit</a> of his 420-room palace in Riyadh and to accompany him and his then wife, Princess Ameera, on a flight to Cairo on board his personal Boeing 747 to make sure the magazine realised the scale of his wealth when compiling the list of the richest people on the planet. </p> <p>That plan did not go well. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/06/saudi-prince-libel-action-forbes-rich-list\">he launched a libel action</a> against Forbes for underestimating his fortune. The magazine said he was worth $20bn, the 26th most wealthy billionaire in the world, but he claimed his fortune was much larger. After all, the 60-year-old member of the Saudi royal family and self-proclaimed Arabian Warren Buffett, is the wealthiest man in the Middle East, holding stakes in the likes of Apple, Twitter, Citigroup, Canary Wharf, Time Warner and Paris\u2019s George V and London\u2019s Savoy hotels. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2013/mar/27/prince-alwaleed-not-happy-26th-richest-world\">Prince Alwaleed: why he's not happy to be the 26th richest person in the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week, the prince, who has a penchant for texting influential people and has James Murdoch on speed-dial, announced he will donate all his wealth to charity, including empowering women through his own Alwaleed Philanthropies organisation, modelled on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As he invited the world media for a briefing in Riyadh, he also used the opportunity to push his version of the size of his fortune, which he says is $32bn (\u00a320bn). That is still at odds with Forbes\u2019s 2015 estimate of $22.6bn, which puts him 34th on its list. </p> <p>Alwaleed, a nephew of King Salman and a grandson of Saudi Arabia\u2019s founder, Abdulaziz, is unlike other big Saudi princes. He often appears in public with his tinted glasses and wearing suits instead of the usual ankle-length thawb. The prince, who is obsessive about calorie counting and usually has no more than 1,100 a day, has progressive views on women, music and cinema and has called for the Arab world, Saudi monarchy included, to implement reform. <br></p> <p>He married the glamorous and unveiled Ameera years after she interviewed him for a school paper when she was 18. In a society where women are kept away from the limelight, he appeared with her in public \u2013 including at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 \u2013 and insisted on Saudi newspapers publishing her photos despite the usual restrictions on using Saudi women\u2019s images in print. The prince divorced Ameera in 2013, although they remain friends. <br></p> <p>He is happy to boast that his Saudi-based headquarters employ more women than men and that they don\u2019t have to wear veils at work. Not everyone believes that the prince\u2019s focus on women is solely aimed at empowering them; some critics say it is also a way for him to gain more influence, especially in the west.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e6f568637fbf414ec12d961493779a3a6ce280d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6f568637fbf414ec12d961493779a3a6ce280d/143_0_2032_3056/665.jpg\" alt=\"Alwaleed and his then wife, Ameera, at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alwaleed and his then wife, Ameera, at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Juinen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are limits to what money can buy, even if you are Alwaleed. In the 2000s, he famously financed a woman from Mecca, Hanadi Zakaria al-Hindi, to become his country\u2019s first female pilot. She was certified to fly in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and may be able to fly the prince\u2019s private jet (though it isn\u2019t clear if she does that in Saudi Arabian skies), but she surely won\u2019t be able to drive on Saudi streets. Women are still banned from doing so in the the world\u2019s most theocratic kingdom. Alwaleed and Ameera support the campaign to change that. <br></p> <p>Alwaleed was born in Jeddah, on the coast of the Red Sea, in March 1955. His father is Prince Talal, a senior member of the royal family who was sidelined \u2013 and even exiled \u2013 because he was seen as a black sheep for wanting a constitutional monarchy. </p> <p>Talal has recently been critical of the king empowering his son and centralising power around his son\u2019s house. Alwaleed\u2019s mother was Mona Al Solh, the daughter of Lebanon\u2019s first prime minister Riad Al Solh. He studied at Menlo college in California and later received an off-campus master\u2019s degree from Syracuse University. </p> <p>The prince says he is a self-made billionaire, claiming that his father only gave him a $30,000 endowment and a $300,000 loan and a house. It remains unclear how he was subsequently able to amass such a huge amount of money in a short time. </p> <p>His first investments were in construction and it was not until 1991, when he rescued the then fragile Citicorp, that the west came to know of his financial firepower. He has since come to the rescue of many other big companies and his wealth has grown at a startling rate, now stretching to a super yacht (which became the setting for a James Bond film and was once owned by Donald Trump), private jets (an A380 he later sold), countless acres of lands, and hotel giants Four Seasons and M\u00f6venpick. </p> <p>His Rotana group is the Arab world\u2019s largest entertainment company. His Kingdom resort outside Riyadh has a private zoo and an underground cavern, according to Vanity Fair. He is the chairman of Kingdom Holding, which controls many of his assets. </p> <p>Alwaleed\u2019s contact book bursts with A-listers, his diary is punctuated by meetings with the world\u2019s powerbrokers. He texted Carla Bruni when Nicolas Sarkozy lost the French presidential election in 2012. He is active on Twitter, where he has 3.35 million followers. His timeline is full of his pictures with the world\u2019s biggest names.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fb26e753241d47c197eaa887b33742bbe28acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fb26e753241d47c197eaa887b33742bbe28acd/60_50_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alwaleed with Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alwaleed with Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Murdoch clan are important associates. Alwaleed has a stake in Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and Rupert Murdoch has shares in the prince\u2019s Rotana Group. But in 2015, it emerged that Alwaleed was reducing his holdings from 6.6% to about 1%.</p> <p>During the phone-hacking scandal, Alwaleed stood by Murdoch\u2019s family but called for Rebekah Brooks to resign. She stepped down a day after the prince\u2019s intervention. \u201cJames [Murdoch] is not my partner only in News Corp,\u201d Alwaleed told Vanity Fair\u2019s William Cohan in 2013. \u201cHe\u2019s also my partner in the Rotana \u2026 He\u2019s a highly ethical, professional, decent man.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is worth more than Yahoo, Twitter or Netflix, it is the world\u2019s largest online travel agent and it owns the biggest internet business in western Europe \u2013 yet few people outside the US will have heard of Priceline Group. Much better known, however, are the brands this $60bn (\u00a340bn) online giant operates, including restaurant booker OpenTable, hotel finder Booking.com and Manchester-based Rentalcars.com. The group\u2019s success is based on 14,000 staff in call centres and offices around the world, speaking 42 languages collectively, and is evident in earnings forecasts 10 times the size of of Airbnb\u2019s this year \u2013 yet it receives a fraction of the attention of its more recently hatched competitor. \u201cThe size of our vacation rental business is as big as the whole of Airbnb,\u201d says Priceline\u2019s chief executive, Darren Huston. \u201cWe are a Dutch company so we don\u2019t go in the press a lot, we are less built around hype.\u201d Huston has two jobs, managing the group while also remaining head of Priceline\u2019s largest business, Booking.com, which is headquartered in Amsterdam. The vast majority of the group\u2019s revenues come from outside the US. It employs 2,500 people in Amsterdam, 2,000 in the UK, 3,000 in the US, and the rest are spread around the world, with hubs in Berlin and Singapore, where Priceline\u2019s Asian travel brand, Agoda, is headquartered. \u201cVacationing is far more important to Europeans than it is to Americans,\u201d says Huston. \u201cPeople here get five weeks, the average American gets two weeks, and only takes one. If you look at destinations, Europe holds a commanding lead collectively over any other part of the world.\u201d It is reflected in the figures \u2013 Priceline took $50bn in bookings last year, of which nearly 87% was outside the US. Its profits come from charging a commission \u2013 typically 15%. Although its online presence means Priceline is regarded as an internet stock \u2013 it is listed on the Nasdaq in New York \u2013 its defining feature is its big offline presence. The company operates much like a traditional travel agent, with three-quarters of the workforce dedicated to interacting with people \u2013 be they travellers or hotel and restaurant managers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of work that Microsoft would be naturally attracted to, or Google,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThey hope that somebody out there is doing this. They deal with ones and zeros and this is more the laying of the plumbing that allows all of that stuff to ultimately work. Fortunately we\u2019ve found a way to make what we do work. Because we do it at scale.\u201d Using people rather than computers to deal with customers may not be fashionable for internet companies, but Priceline has shown it can be profitable. The group\u2019s revenues were $8.4bn last year, and its income after tax $2.4bn. Type \u201cBooking.com customer service\u201d into a search engine, and the first thing that appears is not the dreaded list of frequently asked questions, but a phone number. During this summer\u2019s peak, Priceline Group will be directly employing about 5,000 people in call centres. And they are not based in Bangalore. In January, a 270-person centre opened in Canary Wharf. It is a 24-hour, seven-day operation, and every employee speaks English plus at least one other language. Priceline telephone operators can hold conversations in Icelandic, Estonian, Catalan, Serbian, Latvian or Slovak. A defining moment for Booking.com came five years ago, when its staff helped manage the travel chaos caused when an ash cloud from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland grounded air traffic across Europe for a week. More recently, staff have been dealing with the fallout from the Tunisian massacre. Huston says: \u201cPeople say: \u2018What are you thinking, why are you sticking a call centre in Canary Wharf or Amsterdam?\u2019 But what we need is multilingual people from many parts of the world. We can pretty much recruit all 42 languages in London, which you can\u2019t say about anywhere else in the world.\u201d The other half of the business deals with suppliers \u2013 helping hotels, car hire firms and restaurants come online. Its 165 offices around the world are busy signing up restaurants, hotels and car rental firms, handling pricing disputes, and helping small businesses smarten up online. \u201cWe tell them: \u2018You need this many high-definition photos, take a picture of the bathroom, don\u2019t take a picture of the girl lying on the bed with all the rose petals\u2019,\u201d says Huston. OpenTable, acquired last summer for $2.6bn, is preparing for an international push. It operates in the US and the UK, where most high-end restaurants taking bookings use its software. Sales staff go door to door, visiting six or seven restaurants a day, offering to replace the handwritten reservations book with a computer. Previously this involved hooking up a screen and a small server; today the software is in the cloud and can be accessed from a tablet. Headquartered in Connecticut, Priceline was founded in 1997, during what Huston refers to as the \u201cgimmicky, sock puppet\u201d era of the internet. Priceline\u2019s gimmick was letting the consumer name their price, and then have suppliers bid to meet it. In those days, the company sold everything from petrol to groceries and insurance. After the dotcom bubble burst, it narrowed its scope to airline tickets, hotels, car rentals and holiday packages, but expanded internationally, eventually buying Booking.com in 2005. Priceline.com became a subsidiary of a larger group, in which all six brands are run independently. So independently, in fact, that only 30 staff are employed by the overall group, and Huston spends just a third of his time on group functions as opposed to running Booking.com, which is by far the largest beast in the Priceline menagerie. Having held senior jobs at Starbucks and Microsoft before joining in 2011, Huston took over as group chief executive in January 2014, succeeding Jeffery Boyd, who turned Priceline around after the dotcom bust. \u201cI\u2019m like the guy who got appointed to run the family, but the family runs very independently,\u201d says Huston. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to over-integrate our acquisitions. We let entrepreneurs lead these companies for better or for worse. The cost of that is synergy potentially, but we have an allergy to coordinating. Synergy is a great word but it often comes as a distraction from the core purpose.\u201d Many of the founders have stayed on. The entrepreneurs who launched Kayak, Agoda, Booking and Rentalcars all still work for the group. What keeps them in the company? Not just the generous stock options. Priceline may be less famous than its internet peers, but the business has its attractions. \u201cWe are in the consumer internet, in travel. I mean, why would I want to do something different?\u201d This article was ammended on 7 July to say that Agoda is headquartered in Singapore and not Bangkok, as previously stated.",

The vast majority of the group\u2019s revenues come from outside the US. It employs 2,500 people in Amsterdam, 2,000 in the UK, 3,000 in the US, and the rest are spread around the world, with hubs in Berlin and Singapore, where Priceline\u2019s Asian travel brand, Agoda, is headquartered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"65fb5bf2ada7f3d990f0286c3231b73eb45aa4a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65fb5bf2ada7f3d990f0286c3231b73eb45aa4a2/0_107_3960_2377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priceline chief Darren Huston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priceline chief Darren Huston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cVacationing is far more important to Europeans than it is to Americans,\u201d says Huston. \u201cPeople here get five weeks, the average American gets two weeks, and only takes one. If you look at destinations, Europe holds a commanding lead collectively over any other part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>It is reflected in the figures \u2013 Priceline took $50bn in bookings last year, of which nearly 87% was outside the US. Its profits come from charging a commission \u2013 typically 15%.</p> <p>Although its online presence means Priceline is regarded as an internet stock \u2013 it is listed on the Nasdaq in New York \u2013 its defining feature is its big offline presence. The company operates much like a traditional travel agent, with three-quarters of the workforce dedicated to interacting with people \u2013 be they travellers or hotel and restaurant managers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of work that Microsoft would be naturally attracted to, or Google,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThey hope that somebody out there is doing this. They deal with ones and zeros and this is more the laying of the plumbing that allows all of that stuff to ultimately work. Fortunately we\u2019ve found a way to make what we do work. Because we do it at scale.\u201d</p> <p>Using people rather than computers to deal with customers may not be fashionable for internet companies, but Priceline has shown it can be profitable. The group\u2019s revenues were $8.4bn last year, and its income after tax $2.4bn.</p> <p>Type \u201cBooking.com customer service\u201d into a search engine, and the first thing that appears is not the dreaded list of frequently asked questions, but a phone number. During this summer\u2019s peak, Priceline Group will be directly employing about 5,000 people in call centres. And they are not based in Bangalore. In January, a 270-person centre opened in Canary Wharf. It is a 24-hour, seven-day operation, and every employee speaks English plus at least one other language. Priceline telephone operators can hold conversations in Icelandic, Estonian, Catalan, Serbian, Latvian or Slovak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fcee449e-132a-496d-8bf1-f49686960753\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435940569598/05cfc276-573e-4319-8f26-d6f8862b96e3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Iceland volcano\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For 39 days in 2010, Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull sent ash into European airspace, emptying the skies of planes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A defining moment for Booking.com came five years ago, when its staff helped manage the travel chaos caused when an ash cloud from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland grounded air traffic across Europe for a week.

We can pretty much recruit all 42 languages in London, which you can\u2019t say about anywhere else in the world.\u201d</p> <p>The other half of the business deals with suppliers \u2013 helping hotels, car hire firms and restaurants come online. Its 165 offices around the world are busy signing up restaurants, hotels and car rental firms, handling pricing disputes, and helping small businesses smarten up online. \u201cWe tell them: \u2018You need this many high-definition photos, take a picture of the bathroom, don\u2019t take a picture of the girl lying on the bed with all the rose petals\u2019,\u201d says Huston.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"65e327833404fc2a3efab002d90c8ecbbba1004a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e327833404fc2a3efab002d90c8ecbbba1004a/0_106_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priceline headquarters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The group has 14,000 staff in call centres and local offices around the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>OpenTable, acquired last summer for $2.6bn, is preparing for an international push. It operates in the US and the UK, where most high-end restaurants taking bookings use its software. Sales staff go door to door, visiting six or seven restaurants a day, offering to replace the handwritten reservations book with a computer. Previously this involved hooking up a screen and a small server; today the software is in the cloud and can be accessed from a tablet.</p> <p>Headquartered in Connecticut, Priceline was founded in 1997, during what Huston refers to as the \u201cgimmicky, sock puppet\u201d era of the internet. Priceline\u2019s gimmick was letting the consumer name their price, and then have suppliers bid to meet it. In those days, the company sold everything from petrol to groceries and insurance. After the dotcom bubble burst, it narrowed its scope to airline tickets, hotels, car rentals and holiday packages, but expanded internationally, eventually buying Booking.com in 2005. Priceline.com became a subsidiary of a larger group, in which all six brands are run independently.</p> <p>So independently, in fact, that only 30 staff are employed by the overall group, and Huston spends just a third of his time on group functions as opposed to running Booking.com, which is by far the largest beast in the Priceline menagerie.</p> <p>Having held senior jobs at Starbucks and Microsoft before joining in 2011, Huston took over as group chief executive in January 2014, succeeding Jeffery Boyd, who turned Priceline around after the dotcom bust.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m like the guy who got appointed to run the family, but the family runs very independently,\u201d says Huston. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to over-integrate our acquisitions. We let entrepreneurs lead these companies for better or for worse. The cost of that is synergy potentially, but we have an allergy to coordinating. Synergy is a great word but it often comes as a distraction from the core purpose.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f98e0da6-72f7-435e-aedf-50626040a4ca\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435940749832/6b2eaeed-aec8-490b-8bbf-360c20ab1c4f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The dining area of the Savoy Grill, one of the restaurants bookable via Priceline\u2019s OpenTable.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dining area of the Savoy Grill, one of the restaurants bookable via OpenTable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:   Antonio Olmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the founders have stayed on.

      "bodyText": "Greece in turmoil, Tunisia reeling from terrorism, France in the grip of a port blockade, Italy grappling with migrant tragedies out at sea. The Mediterranean crises are taking their toll on tourism as the peak summer period looms, but experts think the knock-on effect on each country will be very different. Thousands of planned trips to Tunisia have already been cancelled by Europeans aghast at the scenes of last week\u2019s terror attack in Sousse. Greece is also facing a slew of cancellations as holidaymakers fret about shortages of cash and other essentials. But Greece could yet survive the summer with its tourism industry relatively unscathed, experts say, while other countries, including Britain, might profit from the Mediterranean mayhem. It is a sensitive subject. As migrants risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean, and with Greece on the brink of financial chaos, the leisure plans of more well-heeled Europeans can understandably seem trivial. In May, for example, reports of British tourists angered at \u201cdisgusting\u201d migrant encampments on the Greek island of Kos prompted accusations of insensitivity. But it is also an important subject, not least for the nations being visited. The tourism industry contributes about 16% of Greece\u2019s GDP and almost 20% of its jobs, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. In Tunisia, where a jihadi gunman last week killed 38 people, 30 of them British, the figures are 15% and 14%. The attack is, not unexpectedly, having a major impact on people\u2019s plans to travel to Tunisia. The one element of hope is, experts say, that tourism industries can recover more quickly than one might expect. All around Europe, the package holiday firms that send the bulk of western visitors to Tunisia are offering people alternative destinations. In 2014 about 425,000 Britons visited Tunisia, almost as many as the 450,000 seen before the tumult of the Arab spring in 2011. On average, 400,000 Germans go to Tunisia each year, according to Torsten Sch\u00e4fer from the German Travel Association (GTA), but the Sousse attack will reduce that number this year. \u201cAs an aftershock, approximately 30% to 40% of people who were due to go in the next few days have chosen to cancel their holidays or rebook to travel to another country,\u201d he said. It was difficult to predict when the tourists would return, he added: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a brutal attack on a beach for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m not sure if people will forget that in the short term, but I hope for the young democracy this will happen because it was very stable.\u201d But Hidde van der Louw, from Dutch-based travel group Sundio, said Tunisia could look at the example of Egypt, where tourism numbers have risen again following the immediate post-Arab spring tumult in 2012 and 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how fast people forget,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some cases it\u2019s weeks or months, but it always comes back. It\u2019s all about what regions are offering and how they are developing \u2013 for example all-inclusive packages. Or it\u2019s about the political or economic situation, but those are short term.\u201d The situation for Greece seems more mixed. Even as the nation is on the brink of exiting the eurozone, the country appears as popular a destination as ever, albeit with a definite wobble before Sunday\u2019s referendum on austerity measures. The UK travel industry group Abta said there had been very few calls from concerned customers, but Britons are being advised to take sufficient cash with them because of possible disruption to banks. Some have even cancelled Tunisian holidays to head to Greece. Jess Stenson, a 19-year-old student from Birmingham was due to go with her boyfriend to a resort near the scene of the Tunisia attack in August, but took up holiday firm Thomson\u2019s offer of a switch to Corfu. \u201cIn terms of the crisis in Greece, I\u2019m not going until the end of August and a lot can happen in that time,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course we will take all the government advice \u2013 take plenty of euros, be careful of theft.\u201d Greece will host about 250,000 Scandinavians this summer, according to Nordic tour operator Ving, part of Thomas Cook \u2013 15% more than last year, the company says. Charlotte Hallencreutz of Ving in Stockholm said the company was already taking bookings for Greece next summer. \u201cThe crisis is not affecting our guests, Greece is still in demand,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who have booked later on this year still want to go. We are not seeing any change to our future bookings.\u201d Others are being more cautious. Richard Gussen from Corendon travel company said Greece had for years been among the most popular destinations for his Dutch customers, along with Turkey and Spain. \u201cThis year Greece was a bit more popular than Turkey, but in the last weeks we\u2019ve seen less bookings for the high season and instead there\u2019s been an increased demand for Spain and Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any cancellations, but for new bookings, people are waiting to see what happens this Sunday and what the situation is.\u201d Such caution appears to be growing. The head of the Greek tourist industry association, Andreas Andreadis, previously said there was no crisis in the country\u2019s tourism industry but conceded this week that the referendum and week-long closure of banks had seen hotel bookings dive by 50,000 a day. Nonetheless, Sch\u00e4fer from the GTA said he expected more German people to visit Greece this year than the record 2.5m from 2014. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any change in booking behaviour because people know there\u2019s a crisis in the financial system. On the islands, everything is fine and working. There are lots of people who have been there multiple times and go back every year because they know the weather will be the same, the hospitality is the same and the food is the same.\u201d Thomas Wilde, who runs a German travel PR company, said chaos was seen as a relative concept: \u201cThere is a tendency for people to go where they feel secure. In Greece, it\u2019s relatively secure and people calculate that there are no terror attacks and they are going to be able to get petrol and access healthcare if needed for their children \u2013 the problems are all to do with money; there\u2019s no fear of death.\u201d And what of the British? \u201cWith the exchange rate very much in favour of sterling, we are positive France will remain a favourite this summer,\u201d said Marine Catalogna from Atout France, the country\u2019s tourism agency, shrugging off ugly recent scenes in Calais that have threatened UK holidaymakers\u2019 passage to the country. However, with all the uncertainty, one much-touted holiday phenomenon looks like it might be set for a sudden boom: the staycation. The Canal &amp; River Trust says its members are reporting bumper booking figures this week. One, ABC Boat Hire, the largest canal boat hire operator in the UK, has seen a 44% increase in bookings compared with the same period last year. Upmarket camping holiday firm Canopy &amp; Stars, meanwhile, says its bookings more than doubled on 2014 levels over a recent 10-day period Nadejda Popova, a travel analyst at Euromonitor International, said there were 132m domestic tourism trips in Britain last year and that was expected to increase again. As well as difficulties elsewhere, she noted, there was a much more prosaic reason for this as well: stagnant salaries and a desire to save money.",

Richard Gussen from Corendon travel company said Greece had for years been among the most popular destinations for his Dutch customers, along with Turkey and Spain. \u201cThis year Greece was a bit more popular than Turkey, but in the last weeks we\u2019ve seen less bookings for the high season and instead there\u2019s been an increased demand for Spain and Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any cancellations, but for new bookings, people are waiting to see what happens this Sunday and what the situation is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e5336c49523d7df4f795a42789b73cd413f0559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e5336c49523d7df4f795a42789b73cd413f0559/53_0_3806_2284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man relaxes in the Mediterranean in Nice, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man relaxes in the Mediterranean in Nice, France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such caution appears to be growing. The head of the Greek tourist industry association, Andreas Andreadis, previously said there was no crisis in the country\u2019s tourism industry but <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/198811/article/ekathimerini/business/tourism-bookings-are-nosediving\">conceded this week</a> that the referendum and week-long closure of banks had seen hotel bookings dive by 50,000 a day.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sch\u00e4fer from the GTA said he expected more German people to visit Greece this year than the record 2.5m from 2014. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any change in booking behaviour because people know there\u2019s a crisis in the financial system. On the islands, everything is fine and working. There are lots of people who have been there multiple times and go back every year because they know the weather will be the same, the hospitality is the same and the food is the same.\u201d<br></p> <p>Thomas Wilde, who runs a German travel PR company, said chaos was seen as a relative concept: \u201cThere is a tendency for people to go where they feel secure. In Greece, it\u2019s relatively secure and people calculate that there are no terror attacks and they are going to be able to get petrol and access healthcare if needed for their children \u2013 the problems are all to do with money; there\u2019s no fear of death.\u201d</p> <p>And what of the British? \u201cWith the exchange rate very much in favour of sterling, we are positive France will remain a favourite this summer,\u201d said Marine Catalogna from Atout France, the country\u2019s tourism agency, shrugging off ugly recent scenes in Calais that have threatened UK holidaymakers\u2019 passage to the country.<br></p> <p>However, with all the uncertainty, one much-touted holiday phenomenon looks like it might be set for a sudden boom: the staycation. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.canalrivertrust.org.uk/\">Canal &amp; River Trust</a> says its members are reporting bumper booking figures this week. One, <a href=\"http://www.abcboathire.com/\">ABC Boat Hire</a>, the largest canal boat hire operator in the UK, has seen a 44% increase in bookings compared with the same period last year.<br></p> <p>Upmarket camping holiday firm <a href=\"http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/\">Canopy &amp; Stars</a>, meanwhile, says its bookings more than doubled on 2014 levels over a recent 10-day period</p> <p>Nadejda Popova, a travel analyst at <a href=\"http://www.euromonitor.com/\">Euromonitor International</a>, said there were 132m domestic tourism trips in Britain last year and that was expected to increase again. As well as difficulties elsewhere, she noted, there was a much more prosaic reason for this as well: stagnant salaries and a desire to save money.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lidl is considering a plan to sell wine online in the UK, a move that would give the discounter a new way to compete with its rivals. The rapid growth of internet orders has been helping the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets \u2013 Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 offset falling sales. Discount retailers have avoided home delivery and online sales because their business model is based on keeping operations simple and efficient to keep prices low for shoppers. Making profits from online sales has also proved difficult for supermarkets, as shoppers are unwilling to pay enough in delivery charges to cover costs. But with online grocery sales expected to more than double in value to \u00a317bn between 2014 and 2019, both Lidl and fellow German discounter Aldi are now exploring how to get a piece of that action. Both continue to steal market share from their bigger rivals, but have seen the pace of sales growth slow to 9% at Lidl and 15% at Aldi, down from 20% or more a year ago, according to the latest 12-week industry figures from analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Ben Hulme, head of beer, wine and spirits at Lidl\u2019s UK business, told trade journal the Drinks Business that he was keen on the plan. \u201cThe growth in wine is there to be seen and I would love to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t have the full picture in terms of the full complexity of what that would mean for the business.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are aware that online is a big category. There needs to be a lot of thought put into it. What we are not going to do is put up a half thought-out online shop. If we do it, we will consider it properly and do it properly.\u201d Hulme was behind Lidl\u2019s move into the premium wine market last year \u2013 a move labelled \u201cthe claret offensive\u201d \u2013 which was designed to woo more middle-class shoppers. It introduced a range of 48 wines, including vintage wine, at prices ranging from \u00a34.99 to \u00a321.99. And earlier this week it unveiled a new wine promotion, including a ros\u00e9 champagne at \u00a316.99 a bottle. Aldi has sold alcoholic drinks via the internet in Australia since 2013. It has yet to try any online service in Europe, but is also considering options for an online trial in the UK. Alcohol is a potential first step because of the relatively high value of bottles of wine, which might help offset delivery costs. Both Aldi and Lidl have also been using fine wines, champagne and beer as a way to broaden their appeal and attract more upmarket shoppers. Lidl sells more than 100 different wines, with 48 of those changing on a quarterly basis. Wine makes up 5% of the retailer\u2019s sales in the UK. The chain is also expanding its spirits range with single-malt scotch and a 34-year-old blended scotch for Christmas. Artisanal gin and vodka are also in development.",

      "bodyText": "A $500m spend to encourage the building of new dams and water storage projects is among measures unveiled on Saturday by the Abbott government in its long-anticipated agricultural competitiveness white paper. The government is claiming a headline investment of $4bn, but the new spend in the agriculture package is understood to be $1.2bn over four years. The policy wraps in a number of pre-existing initiatives, including the proposed regional spend on broadband infrastructure, and measures outlined in the recent budget. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, was due to launch the white paper with the prime minister on Saturday and then spend a week on the road selling the measures in regional Australia. The white paper confirms the government has allocated $250m a year over 11 years for concessional loans providing support for farmers in times of drought. That package translates to a $2.5bn spend, but farmers repay the money to the commonwealth. It also allocates an additional $29.9m for farm insurance and risk assessment grants. The new policy includes $114m for a new commissioner at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) dedicated to promoting fair competition in the farm sector. The new ACCC farm commissioner will be given a mandate to encourage fair trading and also strengthen competition in agricultural supply chains, and a $13.8m pilot program will give farmers information on cooperatives, collective bargaining and also support contract negotiations. There are investments in pest and disease eradication and in research and development. The spending on water security is broken up into $50m for planning work \u201cand $450m to construct national water infrastructure in partnership with state and territory governments and the private sector\u201d. The government\u2019s recent northern Australia white paper also allocated $200m for dam building and other water storage options. The launch of the agriculture white paper was initially scheduled for release in late 2014, but the process became bogged down because of arguments within the government about the level of funding to be attached to the initiative. There were also objections to some of the policy options floated in earlier iterations. In addressing the delays, the prime minister has said it was more important to get the policy right than launch it too early. But Labor has criticised the long gestation. \u201cNow six months late, Labor welcomes the imminent release of the agriculture white paper,\u201d Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s now over to you, Barnaby, to deliver for the farm sector.\u201d",

At the end of trading at China Minzu Securities, the brokerage in Jing\u2019an neighbourhood, Shanghai, where Zhang comes to trade, there was a sense of resignation rather than panic.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Crowded planes. Pinched seating. Vanishing fare bargains. Extortionate fees. Rising fares across every major airline. The antitrust cops at the US justice department think they know what\u2019s behind the blight of modern air travel: \u201cMajor airlines, in tandem, have raised fares, imposed new and higher fees, and reduced service.\u201d The government also accused America\u2019s leading airline companies of a preference for \u201ctacit coordination over full-throated competition\u201d. Except those words did not arrive this week, when documents surfaced indicating a justice department investigation into unlawful coordination by the airlines over pricing and capacity. Those suspicions of collusion came alongside a federal lawsuit almost two years ago, before the merger of American Airlines and USAirways created the world\u2019s largest air carrier and, industry watchers said at the time, ended any hope for a competitive industry that could lower ballooning ticket costs for consumers. Now, the surviving quartet of US airline giants \u2013 American, Delta, United and the discounter Southwest \u2013 are coming under increased scrutiny for \u201cunlawful coordination\u201d on price-gouging. But airline insiders and legal analysts say the government\u2019s case against the industry will be near-impossible to prove \u2013 indeed, that the feds have known about potential ticket schemes for years and have not been able to fight back against lobbyists fighting to bring the transportation business back from the post-9/11 brink. \u201cIt\u2019s de facto collusion,\u201d said Charles Leocha, president of Travelers United, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cFlights are full, and the airlines have become very good at signaling their strategy\u201d to their not-so-arch rivals, he added. While the justice department refused to elaborate on the leaked details of its investigation, the airlines did confirm that they have been asked to turn over reams of documents about their discussions on capacity, not just among themselves but with Wall Street analysts who have cheered the airlines\u2019 recent string of profits. The antitrust division tried to block the American-USAirways deal in 2013, but allowed it to proceed in exchange for concessions such as giving up choice airport slots to competitors like JetBlue. Even with Southwest remaining a discount outlier to American, Delta and United, four major companies now control more than 80% of all air travel out of the domestic United States \u2013 and, through their global alliances, wield influence on fares and flights around the world. Fifteen years ago, 10 large airlines carried 90% of domestic traffic. The competition cops have continued to use the airlines\u2019 own words against them: executives repeating the phrase \u201ccapacity discipline\u201d \u2013 code for restricting the number of available seats to ticket-buyers \u2013 is what renewed attention from critics like Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, who compiled a damning list of utterances at a recent summit of global airline chiefs and appears to have accelerated the probe. But watchdogs say the companies can still get their way on coordinated ticket prices without cutting a trust-busting deal, by keeping the number of seats they offer low \u2013 and keeping prices high. \u201cWhen there are a small number of competitors, it is easy for them to agree not to compete head to head,\u201d said Christopher Sagers, a professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law who testified at a congressional hearing on the 2013 merger. In recent years, the average airfare has risen by more than 10%, while capacity slid by nearly 20%. But planes are more full than at any time since the beginning of the jet age, with load factor \u2013 or percentage of seats filled \u2013 currently averaging 83%, up from 71% in 2000. But even if the airlines appear to move in lockstep on prices and capacity changes, that does not prove they are conspiring, said Helen Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cBecause of technology, everyone has perfect knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cAirlines know when their competitors change prices.\u201d Capacity changes usually follow the gross domestic product, she noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d The airlines, meanwhile, deny the accusations of collusion and insist they will fight any potential charges. \u201cWe are confident that the Justice Department will find what we know to be true: our members compete vigorously every day, and the traveling public has been the beneficiary,\u201d the Airlines for America trade group said in a statement. The lobbyists also said that capacity is at a \u201cpost-recession high\u201d, with airlines increasing the number of available seats by 4.6%, or 126,000 per day, during the summer travel period; as a result, the group claims, \u201cfares are actually down thus far in 2015\u201d. Industry defenders point to cumulative losses of $55bn in what they call the \u201clost decade\u201d after 9/11, when the airlines lurched from crisis to crisis, including a dramatic spike in oil prices and the financial crisis of 2008. Virtually every major US airline has been in bankruptcy at some point since the 2001 plane hijackings, only turning the corner recently with $22bn in profits over the past five years. American Airlines posted a record profit of $1.2bn in the first quarter of this year, as the last major carrier to go through the post-9/11 wash-and-rinse cycle. Indeed, airlines have begun to add more flights, which analysts say might be what set off the eyebrow-raising chatter about restoring \u201cdiscipline\u201d after Wall Street effectively punished airlines for their largesse, pushing down stock prices. An airline industry under the microscope is not good news for investors, with some pro-airline analysts claiming the feds simply do not understand the business. Michael Derchin, transportation analyst at CRT Capital, said that even in good times airlines\u2019 profit margins traditionally are razor-thin and that oil prices, now relatively low, could spike at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cWhat do you want them to do,\u201d he asked, \u201cgo out of business again?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally..... Tsipras says MPs will be asked to vote on the old bailout proposal, if the referendum result is Yes. But how, I wonder, will will his party vote? Anyway, that\u2019s the end of the interview (highlights start here) And (for the second time) the end of this blog. See you tomorrow. Back in the Greek PM\u2019s office, Tsipras denies that he\u2019s attempting a coup with his referendum (as the opposition claimed). He\u2019s also calling out the media for being biased in favour of the Yes campaign; the interviewer points out that Syriza MPs get on TV too. Constantine Michalos, head of the Hellenic Chambers of Commerce, doesn\u2019t think the Greek banks are going to open again on Tuesday. He\u2019s told the Telegraph that: \u201cWe are reliably informed that the cash reserves of the banks are down to \u20ac500m. Anybody who thinks they are going to open again on Tuesday is day-dreaming. The cash would not last an hour,\u201d Tsipras is now repeating what his finance minister told Bloomberg this morning - that a No vote will be followed by fresh negotiations, and a deal. (This probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if the referendum had been called earlier, though - it was the imminent end of the bailout programme that forced the ECB to act) My decision to call a referendum prompted the IMF to release its debt sustainability analysis, argues Tsipras. Tsipras suggests that the International Monetary Fund could have piped up earlier: (aside: If the IMF has known for a while that Greece needs a \u20ac50bn bailout, and debt relief, did it make this clear during negotiations?) And on the issue of the hour, Alexis Tsipras is adamant that a new bailout must include debt restructuring .....echoing the IMF, of course. ...followed by a nice pop at his predecessors (such as Antonis Samaras, who blasted Tsipras on Bloomberg TV today) A punchy soundbite: No early surprises from Alexis Tsipras in tonight\u2019s speech (online here). He\u2019s insisting that Greeks will be voting for Democracy and justice in Europe on Sunday (if they vote no). OXI does not equal Grexit, he vows. And he\u2019s also repeating his criticism of Greece\u2019s lenders, for failing to compromise: Oh, one last thing...Alexis Tsipras is giving an interview on Antenna TV now. It\u2019s being streamed live here. We\u2019re keeping an eye for any major announcements... The Greek government has just announced that a number of leading musicians, singers and actors will stage a concert when a huge \u201cno\u201d rally is held in Syntagma square in front of the parliament tomorrow night, reports Helena Smith. \u201cThe big no rally will be a big festival of the people,\u201d the ruling radical left Syriza party announced in a statement. \u201cWe will respond to the scene of fear that they want to impose with our songs, with our strong voice.\u201d \u201cIn Sunday\u2019s referendum with a proud OXI (no) we will write history. We will say the OXI of our life in order for life to emerge victorious.\u201d What is sure is that the language is becoming ever more colourful. Meanwhile Aegean Airways has also just announced that it will be putting on extra flights to enable Greeks living in London and Brussels to vote in Sunday\u2019s plebiscite. There will be additional flights on Sunday and Monday it says - and at cut prices: \u20ac199 return to Brussels and \u00a3148 return to London. And on that note we\u2019ll close up for the evening, pending any major developments later. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow, counting down to Sunday\u2019s key referendum. John Hooper has been sounding out voters in the villages of Corinthia. Read his piece here: Voters won\u2019t be able to miss this: Even a yes vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum may not be enough to keep Greece in the euro, says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. Commenting on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s report, he says: The IMF\u2019s DSA (debt sustainability analysis) for Greece offers a stark reminder of the challenges faced by all those involved in this horrid tragedy. It points to an enormous need for economic reforms by a country that \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 has had huge difficulties sustaining a less ambitious effort under several governments. It speaks to the need for Europe to bite the bullet and deliver a credible \u201cdebt operation\u201d (which, most probably, would involve debt forgiveness, the very mention of which has proven an anathema to some European governments). And all this would need to happen if the IMF (and soon, possibly, also the ECB) is to stand a chance of being paid back in a full and more timely fashion. While all sides are likely to use the IMF\u2019s DSA to bolster their case ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum, it is increasingly possible that even a \u201cyes\u201d vote would prove insufficient to maintain the country\u2019s membership of the European single currency. Every single day, an already challenging situation on the ground is slipping further away from the ability of politicians, whether in Greece or elsewhere in Europe, to deliver outcomes. European markets have ended lower ahead of the key Greek referendum decision at the weekend, with an exception being the FTSE 100 which has been lifted by BP agreeing to pay US authorities around $18.7bn relating to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. ECB board member Josef Bonnici said the terms of any future emergency funding it offered to Greek banks - including the amount of collateral - would depend on the outcome of the referendum. Asked by reporters in Milan if a win for the no supporters meant the emergency liquidity assistance would end, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the result is.\u201d He added that the ELA was not an infinite fund. (Quotes via Reuters) Over in Athens the Greek government spokeman, Gavriel Sakellarides, has reacted to the onslaught of support former prime ministers have made for the yes campaign today. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Growing numbers in the governing Syriza party are now saying openly that the no campaign is being deliberately targeted by what the left-leaning paper Syntaktwn described as \u201ca machine of terror\u201d in its front page splash today. Echoing those sentiments, the government spokeman issued the following statement. \u201cWe are watching a crush of former prime minister and political figures rushing to defend a yes vote to the proposal of lenders. That\u2019s their right.\u201d \u201cHowever it is also the right of the people not to forget them. And to decide over their dignity and interests undistracted from the blackmail and unprecedented propaganda.\u201d Syriza took the step this afternoon of expanding its no campaign beyond the borders of Greece by publishing a \u201cletter of solidarity to the Greek people\u201d signed by 400 Italian academics. Earlier, it published a proclamation signed by 300 members of the academy in Greece also supporting the government\u2019s no campaign. \u201cIn the referendum on Sunday 5th July we will vote OXI (No),\u201d the academics said. \u201cBecause we can no longer bear to see Greek society collapsing under the weight of the merciless continuation of the policies of austerity that manifestly is leading the economy ever more deeply into the vicious cycle of recession from which it is never going to emerge.\u201d Greece\u2019s banks have come under more pressure from ratings agencies, not altogether surprisingly. Fitch has downgraded the long-term senior debt rating of National Bank of Greece and Eurobank Ergasias from CCC to CC. Meanwhile Moody\u2019s says it has put the ratings of National Bank of Greece, Piraeus Bank, Eurobank Ergasias, Alpha Bank and Attica Bank on review for a possible downgrade. Nick Kounis at ABN Amro thinks the IMF could be underplaying Greece\u2019s problems: And here\u2019s our report on the IMF\u2019s pronouncements: Our correspondent Phillip Inman has read the IMF document and highlights some of the juicest segments. He says: \u201cThe IMF admits the deterioration in Greece\u2019s financial position means is not in a position to cope with debt repayments for at least three years, even with a debt write-off. It said: \u201cEven with concessional financing through 2018, debt would remain very high for decades and highly vulnerable to shocks.\u201d This would entail a much longer period before debt repayments are due and a longer period to pay them off. The IMF said: \u201cGiven the fragile debt dynamics, further concessions are necessary to restore debt sustainability. As an illustration, one option for recovering sustainability would be to extend the grace period to 20 years and the amortization period to 40 years on existing EU loans and to provide new official sector loans to cover financing needs falling due on similar terms at least through 2018.\u201d Just days ahead of the Greek referendum, the International Monetary Fund has said the struggling country needs \u20ac50bn of extra funds over the next three years. It also requires large scale debt relief to create \u201ca breathing space\u201d and stabilise the economy. Larry Elliott and Phillip Inman write: With three days to go before a knife-edge referendum, the IMF revealed a deep split with Europe as it warned that Greece\u2019s debts were \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Fund officials said they would not be prepared to put a proposal for a third Greek bail out package to the Washington-based organisation\u2019s board unless it included both a commitment to economic reform and debt relief. According to the IMF, Greece should have a 20-year grace period before making any debt repayments and that final payments should not take place until 2055. The IMF\u2019s analysis will be seized upon by Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, who has been insisting that he will only agree to tough new austerity measure if Greece is granted debt relief. Full story to follow. Greece\u2019s four largest banks would have failed and defaulted without this week\u2019s capital controls due to deposit withdrawals and the European Central Bank\u2019s decision not to raise the emergency funding cap, according to Fitch Ratings. The agency said: The Greek banking system\u2019s liquidity and solvency positions are very weak and some banks may be nearing a point where resolution [intervention to manage the failure of a firm in an orderly fashion] becomes a real possibility. The ECB is responsible for supervising and authorising the four major Greek banks, and the Bank of Greece is resolution authority for the others. Resolution of Greek banks, if required, is unlikely to be straightforward. We believe it would be politically unacceptable to impose losses on Greek creditors and that efforts would be made to find a solution which avoids this but still complies with EU legislation. Existing bank resolution laws in Greece are relatively mature, sharing many similarities with the EU\u2019s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, although they exclude explicit bail-in of senior unsecured creditors. And it concludes on a grim note: A swift lifting of capital controls is highly unlikely even if there is successful resumption of negotiations with the ECB, IMF and European Commission. Controls on Cypriot banks, lifted in May, lasted two years. The full statement is here: Fitch: Many Challenges If Resolution Needed On Greek Banks Some responses to our Guardian Witness call out for people to share their experiences in Greece at the moment. In some ways life is continuing as normal: Elsewhere ( in this case Trikala) there are clear signs of the opposing views in the country ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum: The European Central Bank plans to meet on Monday to discuss provision of emergency funding to Greek banks, according to Reuters. The current cap is \u20ac85bn, and a decision on whether to continue it or freeze it looks likely to be made quickly once the referendum result is known. In this mini-documentary Phoebe Greenwood meets the no and yes voters in Athens, as well as businesses affected by the continuing crisis and an academic who says referenda are a dangerous way of making decisions. And the Greek referendum website is live: Here\u2019s our story by Jennifer Rankin on the pledge by Yanis Varoufakis to resign if the country votes yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum: Greece\u2019s finance minister has pledged to resign if his country votes yes to the bailout plan proposed by international lenders. Yanis Varoufakis, the academic-turned-minister who has riled his eurozone counterparts, said he would not remain finance minister on Monday if Greece voted yes. In an interview with Bloomberg, the self-declared \u201cerratic Marxist\u201d said he would rather cut off his arm than accept another austerity bailout without any debt relief for Greece. However, he was \u201cquite confident\u201d that the Greek people would back the government\u2019s call for a no vote. The full story is here: Only three days to go now until the referendum, and in this Guardian video columnist Jonathan Freedland and economics editor Larry Elliott consider the last few turbulent days and look ahead to Sunday\u2019s vote: The opinion poll which showed the Yes campaign at 47% and the No campaign at 43%, is not as straightforward as first thought. GPO, the polling company which carried it out, has released a statement which says the survey was released without its permission, and is only a fragment of its research. GPO says that it takes \u201cno responsibility\u201d for the release of the poll, and will use all legal means at its disposal to protect its interests. GPO adds that it is important that polling results should always be conducted in a \u201cresponsible and comprehensive manner\u201d, including during this \u201ccritical decision of Greek people\u201d. Here\u2019s the statement. So, it\u2019s not clear whether the 47%-43% result is wrong. Or just part of a wider set of results which hasn\u2019t been released. I\u2019ve put a call into GPO, so we may get more info later.... My colleague Jon Henley is tweeting from Greece, showing a gift shop with a stiff upper lip: Syriza has called on Greeks to attend a \u201cNo\u2019 rally on Friday night, at 7:30pm local time (5.30pm BST). Athens will be crowded tomorrow night, with a \u2018Yes\u2019 rally also taking place. Another former Greek PM, Antonis Samaras, has just spoken on Bloomberg TV, and called for a Yes vote. Samaras says that Sunday\u2019s referendum is a straight choice between the euro and the drachma. We won\u2019t let Alexis Tsipras take us back to the drachma, says Samaras. That would be disastrous -- it would kill the economy, and also kill the hopes of the Greek people. Tsipras told voters that the country would be unrecognisable in six months - well he\u2019s achieved that, adds Samaras (who may still be smarting about being ousted by Syriza in January). A former Greek prime minister, Kostas Karamanlis, has just called for people to vote Yes to preserve the country\u2019s place in Europe. In a TV interview, Karamanlis - PM from 2004-2009 - warned that a No result would be the first step towards leaving the eurozone. In a sign of mounting tension in the Greek government, three members of the junior coalition party, Independent Greeks, have distanced themselves from the referendum. The Greek Kathimerini newspaper says: Last Saturday when I voted in favor of the referendum I had assurances that there would be no capital controls,\u201d noted Larissa MP Vassilis Kokkalis, on Thursday, adding that he did not have a mandate for closed banks. A second MP, Costas Damavolitis, has now urged voters to tick the \u2018yes\u2019 box to stay in the eurozone. And a third, Piraeus MP Dimitris Kammenos, has released a statement called for the withdrawal of the referendum. Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith says a Yes vote would almost certainly trigger political movement, with Tsipras\u2019 own role in government highly questionable. Whether resounding or not, a yes vote would make it high nigh impossible for the government to continue in its present make-up. Some form of change - be it elections, the creation of a national unity cross-party government or the formation of a Mario Monti-style administration led by technocrats - would become inevitable. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 candid announcement that he would rather resign than put his name to an agreement with creditors that did not deal with the issue of the country\u2019s unsustainable debt burden, gives a taste of what will follow if the no camp is defeated. What was not conveyed, however, was the extraordinary influence Varoufakis exerts on Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, who has to the last followed his finance minister\u2019s agenda of game theory and brinkmanship in dealing with the EU and IMF. The young premier has stuck by Varoufakis despite his closest aides, and reportedly even the deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, disagreeing vehemently with the way negotiations have been conducted since the fiasco euro group in Riga on April 24. Many blame the academic-turned politician personally for the isolation Greece now finds itself in internationally. \u201cThere are many who would rather he had done things differently,\u201d a senior government official told me this week. Should Varourfakis go, it might only be a matter of time before Tsipras also stepped down. On Monday the leftwing leader hinted that he might do as much in an interview with state run TV, highlighting the extent to which Sunday\u2019s referendum is also about Syriza and its battle for survival in power. According to Reuters, Greek state minister Nikos Pappas has told journalists that the banks will reopen \u201cas soon as we get an agreement.\u201d You can use GuardianWitness to share your experiences of what\u2019s going on in Greece today.

Over in Brussels, the EC\u2019s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas has confirmed that talks with Athens are now on ice until Greece has voted on its future on Sunday. Sky News Europe correspondent, Rob Nisbet, reports that the yes campaign is dominating TV adverts in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s poll. Over in Athens, polls this morning polls are suggesting that Sunday\u2019s referendum will be a close run thing. The difference in support between the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d camps so narrow that the result is essentially too close to call. A GPO poll released by euro2day.gr suggested this morning a \u201cyes\u201d vote - ballots cast by Greeks who believe that country must remain in the euro zone at any cost - would prevail with 47 % saying they would cast such ballots. However, 43% (with the vast majority being supporters of the governing Syriza party) said they would back the government\u2019s call for a \u201cno\u201d vote that would reject the harsh austerity imposed by foreign lenders on Greece. But that number is far from assured as the margin of error in the poll was 3.1 percentage points, and three days left for people to change their minds. Last night, Greece\u2019s fiery parliament president Zoe Konstantopoulou denounced what she described as the \u201cextreme intervention\u201d of those now wanting to cancel the popular vote. \u201cYes means yes to ultimatums,\u201d she said, calling on Greeks to vote No and \u201crepulse this latest intimidation\u201d. Laying out the arguments, Konstantopoulou, a prominent figure on Syriza\u2019s far left who has become ever more vocal despite her position as head of the 300-seat parliament said: \u201cYes means yes to \u2026 submission, unemployment, insecurity, endless taxes, the undermining of the Greek economy. People will say NO to artificial dilemmas, no to the strangulation of people by closed banks, no to the slavery of member-states, no to economic and political subordination.\u201d He\u2019s not resigned yet, Stan! Vassilis Korkidis, who heads the National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce, has also heard talk that the banks may indeed run out of cash by Monday (as The Times reports today). Korkidis told our correspondent Helena Smith yesterday that the Greek economy is grinding to a halt. \u201cNo one trusts anyone anymore, so no transactions are taking place between wholesale and retail.\u201d With just \u20ac1.5bn euro in reserves on Friday - and the cash being fast depleted - it is far from assured that banks will be able to open after the referendum on Tuesday. \u201cThe Greek prime minister [Tsipras] is telling lies when he says the banks will open soon,\u201d Stavros Theodorakis who heads the pro-European Potami party told SKAI TV. \u201cHow will the banks open? Who will give money and this problem is going to affect poor people. Besides the rich have taken their money overseas.\u201d It\u2019s too late to reprint Sunday\u2019s ballot papers. But if they could, the question could be changed to \u201cDo you want a new finance minister?\u201d In three little words, Yanis Varoufakis has now made the referendum about himself \u2013 and in a way he was right to. Greeks must now decide whether the \u201csustainable deal\u201d that Varoufakis has been banging on about for months is really achievable. Or is the offer on the table last week the best that Greece can get? And there really is no way back now -- with Varoufakis insisting he\u2019d rather \u2018cut his arm off\u2019 than sign a deal that doesn\u2019t include debt relief. Varoufakis also remains amazingly confident that a deal could be agreed quickly, if Greece votes no. Will creditors really wake up on Monday morning, see Greece has backed its government, and quickly agree a new deal including debt relief? If they don\u2019t, the ECB has no reason to turn on liquidity to the banks again, right? The \u20ac89bn question.... And Varoufakis came as close as possible to confirm that he believes Berlin is out to get Tsipras. \u201cYou may very well think that, I couldn\u2019t possibly comment\u201d indeed.... Have you spoken to Alexis Tsipras about whether he\u2019d resign? This is no time to talk about defeat, says Varoufakis (just minutes after saying his own job is on the line!!). We\u2019re going to win on Sunday, we\u2019re going to be here... he insists Remarkable interview, well done Guy Johnson and Bloomberg. Reaction to follow..... Why haven\u2019t we seen you at the cash machines, Mr Varoufakis? I\u2019ve been rather busy, for one thing. But yes, my wife and I must be the only people who haven\u2019t queued up. It feels \u2018inappropriate\u2019, Varoufakis adds, but suggests we shouldn\u2019t personalise the issue. Bloomberg\u2019s Guy Johnson suggests that people may doubt that Varoufakis is here for the long haul..... I left a job at the University of Texas to come here, Varoufakis replies. And even if he does resign as finance minister, he\u2019ll still be an MP. Varoufakis says he\u2019s confident that the Greek people will vote No. And he denies that a No vote will lead to Grexit. Greeks want to stay in the euro, so they need to decide the best way to achieve that -- with a sustainable deal or an unsustainable one. He\u2019s insisting that Greece\u2019s creditors will be prepared to negotiate with him on a third bailout programme, if Greece votes No. And we could have an agreement quickly. Do you think Angela Merkel is seeking regime chance? I\u2019ll quote from a BBC programme, Varoufakis smiles: You may very well think that, I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. [that\u2019s the Original (and quite brilliant) House of Cards, of course] But do you think other European governments don\u2019t want to work with you? You don\u2019t need to ask that, it\u2019s self-evident, Varoufakis says. All the centrist parties campaigned against us before January\u2019s election. Have they lost trust in you? No, Varoufakis argues, it\u2019s because they trust that we WILL deliver on our promises. Yanis Varoufakis says that the proposal which creditors posed last week will \u201ccertainly be on the table\u201d next week if the Greek people vote Yes on Sunday. But maybe there will be changes within the Greek government, Varoufakis suggests. Personally I will not sign a new \u201cextend and pretend\u201d agreement that doesn\u2019t learn from the mistakes of the past, and tackle vital issues such as debt sustainability. Bloomberg\u2019s Guy Johnson tries to nail Varoufakis down on the consequences of Sunday\u2019s vote. Are you saying that if there is a Yes vote on Sunday, you will not be finance minister on Monday night? I will not. But I will help whoever is, to push the agreement through there, Varoufakis adds, pointing at the Athens parliament. And he reiterates that he doesn\u2019t have the \u201cmoral right\u201d to sign a deal that doesn\u2019t include debt restructuring. What are the consequences of a yes vote, or a no verdict? We have said if there\u2019s a Yes, we will sign the deal that was on offer on the dotted line, says Varoufakis. We are unreconstructed democrats, after all And if there is a No, we will start talks on a new agreement, and \u201cbelieve you me, there will be an agreement.\u201d But how can the ECB let your banks reopen, by raising the ELA limits, on Monday, as Greece won\u2019t be in a bailout programme? The ECB has been making the rules up since this crisis began, says Varoufakis. What else was Mario Draghi\u2019s \u201cWhatever it takes\u201d speech in 2012? We politicians need to give Mario Draghi and the ECB the chance to make the right decision. Yanis Varoufakis is on Bloomberg now. Will the Greek banks open on Tuesday? Absolutely, says Varoufakis. This is not like Cyprus in 2013 - this is not a banking crisis. Europe has taken a \u201cPolitical decision to shut the banks down\u201d as a way to force Greece to accept a non-viable decision. Once we have given our verdict on Sunday, the banks will reopen. Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis about to be interviewed on Bloomberg TV. It will be streamed live here I\u2019ll cover the key points. Greece could be in a real pickle by the time Sunday\u2019s referendum is held. One banking insider has told The Times that banks might start to run dry before the end of the weekend. Mario Draghi\u2019s massive stimulus programme just ratcheted up another notch. The European Central Bank has just announced that it is expanding its QE bond-buying programme, to include corporate bonds issuers. That will help the ECB keep pumping liquidity into the markets, which could be very valuable if the Greek crisis really hits the markets. The ECB is committed to buying \u20ac60bn of debt each month, with newly created euros, until September 2016. Greek journalist Omaira Gill has tweeted pictures from an Athens supermarket yesterday, showing heavy demand for basic goods. She also shows that the situation remained calm in the historic area of old Athens earlier this week: Christine Lagarde has punctured hopes of early debt relief for Greece. In an interview with Reuters, the IMF chief said that it would be \u201cpreferable to see a deliberate move towards reforms\u201d, before tackling the issue of Athens\u2019s debt pile Here\u2019s the story, by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels: Don\u2019t forget, though, that the IMF\u2019s own research shows that Greece has no chance of hitting the target of cutting debt \u201cwell below 110% of GDP by 2022\u201d The Greek limbo extends to the financial markets, where the main indices are broadly flat in early trading. FTSE 100: down 2 points at 6606 German DAX: up 27 points at 11207 French CAC: up 14 points at 4879. Investors are waiting for the Greek crisis to develop, says Tony Cross of Trustnet direct: The political grandstanding continues over the Greek debt talks and although the next key indicator here is likely to be the result of Sunday\u2019s referendum, there\u2019s still the prospect of either side throwing in a firework. The euro is also becalmed - hovering around $1.105. Perhaps London traders are simply overcome with sunstroke and unable to put many bids it. Over in the FT\u2019s letters section, one young Greek citizen has written about her fears for the future: Having made optimistic noises in recent weeks, France\u2019s finance minister sounds increasingly like a glass-half-empty man. Speaking on iTELE, Michel Sapin warned that a No vote could lead to Grexit, as: \u201cYou cannot reach a deal with someone who tells you \u2018No\u2019.\u201d (quote via Reuters) A Yes vote, though, would lead to negotiations resuming immediately. All eurozone finance ministers were united on this point at yesterday\u2019s meeting, Sapin added. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. We\u2019re entering a period of limbo this morning, with both sides now firmly entrenched ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum. In Athens, Alexis Tsipras is pressing on with the vote, insisting it will give him a stronger mandate to agree a third bailout and put Greece on a brighter path. But after yesterday\u2019s TV address, slamming the \u201cextremist conservative forces\u201d in Europe who have tried to undermine him, the rest of Europe hunkering down until Sunday. Last night, euro finance ministers refused to even discuss a third bailout until Sunday\u2019s polls are closed, the ballot boxes emptied, and a result declared. And maybe not even then, if the No side win. As Ian Traynor explained last night: The trenchant criticism of Tsipras from Berlin reinforced the view that the German government might refuse to negotiate with the leftwing Syriza administration on any new rescue package after Sunday\u2019s referendum in Greece \u2013 which Berlin insists is a vote on whether to stay in the euro. Writing in our comment section today, Seamus Milne argues that Berlin and Brussels are determined to achieve \u201cregime change\u201d in Athens: There\u2019s no suggestion of genuine compromise. The aim is apparently to humiliate Tsipras and his government in preparation for its early replacement with a more pliable administration. We know from the IMF documents prepared for last week\u2019s \u201cfinal proposals\u201d and reported in the Guardian that the creditors were fully aware they meant unsustainable levels of debt and self-defeating austerity for Greece until at least 2030, even on the most fancifully optimistic scenario.... Wolfgang Munchau of Euro Intelligence sums it up: So now we wait....Three days of uncertainty lie ahead, with Greece\u2019s economy continuing to bleed from the imposition of capital controls. Last night, the European Central Bank maintained the cap on Greek emergency funding, meaning the banks won\u2019t open before the referendum either. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The agency said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Greek banking system\u2019s liquidity and solvency positions are very weak and some banks may be nearing a point where resolution [intervention to manage the failure of a firm in an orderly fashion] becomes a real possibility. The ECB is responsible for supervising and authorising the four major Greek banks, and the Bank of Greece is resolution authority for the others.</p> <p>Resolution of Greek banks, if required, is unlikely to be straightforward. We believe it would be politically unacceptable to impose losses on Greek creditors and that efforts would be made to find a solution which avoids this but still complies with EU legislation. Existing bank resolution laws in Greece are relatively mature, sharing many similarities with the EU\u2019s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, although they exclude explicit bail-in of senior unsecured creditors.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>And it concludes on a grim note:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>A swift lifting of capital controls is highly unlikely even if there is successful resumption of negotiations with the ECB, IMF and European Commission.
