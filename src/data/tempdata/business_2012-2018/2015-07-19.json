      "bodyText": "House prices are rising rapidly in the north east of England and falling fast in Kensington and Chelsea, according to property website Rightmove, in a remarkable reversal of the trend over the past decade. In the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the average asking price for a property fell by more than \u00a3178,000 to \u00a32.29m during July, a decline of 7.2%. But in the north-east, prices rose by 2.1% over the month, to \u00a3147,251. The region recorded the biggest rise in asking prices of any part of the UK. Meanwhile, the south-east, the south-west and West Midlands all recorded price falls in July, said Rightmove, although its monthly regional figures are viewed as volatile. On an annual basis, asking prices in London notched up the highest gain, rising 7.8% over the year, with Wales recording the biggest fall, down 1.7%. But the overall London figure disguises vastly different results from various boroughs. Areas of the capital seen as unpopular in the past, such as Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Hillingdon and Merton, recorded gains of up to 15% over the year, while prices stagnated in high-price districts such as Islington, Fulham and Richmond. The average asking price in England and Wales inched ahead slightly during July, hitting a record of \u00a3294,542, although this was up only 0.1% on the month before. In figures that echo a report earlier this month by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), Rightmove said there was a sharp drop in the number of homes up for sale. \u201cThe number of properties coming to market is running at a weekly run-rate 10.6% below the same period in 2014. The biggest drop-off in fresh supply is in the typical first-time buyer sector with two bedrooms or fewer. The shortage of suitable property for sale highlights the need for an urgent and marked increase in the overall housing stock to help keep pace with the growth in household formation.\u201d Rightmove said there is a growing battle between first-time buyers and buy-to-let investors over the dwindling supply of two-bed flats and homes. Trevor Binch of Coventry estate agents Merrick Binch said: \u201cWe\u2019re finding that any properties on the market with us at under \u00a3150,000 \u2013 so your typical two-beds or some three bed terraced \u2013 are selling immediately. There are a lot of investors snapping up these types of properties, and this, coupled with the fact that a lot of sellers aren\u2019t coming to market, is making the supply shortage worse. While there are some new developments being built in Coventry, there just isn\u2019t enough to satisfy the demand, especially at the lower end of the market.\u201d In London, the battle between owner-occupiers and landlords is over properties in the \u00a3400,000-\u00a3700,000 price range. Donald Collins of Go View London in Ealing, said: \u201cFor properties we have on between \u00a3400,000 to \u00a3700,000, half of the interest comes from residential buyers and half from investors. The fact that investors have a long-term focus of building their portfolio, and in many cases handing it down to their kids, means that these kinds of properties in the right locations won\u2019t come back round on the market for about 15-20 years.\u201d Earlier this month, RICS reported that the number of homes listed for sale was at its lowest level since records began in 1978, warning that the lack of stock was self-perpetuating as people were put off selling because there was little choice of homes to move to.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of UK food suppliers and farmers struggling to stay afloat has leapt more than 50% in 12 months, as a bitter supermarket price war continues to take its toll. The industry has never been tougher for Britain\u2019s smallest suppliers, said the study from insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor, after its research found 1,622 growers and suppliers in \u201csignificant\u201d financial distress in the three months to the end of June \u2013 up from 1,052 at the same time last year. The researchers said there was a \u201cnew savage landscape\u201d in food retailing and suppliers were bearing the brunt of the big supermarkets\u2019 drastic turnaround plans, aimed at clawing back market share from discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. Almost 90% of the struggling food companies were small and medium-sized businesses, the researchers found, and it is feared some could fall into administration. Significant problems are defined as where a business is facing legal claims for unpaid bills or has suffered a \u201csustained or marked deterioration\u201d in its financial health \u2013 for example in its levels of working capital. Begbies Traynor claimed the outlook was even bleaker and small food suppliers had to face the harsh reality that \u201cprice slashing is not just a short-term pain but something that\u2019s here to stay\u201d. All of the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have struggled with falling sales as shoppers\u2019 habits change, with many people ditching the traditional big weekly shop in favour of several visits to smaller local shops and discounters. Morrisons has clawed back small rises in sales in the past two months but it comes against a background of consistent falls since the beginning of last year. In April, Tesco reported a record \u00a36.4bn loss, though the retailer claimed it was on the road to recovery. The following month, Asda revealed its worst sales figures since the 1990s, while in June, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed its sixth quarter of falling sales. Even upmarket Waitrose has been feeling the pain; it recently started giving loyalty card shoppers money off their favourite items, and indicated it would split the bill for this scheme with suppliers that had signed up. The price wars have kept grocery prices falling constantly since last autumn, bringing prices down by 1.7% in a year, retail researchers Kantar Worldpanel said last month. The pressure on suppliers comes despite supermarkets facing growing scrutiny from Britain\u2019s grocery industry watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), which launched its first formal investigation into a supermarket in February, with an inquiry into allegations that Tesco delayed payments to suppliers and unfairly handled payments for shelf promotions. More recently, as the Guardian revealed last week, the watchdog has asked Morrisons to explain why it is seeking unscheduled payments from suppliers. Begbies Traynor appeared to blame aggressive price-cutting and delays in payments to suppliers for much of the misery being endured by firms in this sector. Julie Palmer, a partner and retail expert at the firm, said: \u201cThe supermarkets have managed to successfully rebase their own models by reducing product ranges, moving away from bulk-buy offers and squeezing supplier margins still further, while failing to clean up their act on late payments, taking more than a month longer than agreed terms to settle debts with suppliers.\u201d She added: \u201cSome are even looking into launching their own food manufacturing facilities to give them even tighter control over costs and the ability to offer still more aggressive pricing \u2013 signalling yet another nightmare scenario on the horizon for the UK food supply chain.\u201d The GCA now has the power to fine supermarkets up to 1% of their turnover if they are found to have breached the groceries code but Palmer claimed this may be of limited use because a recent study found that almost one in five suppliers to the 10 biggest retailers were reluctant to raise any issues with the regulator \u201cfor fear of retribution from their largest source of income\u201d. However, there has been some good news for suppliers; last week Aldi became the first retailer in the UK to sign up to a \u201cfruit and veg pledge\u201d drawn up by the National Farmers Union, which aims to improve long-term relationships with British growers and suppliers, improving their profitability.",

    "webTitle": "Banks face 'uphill battle' to ringfence high street operations, expert warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Major banks could struggle to ringfence their high street operations from their riskier investment banking arms by the deadline of January 2019 because of the complexities involved in dividing up their businesses, an expert on the banking sector has warned. The ringfencing rules, devised by a commission chaired by Sir John Vickers, are being introduced at the same time that banks need to make plans for resolution and recovery \u2013 so-called living wills \u2013 should they go bust. Bill Michael, head of financial services at auditors KPMG, said that despite the work that was already under way, the deadline may be tight for some banks required to make the structural changes. \u201cThe task is so enormous that some of these banks face an uphill battle to be fully compliant,\u201d said Michael. Complying with the changes is \u201cgoing to take years\u201d, he added. \u201cFor some of the very large complex banks preparing for recovery and resolution and the ringfence, they are going to be pushing against [the deadline],\u201d Michael said. All the major banks submitted their ringfencing plans to the Bank of England at the start of the year although more details are still to be released by the regulator about the amount of capital a ringfenced bank should hold. A consultation on the fine detail is due to be released after the summer and it was reported on Sunday that the Treasury was prepared to water down some aspects of the ringfencing rules. Asked about the rules, the Treasury said: \u201cThese are part of the biggest reforms to Britain\u2019s banks in a generation and will make the UK banking system stronger and safer so that it can support the economy, help businesses and serve customers.\u201d George Osborne is said to be taking a new approach to dealing with banks after the 2008 crisis. He reduced the bank levy in his budget earlier this month and did not renew the contract of the combative boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, Martin Wheatley. Some banks have been more forthcoming about their plans for ringfencing than others. HSBC is looking for a new name for its high street bank, prompting speculation it is likely to revert to the Midland brand it ditched more than 15 years ago. John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays who is currently running the bank after the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was ousted, has raised the possibility of buying a bank to obtain a new licence from the Bank of England. McFarlane\u2019s predecessor as chairman, Sir David Walker, waded into the debate after leaving the bank, urging the government to rethink the plans, and warning they were costly to implement. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland has given few clues about its plans while Lloyds Banking Group, which is just under 15% taxpayer owned, expects most of its operations to fall inside the ringfence. Its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has told rivals to stop complaining and press ahead with implementing the rules. Customer deposits must be held inside the ringfence but operations such as derivatives and trade with non-EU counterparts outside. This has prompted questions about how the non-ringfenced operation can be funded by outside investors because it may not be able to attract a high enough credit rating. Michael said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal view but there are huge challenges to implementing the ringfence. The big one is the financial engineering of being able to establish a non-ringfenced bank. Everyone is saying look at the ringfenced bank but the problem for the UK banks is they aren\u2019t banks that conduct just ringfenced activities. The challenge for me is about creating a sustainable group.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Major banks could struggle to ringfence their high street operations from their riskier investment banking arms by the deadline of January 2019 because of the complexities involved in dividing up their businesses, an expert on the banking sector has warned.<br></p> <p>The ringfencing rules, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019\">devised by a commission chaired by Sir John Vickers</a>, are being introduced at the same time that banks need to make plans for resolution and recovery \u2013 so-called living wills \u2013 should they go bust.<br></p> <p>Bill Michael, head of financial services at auditors KPMG, said that despite the work that was already under way, the deadline may be tight for some banks required to make the structural changes.</p> <p>\u201cThe task is so enormous that some of these banks face an uphill battle to be fully compliant,\u201d said Michael. Complying with the changes is \u201cgoing to take years\u201d, he added.</p> <p>\u201cFor some of the very large complex banks preparing for recovery and resolution and the ringfence, they are going to be pushing against [the deadline],\u201d Michael said.</p> <p>All the major banks submitted their ringfencing plans to the Bank of England at the start of the year although more details are still to be released by the regulator about the amount of capital a ringfenced bank should hold.</p> <p>A consultation on the fine detail is due to be released after the summer and it was reported on Sunday that the Treasury was prepared to water down some aspects of the ringfencing rules.</p> <p>Asked about the rules, the Treasury said: \u201cThese are part of the biggest reforms to Britain\u2019s banks in a generation and will make the UK banking system stronger and safer so that it can support the economy, help businesses and serve customers.\u201d</p> <p>George Osborne is said to be taking a new approach to dealing with banks after the 2008 crisis. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy\">reduced the bank levy in his budge</a>t earlier this month and did not renew the contract of the combative boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, Martin Wheatley.</p> <p> Some banks have been more forthcoming about their plans for ringfencing than others. HSBC is looking for a new name for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/09/hsbc-cuts-25000-jobs-globally\">its high street bank</a>, prompting speculation it is likely to revert to the Midland brand it ditched more than 15 years ago. </p> <p>John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays who is currently running the bank after the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was ousted, has raised the possibility of buying a bank to obtain a new licence from the Bank of England. McFarlane\u2019s predecessor as chairman, Sir David Walker, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jun/03/one-way-or-another-a-greek-debt-write-down-will-happen\">waded into the debate</a> after leaving the bank, urging the government to rethink the plans, and warning they were costly to implement.</p> <p>Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland has given few clues about its plans while Lloyds Banking Group, which is just under 15% taxpayer owned, expects most of its operations to fall inside the ringfence. Its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has told rivals to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/18/lloyds-chief-will-urge-banks-stop-complaining-about-regulations\">stop complaining</a> and press ahead with implementing the rules. </p> <p>Customer deposits must be held inside the ringfence but operations such as derivatives and trade with non-EU counterparts outside. This has prompted questions about how the non-ringfenced operation can be funded by outside investors because it may not be able to attract a high enough credit rating. </p> <p>Michael said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal view but there are huge challenges to implementing the ringfence. The big one is the financial engineering of being able to establish a non-ringfenced bank. Everyone is saying look at the ringfenced bank but the problem for the UK banks is they aren\u2019t banks that conduct just ringfenced activities. The challenge for me is about creating a sustainable group.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "By the time most of us are five years old, we\u2019re walking, talking and learning new skills at a rapid clip. In other words, we\u2019re leading a vigorous and independent existence. The Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \u2013 a financial reform package devised in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and popularly known as Dodd-Frank, after its sponsors \u2013 turns five early this week. It is far from being ready to stand on its own two feet. The goal of Dodd-Frank was the prevention of a recurrence of the crisis, making the financial system bulletproof through the creation of new rules, regulations and organizations. Despite some notable successes and much-needed changes, even the most favorably inclined observer would have to acknowledge that Dodd-Frank hasn\u2019t done a terribly impressive job. And the problem is that the further we move from the events that caused the crisis, the less urgency there is to push forward with those parts of the package that haven\u2019t yet been implemented, fix the gaps that remain or fight those who would overturn Dodd-Frank altogether. But hey, it is a celebration, so let\u2019s start with the good stuff. First of all, Dodd-Frank sent a signal: the years of deregulation that had begun in the Reagan era were finally at an end. The financial crisis had made it clear that less oversight was not always a \u201cgood\u201d. In the absence of the industry\u2019s ability to regulate its own behavior, something would have to change. Whether or not the specific measures contained in Dodd-Frank were always the best available is another matter \u2013 what is clear is that Dodd-Frank sent notice to banks and other financial institutions that they couldn\u2019t continue with as little scrutiny and oversight as they had in the past. Dodd-Frank also gave regulators new tools to deal with big banks, including the ability to shut down or seize a bank or other institution deemed to be \u201csystemically important\u201d. Big banks have to turn in \u201cliving wills\u201d to regulators, and submit to stress tests administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. There are new rules for swaps trading (an important kind of derivatives trading), and new efforts to strengthen the Financial Stability Board, which helps coordinate global efforts to pre-emptively address future sources of risk in the markets. None of these are failsafe measures, and clearly they haven\u2019t stopped banks like JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America from reaching even more gargantuan dimensions. But they have helped to ensure that those institutions have much more capital on their books should they run into trouble. Sadly, it is what Dodd-Frank hasn\u2019t done, or what it could have done, or even what no regulation could ever possibly do, that may end up being the act\u2019s single largest legacy. Certainly, I\u2019d be willing to bet these are the issues that dominate the headlines by the time its 10th anniversary rolls around. First, there is the fact that Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t even touch the major proximate source of the crisis: housing finance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate in much the way they did before the crisis struck. Although, true, part of Dodd-Frank involved the creation of the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau \u2013 a one-stop shop to protect consumers from being sold products such as the subprime mortgages that were chiefly responsible for the crisis. Concentrating all of that consumer protection effort in one location makes it more likely that it will end up working effectively. Then we have to factor into consideration the reality that some elements of Dodd-Frank still haven\u2019t become law. The famous Volcker Rule \u2013 named after the former head of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, who first proposed that banks whose deposits are insured by the federal government shouldn\u2019t be allowed to trade and speculate using that capital for their own accounts \u2013 finally becomes law this month. But efforts to rein in excessive bank bonuses and other incentive compensation may still be years away from implementation. The law of unintended consequences comes into effect, too. All too often, when we try to fix one problem, we create a host of new ones. For instance, in curbing risk-taking by banks, we cut off a source of profits. This may make them more reluctant to risk capital in other areas. Meanwhile, the banks are pushing back on Dodd-Frank. With deep pockets and large retinues of costly lawyers \u2013 and eager allies in Congress (whether aligned with them out of conviction or because the banks are big campaign donors) \u2013 bankers like JP Morgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon make no secret of their loathing for Dodd-Frank and their hope to see it end up in the dustbin of history. There is no role for regulators or government in policing Wall Street, they argue. Wall Street will do that for itself. If only Wall Street would or could. In fact, the biggest problem with Dodd-Frank is what it can\u2019t do: it can\u2019t change Wall Street\u2019s culture, one in which permissiveness, cheating and abusive behavior is too often the norm. Wall Street scandals and crises didn\u2019t end with the events of 2008, or the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Since then we\u2019ve witnessed the Libor price-rigging scandal, that cost many banks billions of dollars of fines, and the so-called \u201cLondon Whale\u201d mess at JP Morgan, which lost the bank $6.2bn on risky derivatives trades. Dodd-Frank had good intentions. I\u2019ll line up to wish it a happy birthday, and even toast it in champagne. But I won\u2019t make the mistake of seeing it as a panacea for what\u2019s really necessary: a radical reshaping of Wall Street culture.",

    "webTitle": "The euro \u2013 the 'New' Coke of currencies?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The date 23 April 1985 was a momentous day in the life of the Coca-Cola corporation. For years, the company had been planning a new drink to see off the challenge from Pepsi. There was no expense spared for Project Kansas. \u201cNew\u201d Coke (as it was dubbed) bombed. The company responded with alacrity. It didn\u2019t say consumers were wrong. It didn\u2019t say that given time New Coke would be a success. It didn\u2019t plough on simply because it had invested heavily in Project Kansas. Instead, it recognised that there was only one option: to go back to the traditional formula. This returned to the shelves on 11 July 1985, within three months of \u201cNew\u201d Coke\u2019s launch. There is a lesson here for both businesses and policymakers \u2013 and European policymakers in particular. Sixteen years after its launch, it should be clear even to its most die-hard supporters that the euro is New Coke. European politicians took a formula that was working and messed around with it. They changed the ingredients that made the European Union a success, thinking it would be an improvement. Coca-Cola thought New Coke would see off the challenge from Pepsi. Europe thought the euro would see off the challenge from the US. Both were wrong. The only difference is that Coke quickly saw the writing on the wall, and that Europe still hasn\u2019t. It is not hard to see why the pre-euro European Union was popular. The EU was seen as a symbol of peace and prosperity after a period when the continent had been beset by mass unemployment, poverty, dictatorship and war. Growth rates were spectacularly high in the 1950s and 1960s, a period when Europe caught up rapidly with the US. Britain\u2019s decision to join what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 was mainly due to the feeling that Germany, France and Italy had found the secret of economic success. Other countries felt the same. They believed access to a bigger market would improve their economic prospects. In the last quarter of the 20th century, output per head in Greece, Portugal, Spain and \u2013 most spectacularly \u2013 Ireland, rose more rapidly than it did in core countries such as Germany and France. The gap in incomes per head did not entirely disappear but it certainly narrowed. As such, it was no surprise that countries in eastern Europe wanted to join the EU after the collapse of communism: Europe was associated with democracy and prosperity, a winning combination. Since the birth of the euro, it has been a different story. The crisis in Greece has highlighted the problems that a one-size-fits-all interest rate can cause for countries on the periphery. In the good times, monetary policy is too loose for their needs, leading to asset bubbles, inflationary pressure and the loss of competitiveness. In the bad times, there are no shock absorbers other than wage cuts and austerity. Devaluation of the currency is not possible and there is no system to tio transfer resources from rich to poor parts of the union. Without a common social security system, the result is higher unemployment, rising poverty and political disaffection. What\u2019s less remarked on is that the single currency has not been wonderful for ordinary workers in core Europe either. That\u2019s not just true of Italy, a founder member, where living standards are no higher now than they were in the late 1990s, but also of Germany. To be sure, German industry has prospered in the past decade and a half. Competitiveness has improved and this has made top-quality German manufactured goods more competitive on global markets. Exports have boomed, as has Germany\u2019s trade surplus. All this, as Dhaval Joshi of BCA research has noted, has been possible because the wages of German workers have been squeezed. Amazingly, over the entire history of the single currency, nominal wages in Germany \u2013 not adjusted for inflation \u2013 have increased by less than they have in Greece, despite the savage wage cuts in the latter since 2010. Joshi notes that the structural reforms to the German economy in the early 2000s were carried out ostensibly to boost productivity, but that in reality it rose no more quickly than it has in France, where no such reforms have been undertaken. As a result, the profits German companies have been making abroad have been due to the pay cuts swallowed by workers at home. It is little wonder, Joshi says, that public opinion in Germany is hostile to the idea of writing off Greece\u2019s debts. This sort of problem would not have occurred in the days before the single currency. Germany could not have built up its huge trade surpluses under a less rigid exchange rate system, because the mark would have appreciated, making exports more expensive and imports less expensive. There was no need for the German taxpayer to write cheques to the Greek government; all they needed to do was exploit the weakening drachma and head for the Greek islands. The unhappiness felt by the Germans matters. Those who, despite all the evidence to the contrary, cling to the belief that the single currency is a progressive project, say that they always knew that monetary union had design flaws, and that the only way to make it work was to buttress the single currency with a common fiscal policy, a European-wide system of tax and spending akin to that in the US or the UK. This certainly would be one way out of the current mess, but the chances of Germany \u2013 or indeed any of the like-minded countries in northern Europe \u2013 signing up to such an arrangement is diminishing by the day. Nor would countries such as France or Italy submit to the conditions Germany would demand. European solidarity has been badly damaged by five years of continual crisis. Another argument is that Europe is like a bicycle: it will fall over unless there is enough momentum to carry it forward. Companies don\u2019t see it this way.

There was no expense spared for Project Kansas. </p> <p>\u201cNew\u201d Coke (as it was dubbed) bombed. The company responded with alacrity. It didn\u2019t say consumers were wrong. It didn\u2019t say that given time New Coke would be a success. It didn\u2019t plough on simply because it had invested heavily in Project Kansas. Instead, it recognised that there was only one option: to go back to the traditional formula. This returned to the shelves on 11 July 1985, within three months of \u201cNew\u201d Coke\u2019s launch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/18/greece-eu-debt-deal-what-lies-ahead\">Now a deal has been done, what lies ahead for the Greek economy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a lesson here for both businesses and policymakers \u2013 and European policymakers in particular. Sixteen years after its launch, it should be clear even to its most die-hard supporters that the euro is New Coke. </p> <p>European politicians took a formula that was working and messed around with it. They changed the ingredients that made the European Union a success, thinking it would be an improvement. Coca-Cola thought New Coke would see off the challenge from Pepsi. Europe thought the euro would see off the challenge from the US. Both were wrong. The only difference is that Coke quickly saw the writing on the wall, and that Europe still hasn\u2019t.<br></p> <p>It is not hard to see why the pre-euro European Union was popular. The EU was seen as a symbol of peace and prosperity after a period when the continent had been beset by mass unemployment, poverty, dictatorship and war. Growth rates were spectacularly high in the 1950s and 1960s, a period when Europe caught up rapidly with the US. Britain\u2019s decision to join what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 was mainly due to the feeling that Germany, France and Italy had found the secret of economic success.</p> <p>Other countries felt the same. They believed access to a bigger market would improve their economic prospects. In the last quarter of the 20th century, output per head in Greece, Portugal, Spain and \u2013 most spectacularly \u2013 Ireland, rose more rapidly than it did in core countries such as Germany and France. The gap in incomes per head did not entirely disappear but it certainly narrowed. As such, it was no surprise that countries in eastern Europe wanted to join the EU after the collapse of communism: Europe was associated with democracy and prosperity, a winning combination.</p> <p>Since the birth of the euro, it has been a different story. The crisis in Greece has highlighted the problems that a one-size-fits-all interest rate can cause for countries on the periphery. In the good times, monetary policy is too loose for their needs, leading to asset bubbles, inflationary pressure and the loss of competitiveness.</p> <p>In the bad times, there are no shock absorbers other than wage cuts and austerity. Devaluation of the currency is not possible and there is no system to tio transfer resources from rich to poor parts of the union. Without a common social security system, the result is higher unemployment, rising poverty and political disaffection.</p> <p>What\u2019s less remarked on is that the single currency has not been wonderful for ordinary workers in core Europe either. That\u2019s not just true of Italy, a founder member, where living standards are no higher now than they were in the late 1990s, but also of Germany.</p> <p>To be sure, German industry has prospered in the past decade and a half. Competitiveness has improved and this has made top-quality German manufactured goods more competitive on global markets. Exports have boomed, as has Germany\u2019s trade surplus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/german_greek_wages/giv-21277tTQKJPTBmmpl/\" data-alt=\"German v Greek wages\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/german_greek_wages/giv-21277tTQKJPTBmmpl/\">German v Greek wages</a> </figure>  <p>All this, as Dhaval Joshi of BCA research has noted, has been possible because the wages of German workers have been squeezed. Amazingly, over the entire history of the single currency, nominal wages in Germany \u2013 not adjusted for inflation \u2013 have increased by less than they have in Greece, despite the savage wage cuts in the latter since 2010.</p> <p>Joshi notes that the structural reforms to the German economy in the early 2000s were carried out ostensibly to boost productivity, but that in reality it rose no more quickly than it has in France, where no such reforms have been undertaken. As a result, the profits German companies have been making abroad have been due to the pay cuts swallowed by workers at home. It is little wonder, Joshi says, that public opinion in Germany is hostile to the idea of writing off Greece\u2019s debts.</p> <p>This sort of problem would not have occurred in the days before the single currency. Germany could not have built up its huge trade surpluses under a less rigid exchange rate system, because the mark would have appreciated, making exports more expensive and imports less expensive. There was no need for the German taxpayer to write cheques to the Greek government; all they needed to do was exploit the weakening drachma and head for the Greek islands.</p> <p>The unhappiness felt by the Germans matters. Those who, despite all the evidence to the contrary, cling to the belief that the single currency is a progressive project, say that they always knew that monetary union had design flaws, and that the only way to make it work was to buttress the single currency with a common fiscal policy, a European-wide system of tax and spending akin to that in the US or the UK.</p> <p>This certainly would be one way out of the current mess, but the chances of Germany \u2013 or indeed any of the like-minded countries in northern Europe \u2013 signing up to such an arrangement is diminishing by the day. Nor would countries such as France or Italy submit to the conditions Germany would demand. European solidarity has been badly damaged by five years of continual crisis.</p> <p>Another argument is that Europe is like a bicycle: it will fall over unless there is enough momentum to carry it forward. Companies don\u2019t see it this way. If a product is failing, they change course before the business goes bust. That\u2019s why Coca-Cola acted as it did in 1985.</p> <p>It is not just companies that operate by trial and error. Margaret Thatcher was as big a zealot for the poll tax as Jacques Delors was, at around the same time, for the euro. There were riots on the streets of Britain and within a year of the poll tax being introduced in England and Wales in 1990, John Major announced its demise.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the way progress occurs.

Whether he was the \u201cringmaster\u201d of a plot driven by greed, as the prosecution argued, or taking part in what he claimed was an industrywide activity, the trial has highlighted once again the apparent disregard for rules and ethics in some parts of the City.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Cameron must work hard to engineer pay equality", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is more than 40 years since the Equal Pay Act and still employers are only inching forward. In 2010 the coalition government put in place legislation allowing ministers to demand that employers conduct pay audits, and then promptly left it on the shelf. Now David Cameron has dusted off the section of the coalition\u2019s Equality Act related to pay audits and said he wants to go ahead. Yet, fearful of the potential impact on businesses, he has asked for a period of consultation over how audits should be handled \u2013 bringing more delay. However, if the delay persuades him that a simple aggregate figure of total pay for men and women in an organisation is too simplistic, the wait will be worthwhile. That\u2019s because unequal pay is a thorny subject and demands that some decent resources be thrown at identifying winners and losers. A recent report by recruiters Michael Page found that, among a highly paid group of financial managers, male earnings were almost \u00a345,000 a year more than women. Similarly, the annual salary of female health professionals is less than half the salary of their male colleagues. This and many other studies have shown that women receive lower pay. The question is why? According to the Office for National Statistics, women earn 0.2% more than men in their 30s, only to fall behind in their 40s when they earn 14% less in hourly wages. It is not hard to see how this happens. Anyone who takes time out to look after children is going to see their income fall behind those who don\u2019t. And mostly those who take on the burden of childcare are women. But this fact puts Cameron in direct conflict with the big employers\u2019 organisations like the Confederation of British Industry, which warns that publishing the gap in pay could be \u201cmisleading\u201d. It says it prefers a voluntary approach, and wants the government to focus on the way \u201cstereotypes\u201d deter women from pursuing higher-earning careers \u2013 rather than take a hard look at the lack of childcare support and anything else that might add to their costs. Of course there is stereotyping in the workplace, but family-friendly policies must be part of the equation. And stereotyping is not just about who gets promoted and who doesn\u2019t, which is the focus of the Michael Page study: it stretches to the attitudes of entire industries \u2013 and, importantly for the gender pay gap, industries that pay better than average. Look at the gender balance in the 2.3-million-strong engineering profession, which can only lay claim to a 6.7% rate of female participation. (In mechanical engineering the problem is even deeper: of its chartered members, only 1% are women.) The professions are rife with outmoded attitudes that persuade women they are not wanted, from male locker-room humour to a time-serving attitude to work. Outmoded management practices born in the era of empire that rely on people barking orders are also a big turn-off (although admittedly not just for women). Cameron made a big splash with his commitment to raise the pay of women to equality with men. He said it was an issue whose time had come. He needs to honour that commitment. (Perhaps putting behind him the days when he was tempted to answer a woman who dared question him with \u201ccalm down, dear\u201d would be one way to start.) But it is not difficult to see ways in which he could demonstrate his goodwill. Finding a way to audit who in any organisation does a similar job, with virtually the same responsibilities, should not be beyond the wit of the many consultancies that work in employment. Cameron should insist they be given the time and money to provide their assessments. Britain needs a pay rise, Cameron has said. It shouldn\u2019t just be the men who get one. Zero-hours contracts still add up to a lot of injustice Sports Direct\u2019s sprawling mega-warehouse in Shirebrook, north-east Derbyshire, sits on the site of the town\u2019s old colliery, closed by Michael Heseltine in 1993. It is Labour heartland, a constituency comfortably held by Dennis Skinner MP since 1970. Regularly helicoptered into the site, however, is the man who keeps this business at the vanguard of 21st century Britain\u2019s flexible labour , heralded by the Conservative party for keeping unemployment down during recent yearsmarket. Mike Ashley, whose personal fortune is estimated at \u00a33.5bn, has made Shirebrook the engine of his chain of 660 sportswear stores. Last week, the company said it was sharing its success with the workforce: shares worth \u00a3155m are to be handed out to about 2,000 of Sports Direct\u2019s top managers and staff. At Shirebrook that could be about 300 lucky workers. That is because the rest of the 3,000-strong workforce are thought to be agency staff on zero-hours contracts. Many are on the minimum wage, having travelled from Poland for work. They won\u2019t get the bonus. For these staff, incentives are about hoping for sufficient hours of employment to pay the bills. In the runup to the election, Conservative politicians were happy to peddle the implausible line that the flexibility afforded by zero-hours contracts is welcomed by many staff, such as students and working parents. By contrast, Ed Miliband took a stand. He declared: \u201cThese Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.\u201d This appeared to cut no ice with the electorate, who judged him harshly. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in London now think the debate is over. \u201cConcern over the use of zero-hours contracts has subsided,\u201d they told investors in Sports Direct last week. Whether or not a future Labour leader makes this a campaigning matter, the inequities of excessive and aggressive low-wage employment are now so acute they cannot be ignored. There is only so much you can squeeze from insecure wage-hungry staff before something dramatic happens. This is a scandal that is not going away. Tory touchiness shows Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, provided one of the few clear, neutral voices in the runup to May\u2019s general election. But at the newly convened treasury select committee last week it became clear that the IFS has begun to get under the Tories\u2019 skin. Chairman Andrew Tyrie and his Conservative colleagues criticised the IFS for failing to include George Osborne\u2019s minimum-wage rise in its usual post-budget distributional chart, which showed that the impact of the Treasury\u2019s \u00a312bn in welfare cuts will fall most heavily at the lower end of the income scale. Johnson explained that the IFS didn\u2019t have the capacity to model it at such short notice; Tyrie demanded an answer by Monday, because 80% of the IFS\u2019s funding comes from the government, and it exists \u201cto support committees like this\u201d. The IFS does receive support from taxpayers through the Economic and Social Research Council, but so do academics up and down the country, who would be horrified at the idea that it made them beholden to politicians\u2019 demands. Johnson is a national treasure \u2013 it ill behoves Tyrie to try to push him around.",

      "body": "<p>It is more than 40 years since the Equal Pay Act and still employers are only inching forward. In 2010 the coalition government put in place legislation allowing ministers to demand that employers conduct pay audits, and then promptly left it on the shelf.</p> <p>Now David Cameron has dusted off the section of the coalition\u2019s Equality Act related to pay audits and said he wants to go ahead. Yet, fearful of the potential impact on businesses, he has asked for a period of consultation over how audits should be handled \u2013 bringing more delay.</p> <p>However, if the delay persuades him that a simple aggregate figure of total pay for men and women in an organisation is too simplistic, the wait will be worthwhile. That\u2019s because unequal pay is a thorny subject and demands that some decent resources be thrown at identifying winners and losers.</p> <p>A recent report by recruiters Michael Page found that, among a highly paid group of financial managers, male earnings were almost \u00a345,000 a year more than women. Similarly, the annual salary of female health professionals is less than half the salary of their male colleagues.</p> <p>This and many other studies have shown that women receive lower pay. The question is why?</p> <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, women earn 0.2% more than men in their 30s, only to fall behind in their 40s when they earn 14% less in hourly wages.</p> <p>It is not hard to see how this happens. Anyone who takes time out to look after children is going to see their income fall behind those who don\u2019t. And mostly those who take on the burden of childcare are women.</p> <p>But this fact puts Cameron in direct conflict with the big employers\u2019 organisations like the Confederation of British Industry, which warns that publishing the gap in pay could be \u201cmisleading\u201d. It says it prefers a voluntary approach, and wants the government to focus on the way \u201cstereotypes\u201d deter women from pursuing higher-earning careers \u2013 rather than take a hard look at the lack of childcare support and anything else that might add to their costs.</p> <p>Of course there is stereotyping in the workplace, but family-friendly policies must be part of the equation. And stereotyping is not just about who gets promoted and who doesn\u2019t, which is the focus of the Michael Page study: it stretches to the attitudes of entire industries \u2013 and, importantly for the gender pay gap, industries that pay better than average.</p> <p>Look at the gender balance in the 2.3-million-strong engineering profession, which can only lay claim to a 6.7% rate of female participation. (In mechanical engineering the problem is even deeper: of its chartered members, only 1% are women.) The professions are rife with outmoded attitudes that persuade women they are not wanted, from male locker-room humour to a time-serving attitude to work. Outmoded management practices born in the era of empire that rely on people barking orders are also a big turn-off (although admittedly not just for women).</p> <p>Cameron made a big splash with his commitment to raise the pay of women to equality with men. He said it was an issue whose time had come. He needs to honour that commitment. (Perhaps putting behind him the days when he was tempted to answer a woman who dared question him with \u201ccalm down, dear\u201d would be one way to start.) But it is not difficult to see ways in which he could demonstrate his goodwill.</p> <p>Finding a way to audit who in any organisation does a similar job, with virtually the same responsibilities, should not be beyond the wit of the many consultancies that work in employment. Cameron should insist they be given the time and money to provide their assessments. Britain needs a pay rise, Cameron has said. It shouldn\u2019t just be the men who get one.</p> <h2>Zero-hours contracts still add up to a lot of injustice</h2> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s sprawling mega-warehouse in Shirebrook, north-east Derbyshire, sits on the site of the town\u2019s old colliery, closed by Michael Heseltine in 1993. It is Labour heartland, a constituency comfortably held by Dennis Skinner MP since 1970.</p> <p>Regularly helicoptered into the site, however, is the man who keeps this business at the vanguard of 21st century Britain\u2019s flexible labour , heralded by the Conservative party for keeping unemployment down during recent yearsmarket. Mike Ashley, whose personal fortune is estimated at \u00a33.5bn, has made Shirebrook the engine of his chain of 660 sportswear stores.</p> <p>Last week, the company said it was sharing its success with the workforce: shares worth \u00a3155m are to be handed out to about 2,000 of Sports Direct\u2019s top managers and staff. At Shirebrook that could be about 300 lucky workers. That is because the rest of the 3,000-strong workforce are thought to be agency staff on zero-hours contracts. Many are on the minimum wage, having travelled from Poland for work. They won\u2019t get the bonus. For these staff, incentives are about hoping for sufficient hours of employment to pay the bills.</p> <p>In the runup to the election, Conservative politicians were happy to peddle the implausible line that the flexibility afforded by zero-hours contracts is welcomed by many staff, such as students and working parents. By contrast, Ed Miliband took a stand. He declared: \u201cThese Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>This appeared to cut no ice with the electorate, who judged him harshly. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in London now think the debate is over. \u201cConcern over the use of zero-hours contracts has subsided,\u201d they told investors in Sports Direct last week.</p> <p>Whether or not a future Labour leader makes this a campaigning matter, the inequities of excessive and aggressive low-wage employment are now so acute they cannot be ignored. There is only so much you can squeeze from insecure wage-hungry staff before something dramatic happens. This is a scandal that is not going away.</p> <h2>Tory touchiness shows<br></h2> <p>Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, provided one of the few clear, neutral voices in the runup to May\u2019s general election. But at the newly convened treasury select committee last week it became clear that the IFS has begun to get under the Tories\u2019 skin.</p> <p>Chairman Andrew Tyrie and his Conservative colleagues criticised the IFS for failing to include George Osborne\u2019s minimum-wage rise in its usual post-budget distributional chart, which showed that the impact of the Treasury\u2019s \u00a312bn in welfare cuts will fall most heavily at the lower end of the income scale.</p> <p>Johnson explained that the IFS didn\u2019t have the capacity to model it at such short notice; Tyrie demanded an answer by Monday, because 80% of the IFS\u2019s funding comes from the government, and it exists \u201cto support committees like this\u201d.</p> <p>The IFS does receive support from taxpayers through the Economic and Social Research Council, but so do academics up and down the country, who would be horrified at the idea that it made them beholden to politicians\u2019 demands.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Borrowers beware: Mark Carney\u2019s clear message in his speech at Lincoln cathedral last week was that interest rates may have to rise soon \u2013 something anyone who has bought a home or taken out a loan in the past eight years will never have experienced. Yet the other signal that came through \u2013 aside from some chin-stroking on medieval inflation and the Magna Carta \u2013 was that the fragile, lopsided state of the post-crash British economy means the Bank must proceed with great care. The arguments for a rate rise are easy to assemble, and cheerleaders for the hawkish cause, such as ex-monetary policy committee member Andrew Sentance, have been making them for several months. Growth has picked up; wages are finally increasing; business confidence is strong. Moreover, the earlier in the cycle rates start to go up, the argument runs, the more ammunition policymakers will have to respond to any future crisis. And leaving rate \u201clift off\u201d too late might allow inflation to take hold, so that the policy response when it came would have to be more drastic. As David Miles, whose term on the MPC is about to end, put it in a speech last week, \u201cwaiting too long to start on a path back to a more sustainable rate is a bad mistake. What you really need to avoid is sharp rises in interest rates.\u201d Miles, who was previously considered a dove, insisted: \u201cThe time to start normalisation is soon; that is not something to shrink from.\u201d Yet there are several reasons, all of which Carney acknowledged, not to rush towards higher rates. First, as the Bank\u2019s own recent financial stability review pointed out, despite the wrenching adjustment that followed the financial crisis, UK households remain among the most heavily indebted in any major economy. And, as the governor stressed, our predilection for floating-rate mortgages (or our banks\u2019 predilection for selling them to us), means that compared to the US, for example, a larger proportion of borrowers would see an immediate impact on their monthly repayments if base rates increased. Credit card borrowing has also increased rapidly since 2012. Research by the Resolution Foundation last year found that even modest rate rises would see one in four mortgage borrowers forced to spend more than a third of their income on repayments. Second, sterling has strengthened significantly in recent months \u2013 and jumped again on Friday \u2013 both in anticipation of a rate rise, and because the eurozone crisis has been weighing on the value of the single currency. That not only puts the brakes on the export drive George Osborne has repeatedly promised, by making British goods less competitive; it also depresses the price of imported goods, dragging down inflation. Third, the global environment still looks risky. China\u2019s stock-market crash has underlined the uncertainties about its profound economic transformation; a string of heavily indebted emerging economies are bracing themselves for the US rate rise expected later this year; and the eurozone crisis rolls on. Fourth, as Carney stressed, the Conservative government\u2019s next round of deficit reduction means \u201cthe IMF expects the UK to undergo the largest fiscal adjustment of any major advanced economy over the next five years\u201d. Notwithstanding Osborne\u2019s welcome decision to jack up the minimum wage, these cuts will sap economic demand, forcing the Bank to keep monetary policy loose. Indeed, Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University has argued powerfully that it is reckless for the government to press ahead with deficit cuts when the Bank has so little power to offset it with fresh rate cuts. And as for the argument that central bankers should rush to raise rates now, so that they have more scope to lower them later: it\u2019s little more than the Grand Old Duke of York approach to monetary policy \u2013 as other central banks, including Sweden\u2019s, have learned in the wake of the crisis. In Sweden, the Riksbank began raising rates in 2010, believing that the worst of the credit crunch was over, and concerned about rapid increases in household borrowing. By mid-2011, it had pushed up interest rates seven times; but as the krona strengthened sharply and the economy slowed, it was forced into a swift about-turn. Rates were cut from early 2012 and are now lower than during the depths of the crisis. This is not the first time Carney has tried to telegraph an imminent policy tightening. He started his term by persuading his colleagues to embrace the whizzy new approach of \u201cforward guidance\u201d, specifiying the unemployment rate \u2013 7% \u2013 at which the MPC would consider raising rates. When that 7% threshold came and went without sparking the expected recovery in wages, and GDP growth continued to underperform, forward guidance was effectively shelved (and, as ex-Bank economist Tony Yates pointed out last week, its effectiveness as a tool in any future crisis has been blunted). At last summer\u2019s Mansion House speech, the governor suggested the markets might have been underestimating the likelihood that rates were about to rise. They weren\u2019t. This time around, with inflation still at zero, Carney almost seemed to lack the courage of his own convictions. \u201cThe MPC will have to feel its way as it goes,\u201d he said, \u201cmonitoring a wide range of indicators and adjusting the pace and degree of bank rate as it learns about the effects of higher interest rates on the economy.\u201d That\u2019s about as close as a rock star central banker can come to \u201csuck it and see\u201d.",
