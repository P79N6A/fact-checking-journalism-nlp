    "webTitle": "We have to own up on the UK economy \u2013 we are not a big club anymore | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The English football league was founded in 1888, a time when Britain still clung on to its position as the world's industrial powerhouse, and founder members reflected the fact that the economy's centre of gravity was north of a line drawn from the Severn estuary to the Wash. For a football fan, what's striking about the original dozen clubs \u2013 Accrington Stanley [see footnote], Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2013 is that not one of them would be counted as a member of today's elite. Three are midtable in the Premier League, four are battling against relegation and five are plying their trade in the lower divisions. The downwardly mobile state of some of these grand old clubs has been mirrored by the UK's slide down the economic league table. What's more, there are striking parallels between the England team and the national economy: the complacency bred of inventing the game in the first place, the failure to adapt, the many false dawns, the way imported talent has shown up the deficiencies of the domestic workforce and, above all, the belief that with one or two tweaks (step forward Harry Redknapp) all will be well again. If it is hard to put a precise date on the moment when the UK economy peaked, there is no such difficulty picking the zenith of English football: the moment shortly before 5.30 on a Saturday afternoon in July 1966 when Geoff Hurst's shot thumped into the net at Wembley gave England a 4-2 victory over West Germany in the World Cup final. Ever since, it has been a story of profound underachievement as other countries have exposed the limitations of the country that gave the world the beautiful game. At first, only traditional rivals put England in the shade: Germany, Brazil, Argentina. More recently, though, the national team has struggled to cope with the challenge from the game's lesser lights, drawing with Algeria and the United States in the group stages of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before being thrashed 4-1 by the Germans in the first knockout round. There was plenty of soul-searching when the lavishly paid England \"stars\" flew home in humiliation. In the past, excuses for World Cup failure had been that the hot weather sapped the players' strength; that they were not used to games at high altitude; that they had been missing key players; that British coaches were light years behind their continental counterparts; or that they had been robbed by bad luck or by cheating foreigners. None of the familiar get-outs applied to a tournament played in South Africa in winter when a full-strength England was beaten by a demonstrably superior German team. The side was even managed by an Italian, the Football Association having come to the conclusion that if Japanese management could breathe new life into the car industry, Fabio Capello could do the same for 11 men kicking a ball around on a large lawn. He couldn't. Now let's look at the economy. Initially, the challenge came from the United States and Germany, but after the second world war the UK was also eclipsed in terms of growth rates and living standards by France, Italy and the Scandinavian nations. More recently, the threat has come from the bigger emerging economies of India and China. Warning signs of imminent decline have too often been ignored and even when they have been heeded, wrong lessons have been learned. Excuses (poor management, stroppy trade unions, too much or too little Europe, too great an appetite for grandiose projects, a snobbish approach to \"trade\") have been trotted out. All sorts of remedies have been tried in an attempt to bring back the glory days and all, sooner or later, have failed. So let's try a thought experiment. Imagine there was the economic equivalent of an Alex Ferguson, an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or a Redknapp who could be brought in to take control at UK FC. What would he say? Firstly, it would be clear that the economy has been far too dependent for far too long on one or two stars \u2013 the City and the housing market \u2013 that are in decline. Successful economies, like successful football teams, have a strong central core, and are well balanced between manufacturing and services and good at developing talent. This is much harder to achieve than it looks. It is not just a question of spending money nor of assuming that simply clobbering the City will lead to a thriving manufacturing base. As Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform has noted, as a share of its economy Italy's manufacturing sector is as big as Germany's, while France's industrial base is as small as Britain's. Rebalancing the economy is going to involve more than simply depreciating the currency or offering infant industry protection of the sort afforded by the emerging Asian economies, since that assumes there is enough there to protect. As things stand, there isn't. What countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and China understood was that getting macro-policy and industrial policy right was vital but still only half the story. In addition, there was intensive investment in education and training over many decades, which is now reflected in the international league tables produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The latest Programme for International Student Assessment in 2010 showed the UK in 25th place for reading, 28th place for maths and 16th place for science: mid-table and falling. As with football, the reality is that other nations are now a lot more skilful than we are, and there is plenty of work to be done on the training ground. The mantra should be that we have to brain up to build up. But first we have to own up. Perhaps the most important job for a new manager would be to tell the team he has inherited that it is not nearly as good as it thinks it is. Britain has not challenged for the world economy's Premiership title for 100 years, but for most of the past century we have comforted ourselves that we are a big club with a proud tradition, and that with a couple of new signings could once again give the best a run for their money. Recent results suggest otherwise. The recession was brutal and the recovery has been weak. Living standards will not return to their 2003 level until 2016. There are over one million young people unemployed. There are no new sources of growth to replace financial and property speculation. The old industrial heartlands have been decimated. The Treasury is skint. Britain is not an Everton or an Aston Villa, comforting though that thought may be. The table does not lie: we are a Bolton or a Blackburn, holding on to our place in the Premier League by our fingertips. \u2022 This footnote was appended on 16 February 2012. To clarify: some of these clubs were known by different names in the past. The author gave the modern appellation of all of them to avoid confusion.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor of the exchequer has called on his fellow citizens not to be \"anti-business\". In doing so he is indulging in the time-honoured ploy of setting up a man of straw. I know of few people who are anti-business. Unfortunately, this small band includes George Osborne himself, whose deflationary policies have ensured, as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research recently pointed out, that the British economy is recovering more slowly from the 2007-2008 financial crisis than it did in the 1930s in the wake of the 1929-31 Great Depression. This is not good for business, and many good companies are going under as a result of the chancellor's strategy. By contrast, in the US, where the economic stimulus of 2009 was not withdrawn prematurely, there is a genuine recovery, even if it is sluggish by previous standards. No, what people do not like about \"business\" is bad business practices, which make the consumer's life difficult. Just as something went badly wrong with the financial sector and economic policy during the past decade \u2013 banks out of control; policymakers obsessed with inflation targets and ignoring the credit boom \u2013 so there was also an unfortunate development in the attitudes of many companies towards the consumer. The prevailing strategy of such businesses these days is that the consumer should do the work. Amazingly, most people seem to put up with this. They may complain about having to speak to call centres in remote parts of the world, but will happily spend hours ordering goods and services online. If that is what people want, so be it; however, it is not for me. I came across a classic deterioration in service standards on the Gatwick Express last weekend. The operators appeared to have dispensed with the onboard person who would check tickets and issue them if one had rushed onto the train. Last weekend there was confusion all round, especially for tourists. This is a pity. The Gatwick Express used to be one of our better services. I recall the time that David Marsh, now co-chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a monetary thinktank, invited Gerhard Schr\u00f6der to speak in central London before Schr\u00f6der became the German chancellor. The car provided for him took two and a half hours to get from Gatwick to W1, and your correspondent suggested that the Gatwick Express would be a better bet next time. Schr\u00f6der was in town again last week, and chose not to repeat the Gatwick experience, flying to my favourite London destination, namely City Airport. In 1998 he had been sceptical about the far-advanced plans for a single currency, but as chancellor he inherited membership of the eurozone and was loyally supportive. However, addressing the first International Statesmen's dinner in Ironmongers' Hall - where there is no shortage of armour on display \u2013 he pulled no punches: \"There is a risk that the national economies will be more or less strangled by strict austerity measures,\" he warned, adding for good measure that, although president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand of France had wanted to \"enclose\" Germany's economic strength, \"and, hence, our political strength [by setting up the eurozone] \"this was doomed to fail because Germany, as an export nation, profits enormously from the euro\". Just to ram home the point, Schr\u00f6der added that the mistake made by his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, \"was to assume that monetary union would force a political union\". The export contrast is marked: in the first half of last year Germany had a current balance of payments surplus of $88.6bn (\u00a356bn), whereas France had a deficit of $33.5bn. I sometimes wonder whether the eurozone crisis would have happened quite so soon after the currency's inception if it had not been for the wider financial crisis of 2007-08, which undermined confidence in the entire system, with manifest consequences for the eurozone. Opinion about the chances of the eurozone pulling through seems to go up and down like a yo-yo, with many sighs of relief recently about the massive injection of liquidity \u2013 for up to three years \u2013 into the banking system by the European Central Bank, under the new presidency of the widely admired Mario Draghi. There was a distinct echo here of the post-Lehman operation by central banks to avoid a meltdown, and Draghi told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month that his latest operation had \"avoided a major, major credit crunch\". But that merely buys time. The \"fiscal compact\" on which members of the eurozone have agreed is a \"good times\" compact; it is no answer to the current depression. I was recently rather taken aback to hear one of Draghi's fellow Italian officials, who last year strongly criticised the Germans for their obsession with austerity at a time of economic weakness, deliver a paean of praise for the current approach. As my old friend Professor Lord Desai observes: \"Despite all the talk of creating jobs for the young, the euro area offers its people hopeless capitalism for the foreseeable future. The talk may be about growth, but the pact is about zero deficits.\"",

As Indonesia's tough finance minister from 2005 to 2010, and before that as an economic adviser to the Wahid regime that ran Indonesia from 1999 to 2001, she watched her country \u2013 one of the most populous in the world \u2013 struggle to emerge from decades of dictatorship and economic repression. Indonesia was swept up in the last major financial crisis, in the late 1990s, when international markets fell out of love with the \"Asian tiger\" economies that they had bankrolled over the previous decade. The resulting turmoil in Indonesia resulted in the overthrow of the notorious dictator President Suharto, who had borrowed heavily from the international community \u2013 including the World Bank \u2013 to fund his regime. The strict conditions placed on a rescue package offered to Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund were widely seen as making the situation worse. But after more than a decade of reform and reconstruction, Indonesia is well on the road to recovery \u2013 it chalked up growth of more than 6% in 2011. Mulyani says that Indonesia's situation in the 1990s was actually much harder than that of Greece today, whose neighbours are rallying to its aid and where private lenders are expected to agree a writedown, or \"haircut\", on their bond holdings. \"They are a little bit lucky, if I can say that, because they actually secured debt reduction through the haircut; in Indonesia, we didn't have that luxury.\" Asked whether she has sympathy with Greece's fears about surrendering control over its domestic policies, her response is similarly unflinching. \"If you are allowing yourself to grow your debt to 200% [of GDP], then at some point the ones who are lending you the money are going to have a say about how you manage things,\" she says. In 2005, she was declared the world's best finance minister by Euromoney magazine, and in 2008, the world's 23rd most powerful woman by Forbes. Today, she is in charge of operations in Asia and Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East for the World Bank. As one of the Bank's three managing directors under president Robert Zoellick, Mulyani is the embodiment of the growing role that middle-income countries \u2013 such as Indonesia, but also China, India and Brazil \u2013 are playing in the international community, including in delivering overseas aid. She says there are lessons for every country from the experience of these emerging economies. Even in the world's richest nations, it has become increasingly clear that generating GDP growth alone is not enough. \"When you talk about inequality and disparity \u2013 here, in many advanced countries the bitterness is growing,\" she says, arguing that politicians must focus on \"making sure that not only a few people can enjoy so excessively while the majority feel they have to work so hard\". She also defends the Bank's continuing involvement in China, India and other middle-income countries against the scepticism of some critics \u2013 including Conservative back-benchers who have questioned the need for aid to India. \"In middle-income countries, inequality becomes a problem because you can see there is a layer of people who are doing well, while the poor are still stuck there. We have 300 million poor in India.\" These days, she says, the Bank often provides just 10% of the costs of a programme, with the recipient government paying the rest; her officials offer other support and advice, and encourage one country to learn from another. She cites Brazil's popular Bolsa Fam\u00edlia scheme, which fights poverty by offering cash supplements to families whose children attend school regularly. Mulyani concedes that traditional lenders such as the World Bank are at risk of being outflanked by fast-moving new players such as China, which is less fastidious about human rights abuses or political corruption. China's increasing influence across the developing world, including in scores of African nations, is bringing a dramatic and much-needed boost to inward investment, but carries with it risks of political interference, and allegations of a new era of colonialism. If the west is too slow to react, she says, \"there will be a new player who is very pragmatic, who will close their eyes to all these principles and will just give money.\" She also has tough words for international aid agencies, which she had first-hand experience of dealing with when she oversaw the rebuilding of Aceh after the tsunami in 2004. \"Everyone with all those good intentions came to help Indonesia rebuild from the tsunami; but the co-ordination problem was very big, because they came with their own way of doing business; they came with the inflexibility of their own governance.\" Donor co-ordination is becoming a buzzword among NGOs, and one of Mulyani's jobs is to try to get the agencies, together with philanthropic bodies such as the Gates Foundation and rising powers such as China, to co-operate. The Bank and its sister organisation the International Monetary Fund have been widely criticised for working with the authoritarian regimes that were overthrown by the protestors in the Arab spring. Mulyani insists the Bank has no choice but to work with whatever government is in place in its client states; but she does concede that the revolutions that swept through the Middle East last year have prompted a new approach. \"The Arab spring is actually giving us the underlying engagement with the country, which in the past has only gone through the government. Now, reaching out and communicating with the people is becoming very important, and technology can facilitate that. In short, the way we engage with these countries has changed.\" She says there will be an urgent need to satisfy the aspirations of the protesters who took to the streets in their millions, not just for more democratic, transparent government, but for a more equitable economy: \"They want to have a job, and jobs can only be created when you manage the economy right: you have to restore growth, and you have to make sure it's inclusive, you have to protect the poor.\" She says her experience in Indonesia, as it battled to emerge from political revolution and a painful sovereign debt crisis, suggests that the path to normality for the Arab nations will be a long one. \"This is not going to be one smooth, linear process. Some setbacks will happen,\" she says. \"I have my own experience in Indonesia, of course. Sometimes in these transition situations, the new governments are still clumsy and awkward in responding to this new environment in which they operate. The only thing in their DNA is the old regime.\" Mulyani refuses to be drawn on the dying days of another regime, however \u2013 that of Zoellick, whose term ends this summer, and who is unlikely to be reappointed by President Obama, whom Zoellick accused of failing to exercise leadership in global trade talks. In theory, the succession at the Bank is meant to involve an open nominations process, overseen by all its shareholders; but in practice, the US, still the dominant power at the Washington-based lender, is unlikely to release its stranglehold over the job. Mulyani says all the Bank's shareholders \"need to be fully aware of the mission of this institution: it's not just, 'it's my turn'. That's what's incredibly important.\" But on the question of whether it is time for a non-American to get the job, she just breaks into a steely smile.",
