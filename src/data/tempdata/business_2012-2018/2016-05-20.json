      "bodyText": "Some of the biggest US companies have accumulated cash piles worth almost $1.7tn (\u00a31.1tn) \u2013 more than two thirds of it overseas. According to the calculations by ratings agency Moody\u2019s, the five companies hoarding the most cash \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle \u2013 between them held $504bn by the end of last year. The tech sector held 46% of the total. Apple \u2013 described as the \u201ccash king\u201d by the ratings agency \u2013 held $216bn of cash, more than double the $102bn held by the next largest hoarder, Microsoft. The figures will add to the controversy about companies sitting on cash as the data shows they are parking it offshore to avoid the tax bill that would be due on returning it to the US. An estimated $1.2tn of cash was held overseas at the end of 2015 \u2013 about 72% of the $1.68tn cash stockpile, Moody\u2019s said. Of the five big hoarders of cash, three \u2013 Apple, Microsoft and Cisco \u2013 keep more than 90% outside the US. \u201cThis amount reflects the negative tax consequences of permanently repatriating money to the US and the use of domestic cash for dividends, share buybacks and the majority of acquisitions,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. Earlier this year, anti-poverty charity Oxfam had estimated US companies had $1.4tn in subsidiaries based offshore, while the $1.68tn that Moody\u2019s estimates is being stashed by US companies is a sum equivalent to the size of the Canadian economy. \u201cBecause domestic cash is consumed by dividends and share buybacks and is used to pay for the majority of acquisitions, we expect that overseas cash balances will continue to grow unless tax laws are changed to encourage companies to repatriate money,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThere has been little progress toward corporate tax reform that would incentivise US companies to permanently repatriate funds held overseas. At this stage in the political cycle and given strong differences on both sides of the aisle in Washington, we do not expect tax law reform that would prompt overseas cash repatriation,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. But with the US presidential election looming, Moody\u2019s said it did not expect any major tax reforms that would prompt companies to start sending money to the US. Companies can put their cash to use in a number of ways, with capital expenditure \u2013 spending on equipment \u2013 usually the largest use. Payouts to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends is another use, as is making acquisitions. The Moody\u2019s research also shows that US companies have been increasing their cash balances every year since 2007 when the ratings agency first began its research. Nearly $1tn has been added since 2007 when the total was $742bn. The cash is increasingly concentrated among the top 50 hoarders, who held 67% of 2015\u2019s total compared with 58% when the research began. But while cash piles are increasing, so is the amount of debt with borrowing outpacing cash levels for the first time since 2012. Apple has dominated the table since 2009. \u201cSince Apple became the cash king in 2009, its $176 bn increase represents 26% of the total $670bn increase in corporate cash over the same period,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. The biggest cash pile held by a non-tech company is the $39bn in the coffers of pharmaceutical company Pfizer. It was forced to abandon a tie-up with rival Allergan - in what was regarded as the biggest pharmaceutical deal in history - in April after the US government clamped down on so-called tax inversion deals. Such transactions are structured to allow corporations to relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate. The top 50 list includes a number of well-known names such as Ford, Visa, eBay, McDonald\u2019s and Asda-owner WalMart. Moody\u2019s, which analysed more than 1,000 companies, said that to gain a place in the top 50, companies needed $6.12bn of cash, up from $6.07bn last year and $2.9bn in 2007.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers have enjoyed a pick-up in output, largely thanks to food and drink production getting back up and running after flooding hit factories earlier this year. The business group CBI said its latest poll of manufacturers suggested orders had improved in recent weeks, particularly from the domestic market, bringing respite to a sector that has been hurt by weak export demand and an uncertain UK outlook. There have been worries that uncertainty about the outcome of next month\u2019s EU referendum had been prompting companies to delay investment decisions. The Bank of England has warned economic growth could slow further in the second quarter. But the latest economic indicators have painted a mixed picture. The CBI\u2019s survey of nearly 500 manufacturers found output picked up in the three months to May. But it emphasised that most of that was down to a rebound in the food and drink sector, following flooding earlier this year. Carr\u2019s water biscuits were among the foods affected by the winter floods after a Carlisle factory owned by United Biscuits was inundated before Christmas. A variety of other favourite names usually produced at the site were also hit, including McVitie\u2019s ginger nuts, Crawford\u2019s custard creams and Crawford\u2019s shortcake. But the plant \u2013 the second-biggest biscuit factory in Europe \u2013 recently resumed production. The CBI said that, excluding food and drink from its survey results, manufacturing output was little changed in the latest three months. The survey also asked factories about their order books and found 16% of businesses reported an increase in total orders while 24% reported a decrease. That gave a net balance of -8%, an improvement on April\u2019s -11% reading. The balance for export orders was -14% in May, down from April\u2019s -13% reading. \u201cConditions in the manufacturing sector seem to be a little better overall, with improving order books compared with a couple of months ago. But domestic and global uncertainty remains high, alongside lacklustre export demand,\u201d said the CBI\u2019s director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith. Other economists also warned that the outlook remained tough for manufacturers. \u201cSterling will appreciate and export orders will fall if, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU in June,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cMeanwhile, domestic demand for manufactured goods likely will grow at a more gradual pace than in recent years as growth in consumers\u2019 real income slows in response to rising inflation and intensifying austerity.\u201d The poll further clouds the UK economic picture after retail sales figures this week showed a rebound in sales volumes in April, and labour market data revealed a rise in employment to a new record high. Those reports contrasted with surveys suggesting companies are putting off hiring and investment decisions and that consumers have become more cautious ahead of next month\u2019s referendum. The Bank of England has said the upcoming referendum is making it harder to gauge the strength of the underlying economy and that it is treating all economic indicators ahead of the vote with an extra dose of caution. One of its top policymakers, Kristin Forbes, conjured the image of a \u201cfog\u201d obscuring the economic data. In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph published on Friday, Forbes said: \u201cSome of the data is quite solid, and some of the data has been a bit softer. We aren\u2019t quite sure why. \u201cWe don\u2019t have concrete evidence that some of the softening we are seeing now is all referendum-related and uncertainty-related, and there is a chance other things are going on.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of oil rigs in use in the US was unchanged last week after eight weeks of falls. Total rig numbers dropped by 2 to 404, according to the weekly Baker Hughes rig count. The two rigs cut were for gas. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. After Thursday\u2019s market falls on fears of a US interest rate rise in June, investors ended the week in a more positive mood as they decided those fears may have been overdone. Much of the previous day\u2019s declines were regained, with banks and mining shares among the main risers. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After charging higher at the open, London\u2019s FTSE-100 has done a sterling effort of holding onto those gains through the session despite the abject lack of fresh fundamental data to work on. The concerns of a US rate hike that were largely responsible for driving yesterday\u2019s sell-off have been side lined, although the market still seems to be thinking that the chance of monetary policy tightening in June remains well below 50%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 102.97 points or 1.7% at 6156.32, its best one day performance since the middle of April Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.23% to 9916.02 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.67% to 4353.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB put on 1.52% to 17,812.35 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.11% at 8771.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.76% to 639.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 98 points or 0.56%. As for oil, Brent crude is unchanged at the moment at $48.81 a barrel. Speaking of next week\u2019s agenda: Wall Street continues to recover, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 104 points or 0.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analysts at Spreadex, said: A strong open from the Dow Jones ensured Europe brought its gains into the afternoon, though there was little actual reason for Friday\u2019s chunky growth beyond cooler heads prevailing after two days of rate-hike fearing losses. [But] the Dow Jones is still on track for one of its worst weeks (and months) in a while. Monday and Tuesday saw the index pushing 17800 thanks to the Goldman Sachs-inspired surge from Brent Crude. Yet since then the Dow has suffered, with first the best US inflation figure since February 2013, and then that surprisingly hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes from April, spooking the index\u2019s rate-hike adverse investors. It will be interesting to see where the Dow is this time next week. By then the second estimate first quarter GDP reading will have been released, and without any upwards revisions to that woeful 0.5% (at the annualised rate) the central bank\u2019s hawks may find their cause undermined by the seriously weak US growth, something that could work in the Dow\u2019s favour. More signs of a strong US housing market. Existing home sales rose by 1.7% in April to an annual rate of 5.45m, better than the 5.4m expected by economists. March\u2019s figure was revised up from 5.33m to 5.36m. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the increase signalled slowly building momentum for the housing market this spring: Primarily driven by a convincing jump in the Midwest, where home prices are most affordable, sales activity overall was at a healthy pace last month as very low mortgage rates and modest seasonal inventory gains encouraged more households to search for and close on a home. Except for in the West \u2014 where supply shortages and stark price growth are hampering buyers the most \u2014 sales are meaningfully higher than a year ago in much of the country. Now here\u2019s something. Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins spent more than \u00a318,000 on taxis in eight months despite a clampdown in costs at all the supermarket\u2019s operations. Sarah Butler\u2019s full story is here: The rebound in global markets continues as Wall Street opens. As investors came to terms with all the talk of a US rate rise next month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered 78 points or 0.45% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.25% higher and Nasdaq climbed 0.39%. A number of members of the US Federal Reserve have spent the week suggesting a rate rise in June was not off the table, which the minutes of the last meeting released on Wednesday were more hawkish than expected. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: William Dudley of the New York Fed [gave] the game away somewhat...when he said that market pricing of Fed hike odds was way too low prior to the minutes, which would suggest that the events of the past week or so have been predominantly a process of expectations realignment. He also suggested that a move in July was probably more likely given the proximity of the UK vote. Consumer confidence in Belgium stabilised in May after falling for four consecutive months, according to the latest survey from the National Bank of Belgium. The index stood at -8, the same as April and the Bank said: On the one hand, consumers\u2019 forecasts for macroeconomic developments in Belgium have got gloomier. Fears of a rise in the unemployment rate over the next twelve months have grown considerably, while expectations about the general economic situation have been revised downwards slightly. On the other hand, households have become more optimistic about their own personal situation. They are now expecting their finances to improve a little over the coming year, and, notably, to save more money. Back with Brexit and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said the UK will not get friendly treatment from the EU if it votes to leave. He told Le Monde that \u201cDeserters will not be welcomed with open arms.\u201d My colleague Andrew Sparrow has the details in the politics live blog: European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici - who warned there was no Plan B in the event of Brexit - has also been talking about Greece, ahead of the country\u2019s vote on reforms this weekend and Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. He said the EU was making good progress on Greece and said he hoped to reach a global deal on Greek debt soon. Ensuring the sustainability of Greek debt was fundamental, he added. But Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund are still far apart on Greek debt relief, and a decision on the issue on Tuesday is in doubt, Reuters is reporting. Meanwhile a Greek parliamentary committee has approved the reform measures which will be voted on on Sunday. Kathimerini reports: A multi-bill bundling together a series of reforms that Greece must legislate to unlock further rescue loans was approved by a parliamentary committee on Friday ahead of a plenary session vote on Sunday. The bill, which details a slew of new tax increases, a new privatization fund, and a contingency mechanism that would automatically cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets, was backed by leftist SYRIZA and rightwing Independent Greeks who form the governing coalition. It was opposed by opposition New Democracy as well as PASOK, the Communist Party, Potami, Union of Centrists and Golden Dawn. On Saturday the bill is to go to Parliament\u2019s plenary session ahead of a vote scheduled for Sunday. But four Greek unions have issued a statement criticising the tax measures in the bill, according to the Athens Macedonian news agency. Meanwhile, in China health authorities have slashed the prices of three expensive drugs made by Britain\u2019s GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, and China\u2019s Betta Pharmaceuticals. Reuters reports: The National Health and Family Planning Commission said the cost of GSK\u2019s hepatitis B drug Viread would fall to 490 yuan ($75) a month from 1,500, while AstraZeneca\u2019s lung cancer pill Iressa drops to 7,000 yuan from 15,000. Icotinib, another lung cancer drug made by Betta Pharmaceuticals, will come down to 5,500 from 12,000 yuan a month. The Commission said in March it would cut prices of some medicines used to treat serious diseases, including cancer, but had not named the drugs involved. GSK, which has struggled to rebuild sales in China following a damaging bribery scandal that landed it with a record fine in 2014, said it expected the lower price to stimulate increased volume sales. At the reduced price, its hepatitis drug will now be covered by Chinese reimbursement policies, which means patients will no longer have to pay the entire price out of pocket. The high cost of healthcare is a major point of contention in China, where low levels of state health insurance coverage means patients and their families often burn through savings to buy drugs to treat chronic disease. At the G7 summit in Japan, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the G7 finance leaders need to find ways to use all the \u201cpolicy levers\u201d they have to ward off a global economic slowdown. Finance ministers and heads of central banks spent Friday discussing ways to use monetary policy, government spending and longer-term reforms to help support growth. The common view among the G7 industrialised financial leaders was that while there is no one-size-fits-all approach, all economies are facing a stifling lack of demand, and the private sector must play a key role in kickstarting growth. Lew told reporters: The G-7 is meeting at a significant time not because it\u2019s a time of crisis, but it\u2019s a time when there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy and there a need for us to talk to each other about what we\u2019re seeing and what tools we have to use to promote the most balanced use of all the policy levers that we have. The Group of 20 meeting in Shanghai in February was successful because there was a renewed commitment to refrain from competitive currency devaluation to communicate closely with each other other \u201cso we won\u2019t surprise each other,\u201d he said, expressing hope that the current G7 summit would be equally effective. It carries on tomorrow. The Brexit impact is still tough to quantify, says Allan Monks at JPMorgan Chase, following comments by Bank of England policy maker Kristin Forbes this morning. While signs of an EU referendum-related impact on the UK growth data have become clearer in recent weeks \u2013 a story that so many had been waiting to tell \u2013 we have argued that there could still be other factors at work too, including a fragile global backdrop. These sentiments were echoed in comments by MPC member Kristin Forbes in an interview with the Belfast Telegraph today. Another member, Jan Vlieghe, yesterday also highlighted that policy easing cannot be dismissed even under a vote to remain \u2013 if, for example, growth failed to recover from its current soft patch. While the relative influence of Brexit on UK growth cannot be known for sure, the extent to which the activity data are weakening ahead of the referendum will be an important factor for BoE policy decisions, whatever the outcome of the vote. European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici has said that policymakers \u201chave no plan B\u201d if Britain voted to leave the EU in June. He told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 finance ministers\u2019 summit in Sendai in northern Japan: We have no plan B for Brexit. Our only plan is for Britain to remain in a united Europe. Looks like something was lost in translation. A Japanese finance ministry official has clarified, again according to Reuters, that As\u014d meant to say that some European ministers thought it would be good for the UK to stay in the EU. Some snaps from the G7 meeting in Japan on Reuters. The EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the general mood among G7 countries suggested that they wanted Britain to stay in the EU. But according to the Japanese finance minister Tar\u014d As\u014d, some European countries thought Brexit would be good in the long run. We will report more details as soon as we get them. British factory output is rising at the strongest pace since August, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Order books also improved, although they continued to decline. The survey of 489 manufacturers found that a rebound in the food and drink sector, following flooding in parts of the country earlier this year, drove an increase in overall output in the three months to May. Excluding food and drink, the output balance was stable, with the other 17 manufacturing sectors showing minimal movement. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s director of economics, said: Conditions in the manufacturing sector seem to be a little better overall, with improving order books compared with a couple of months ago. But domestic and global uncertainty remains high, alongside lacklustre export demand. Despite recent choppiness in emerging markets, China and India remain significant sources of potential demand. An exports commission would enable exporters to better exploit the growth opportunities provided by these and other growth markets. Manufacturers need to work in partnership with the Government to embrace long-term opportunities and trends, particularly in digital. A greater focus is also required on developing the right skills in the sector, managing energy costs, and encouraging further R&amp;D investment. Several European Central Bank policymakers have backed president Mario Draghi\u2019s wait-and-see stance today. The ECB unveiled a big stimulus package in March but several key elements, such as like corporate debt purchases and new ultra-cheap loans to banks, have yet to be implemented. Draghi called for patience last month, dampening market expectations for more stimulus. Estonian central bank chief Ardo Hansson told a conference this morning, according to Reuters: The monetary policy stance should remain broadly accommodative at this point ... [and we need] to maintain a degree of patience. A lot of accommodation that has been decided already is still in the pipeline and it will work its way through. Slovak central bank chief Jozef Makuch also saw no need for further measures. Interest rates can still be lower still and we are now testing how low they can go. But if this tool must continue to be used, then I must urge caution so [we do not] bring about a totally counterproductive threat to financial stability. The scope for deploying standard instruments is almost exhausted. As reported earlier, Benoit Coeur\u00e9, a member of the ECB\u2019s executive board, told a Japanese newspaper that there were no plans to further reduce the deposit rate \u2013 which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u2013 for the time being. Eurostar has said that passenger numbers have fallen in the wake of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, as people from the US and Asia have been afraid to travel to Europe. You can read more here. And here is our full story about France\u2019s fears over the planned \u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Oil prices are pushing higher today, getting close to six-month highs, as the global oil glut eased due to a series of production outages in Nigeria, Canada and Libya. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is now trading at $48.86 after rising to $49.26 earlier, close to the six-month high of $49.85 reached a couple of days ago. In Japan, finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 industrialised nations are gathering to discuss what to do about flagging global growth. George Osborne is there \u2013 The pound is having a good week. It has retreated somewhat after hitting a 3 1/2 month high against a trade-weighted basket of currencies yesterday, but remains on track for its best weekly performance in nearly 10 months \u2013 up 2% this week. Sterling has been boosted by strong retail sales numbers for April and an opinion poll suggesting that the \u201cremain\u201d camp had extended its lead ahead of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. An Ipsos-Mori poll found 55% of those surveyed supported staying in the EU, while just 37% wanted to leave. An open letter by 250 British celebrities including Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter appears to have had little impact on markets. The actors, musicians, writers and artists warned that if Britain were to leave the European Union it would become \u201can outsider shouting from the wings\u201d. The planned \u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse raises competition concerns, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, has said. His comments echoed those made by economy minister Emmanuel Macron in February, but Sapin\u2019s comments carry more weight as he is in charge of banking and financial industry issues in France. The proposed merger would create a group similar in scale to ICE, which owns the New York stock exchange and has taken a big slice of Europe\u2019s derivatives markets, and would leave smaller European rivals such as Euronext Paris far behind. ICE, which initially said it was considering a bid for the LSE, ruled itself out earlier this month. Sapin told Reuters: I want to express the concern of the French government on this tie-up. We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe.\u201d The merger of these two entities will result in a large group which could hold within it a majority of the tools that make our markets function efficiently. That poses a competition problem, and we want to make sure the European Commission gets involved to avoid a situation where a dominant position arises. European stock markets have opened higher, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London up 85 points, or 1.4%, at 6138.36 CAC 40 in Paris up 56 points, or 1.4%, at 4343.15 Dax in Frankfurt up nearly 118 points, or 1.2%, at 9913.57 Here in Britain, Ladbrokes and Coral could be forced to sell up to 400 betting shops if the \u00a32.3bn merger of the two bookmakers is to go ahead, the competition regulator has said. The Competition and Markets Authority said the proposed merger between Britain\u2019s second and third largest betting shop chains would reduce choice for customers in \u201ca large number of local areas\u201d. You can read the full story here. Turning to corporate news... Deutsche Bank suffered a damaging investor revolt over executive pay last night. Germany\u2019s biggest lender held its annual meeting in Frankfurt yesterday, where more than half of shareholders (51.9%) voted against a new pay scheme for its top executives, and just 48.1% backed it. The vote was non-binding, however. Under the pay plan, in addition to bonuses linked to the bank\u2019s and their own performance, divisional heads will also get a bonus linked to their division\u2019s performance. Chairman Paul Achleitner suggested that the bank would take the vote into account when implementing the pay plan. A shareholder proposal for a special audit of whether top managers breached their obligations in how they handled the bank\u2019s litigation issues was narrowly rejected \u2013 46.4% of investors voted in favour, and 53.6% against. You can view the voting results here, and listen to the speeches made at the AGM. The company\u2019s chief executive John Cryan said the bank expected further big legal costs this year related to a series of scandals (such as Libor) that have damaged its reputation and hurt profits \u2013 but is getting closer to the end of its litigation nightmare. I am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned. The bank has set aside \u20ac5.4bn to settle pending litigation this year. Cryan, a Brit, spoke in German \u2013 which went down well with shareholders, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A Bank of England policymaker, Kristin Forbes, has said that the central bank had no concrete evidence that recent weaker UK economic data was all related to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. She told the Belfast Telegraph during a visit to Northern Ireland that she believed the uncertainty was weighing on businesses and their investment plans, and that any doubts could be lifted quite quickly if there is a \u201cremain\u201d vote. But she added: We don\u2019t have concrete evidence that some of the softening we are seeing now is all referendum-related and uncertainty related, and there is a chance other things are going on. Meanwhile, a senior International Monetary Fund official said last night that negotiations on a new bailout programme for Greece should focus on a long grace period and maturity extensions along with \u201cvery low interest rates\u201d. IMF chief spokesman Gerry Rice also said that the fund\u2019s board won\u2019t approve a new bailout unless it contains debt relief measures from European lenders along with policies to boost Greece\u2019s fiscal savings. He declined for confirm reports that the IMF is pushing for a pause in Greek debt repayments until 2020. He said at a regular weekly briefing: We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet next Tuesday to try to hammer out a deal with Greece on a package of steps to ensure Athens meets future fiscal targets, with hopes for a political agreement on future debt relief for Greece. A European Central Bank policymaker has poured cold water on hopes that the central bank could cut interest rates further. Benoit Coeur\u00e9, member of the ECB\u2019s executive board, said there are no plans to reduce the deposit rate \u2013 which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u2013 for the time being. The negative deposit rate, effectively a charge on banks for hoarding cash, has been criticised by banks and investors for squeezing their profits and distorting financial markets. Coeur\u00e9 said that banks had largely benefited from the ECB\u2019s loose monetary policy and that markets continued to work smoothly. He told Japanese newspaper The Yomiuri Shimbun: It is in principle possible to cut this rate further, but there is currently no plan to do so. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Signs of hawkishness among US Federal Reserve members sent global markets tumbling yesterday, marking another disappointing week for stocks. US markets finished lower but recovered from the lows hit earlier in the day. Asian stock markets rose overnight, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng up 1.2% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.5% higher. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher. The meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers kicks off in Sendai in Japan today, where will be discussing ways of breathing life into the sluggish global economy as well as risks from a potential \u201cBrexit\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank has warned it faces rising costs because it is looking for ways to top up the pay of staff while it is blocked from paying bonuses by the Bank of England. The bank, no longer 100% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes after a rescue deal three years ago, admitted that its costs would go up as a result of its inability to pay bonuses as long as it has not met targets set by the Bank of England for its financial strength. Pay rises could be one option, although decisions have not yet been made about how the bank will tackle the problem. \u201cTo remain competitive and to enable the attraction and retention of employees, the bank will need to change its remuneration structure and this is likely to increase costs,\u201d the Co-op bank said. The bank, bailed out in 2013 by the hedge funds that owned its bonds, said in April that a string of charges for conduct matters such as payment protection insurance and prolonged low interest rates would mean it would take a year longer than expected to reach the goals set by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. Its revised plan, stretching to 2020, has been approved by the regulator. The bank\u2019s crucial regulatory capital \u2013 as measured by a ratio of earnings and equity against its assets \u2013 is 14.1%, down from 15.5%. But the Bank of England also sets a top-up buffer of capital too, individual to each bank. The Co-op bank said it did \u201cnot now meet its individual capital guidance and combined buffer. As noted in our annual report and accounts, under the PRA rulebook, not meeting the combined buffer prevents the bank from creating an obligation to pay variable remuneration during the period of non-compliance.\u201d Niall Booker - the chief executive who is expected to leave at the end of the year after joining in May 2013 when the bank was on the brink of collapse, - warned that conditions for his turnaround plan \u201cremain challenging\u201d. However, he pointed out that the core part of the bank had returned to profit in the first three months of 2016. \u201cMarket conditions for asset sales meant that the pace of deleveraging in non-core slowed during the first quarter and macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, which may affect the bank\u2019s operating environment during the course of the turnaround plan,\u201d said Booker, as the bank issued a first quarter trading update. Co-op bank - now 20% owned by the mutual Co-op Group of supermarkets and funeral homes - was regarded as a major challenger to the big four high street banks before it was plunged into crisis and had to pull out of taking over the TSB branches now owned by the Spanish bank Sabadell. In the first quarter, the number of current account customers fell slightly, by 6,000, to 1.425 million although it launched a new \u00a3150 switching offer in May. The Co-op said that despite the fall in the number of accounts, balances held by customers had gone up doing the period. It is closing 54 branches to cut costs. Booker said there had been improvement in the way customers assessed the bank through what are called net promoter scores (NPS). \u201cWe have seen an increase in our current account NPS scores which further emphasises the consistently strong service levels being delivered in our contact centres and branches alongside continued improvement in our digital channels.\u201d The trading update was entitled \u201cviable core bank franchise continues to emerge\u201d - a theme being developed by Booker who is trying to dispose of risky loans housed in a non-core operation to focus on activities such as current accounts and mortgages. In April, Booker, who is leading the turnaround team at the bank, admitted the bank\u2019s annual losses for the previous year had more than doubled to \u00a3611m. He is expected to be replaced by Liam Coleman, who became deputy chief executive in May. He took over, following a career at HSBC, at a time when the Co-op bank was in turmoil after the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s had slashed the bank\u2019s rating by six notches.

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has suffered a stinging rebuke over pay from its investors just hours after shareholders in rival Deutsche Bank rejected its remuneration plans outright. A third of investors who voted on Goldman\u2019s pay plans opposed them, despite chief executive Lloyd Blankfein accepting his first pay cut in four years, from $24m (\u00a316.5m) to $22.6m. A sizeable group of shareholders expressed their displeasure with Blankfein serving as both chief executive and chairman, a dual role that is seen as taboo in the City of London but is still practised on Wall Street. Although a motion to separate the two roles was not passed at the company\u2019s annual meeting in Jersey City, about 30% of voting investors supported the proposal. Shareholders aired their grievances after a tough start to 2016, with revenues in the first quarter down 40% as volatile markets saw traders pull in their horns. Deutsche Bank also suffered a damaging investor revolt at its annual meeting, when shareholders rejected a new pay scheme for top managers, lambasting the bank\u2019s mounting legal bills and falling share price. At the annual meeting of Germany\u2019s largest lender in Frankfurt on Thursday, more than half of shareholders (51.9%) voted against a new pay scheme for its top managers. The vote was non-binding, however. Under the pay plan, in addition to bonuses linked to the bank\u2019s and their own personal performance, divisional heads will get a bonus linked to their division\u2019s performance. Deutsche\u2019s chairman, Paul Achleitner, suggested that the bank would take the vote into account when implementing the pay plan. Under fire from shareholders, he defended his record and sought to head off criticism that he had been too slow to make changes to top management and strategy. The bank slumped to a record \u20ac6.8bn (\u00a35.2bn) loss in 2015 and its share price has halved over the past year. It has suspended dividend payments. \u201cI am sticking to my duty and to my responsibilities,\u201d Achleitner told 5,400 shareholders at the annual meeting. \u201cWe in the supervisory board are now confident that Deutsche Bank is on the right track,\u201d said the 59-year-old Austrian, who has chaired the bank since 2012. When Achleitner announced that he would seek another term in 2017, there was silence among shareholders. By contrast, John Cryan, who took over as chief executive last July, and departing co-chief executive J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, received applause. A shareholder proposal for a special audit of how top managers had handled the bank\u2019s litigation issues was narrowly rejected \u2013 46.4% of investors voted in favour and 53.6% against. Cryan said the group expected further big legal charges this year related to a series of scandals, such as manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange rates, that have damaged the bank\u2019s reputation and hurt profits \u2013 but added that it was getting closer to the end of the litigation saga. Cryan, who is British but spoke in German, said: \u201cI am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned.\u201d The bank has set aside \u20ac5.4bn to settle pending litigation this year. To applause from shareholders, Cryan admitted: \u201cLitigation expenses of this magnitude are completely unacceptable.\u201d Fund manager Ingo Speich, of Union investment, one of Deutsche\u2019s biggest shareholders, said the bank was mired in the \u201cmost serious crisis in its history\u201d. Speich described the share price performance as a disaster, noting that the bank\u2019s market value of around \u20ac20bn was less than the amount raised from shareholders since the financial crisis. He added: \u201cAfter a decade of mismanagement, Deutsche Bank is a restructuring case today.\u201d He said Cryan would have to clean up the mess left by his predecessors. Other shareholders backed Cryan and the newly installed executive team. Andreas Thomae, a fund manager at Dekabank, said: \u201cWe expressly welcome this new beginning.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may be a jungle on the British high street as retailers struggle to survive in the face of rising competition from discounters and the internet, but the colourful cut-price chain Tiger is right at home. Aldi and Lidl get the high-profile news coverage as they hammer traditional supermarkets, but the Danish retailer is one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing businesses. Zebra, Tiger\u2019s Copenhagen-based parent company, says total sales in the UK rose 69% last year to601m Danish krone (\u00a362m) as it opened 31 new stores, taking its total number of locations in Britain to nearly 80. The UK leapfrogged Denmark and Italy to become the largest market for the group, founded by the former market trader Lennart Lajboschitz. The chain is growing at such a pace \u2013 opening one or two shops a week around the world, including in the US \u2013 that it struggled to meet demand over Christmas. When the retail expert Mary Portas was asked what she might do to save the BHS chain, which fell into administration in April, she suggested putting Tiger on the ground floor, replacing its fashion collections with the Japanese cut-price clothing chain Uniqlo or with Primark products and bringing in furnishings from Ikea. Philip Bier is the head of Tiger\u2019s business in the south-east of England \u2013 the first UK store opened in Basingstoke in 2005. Whether it is the retailer\u2019s heart-shaped washing-up sponges, toothbrush holders in the form of a mini-garden or the cheerful retro music played in stores, Bier says shoppers are looking for something to entertain them. If they want more prosaic items, he says, they will go online or to the supermarket. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to be an ordinary experience,\u201d Bier says of the chain, which does not sell online. \u201cThat plays to a bigger view of retail today. If you don\u2019t make things entertaining in today\u2019s market you\u2019ve had it. Footfall is falling across the high street. You have to ask: \u2018How do I react to that?\u2019 Customers are not coming in unless it\u2019s fun. We have to make them want to come out and not sit at home.\u201d Bier, a former architectural photographer who moved to the UK from Denmark to study, says another downturn is likely to lead to the loss of more retailers who are \u201cnot relevant\u201d. \u201cInternet shopping is a lot about what you need, not browsing. Our best sellers are not things that customers set out to buy that day. I don\u2019t think anyone ever set out to buy a poster-sized Mona Lisa in a gilded frame,\u201d he says referring to one of Tiger\u2019s more quirky success stories. Bier says Tiger thrives on putting a humorous twist on everyday home and kitchenware, stationery and toys \u2013 the categories increase or shrink in importance depending on the time of year. The list of bestsellers is eclectic \u2013 from a colourful wire head massager to a wooden stacking game similar to Jenga. As a couple of students jig around to the music and mess about with fox-shaped oven gloves, Bier adds: \u201cIt\u2019s something to put a smile on your face. We don\u2019t just think about the product itself but the experience of using it. There are a lot of things to encourage happiness in being together. Tiger\u2019s founder really wanted to give people the opportunity to do things that they might otherwise be priced out of or need a car to get to.\u201d Prices go from \u00a31 to \u00a330 \u2013 up from \u00a31 to \u00a32 when Bier opened its first UK store \u2013 but the bulk of goods are less than \u00a35. There are no sales and each Tiger store offloads unsold items to local charities. Aside from price, convenience is another important part of the formula. Tiger is cashing in on the departure of toy shops, furniture specialists and arts and crafts stores from the high street. Its shops are generally located in prime spots in trendy areas. Bier runs 38 stores. Reading, Oxford and Southampton will be included in six to eight new UK openings this year. He recently opened his first outlet in a tube station \u2013 at St James\u2019s Park \u2013 and wants to do more. But he says he is very careful about selecting new sites, waiting years for the right location to come up on Kings Road in London, for example. Bier runs the biggest and most established of five separate companies that operate Tiger in the UK. Operating across London and the south-east, it is a 50-50 joint venture with Zebra, as are all the other companies, except in Scotland where the Danish parent runs stores directly. Bier\u2019s personal money has been on the line since the early days so he has exercised caution in opening new stores, helping the chain outperform similar rivals such as Clas Ohlson, which is closing more than half its UK stores, and Tchibo, which quit the UK in 2009. His investment is paying off handsomely. Tiger Retail, the entity Bier co-owns, paid a dividend of \u00a3550,000 in the year to December 2014, up more than tenfold on the \u00a350,000 paid out a year before, as sales rose 44% to \u00a330.7m and profits soared 93% to \u00a34.8m. Bier believes Tiger can be as influential as its fellow Scandinavian chain Ikea. It is certainly eating up the competition.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Tesco Bank spent more than \u00a318,000 on London taxis in just eight months last year, being taken to upmarket restaurants, private members\u2019 clubs and the supermarket\u2019s various head offices despite the tough new approach to costs adopted by the grocer\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis. When Lewis arrived at the business in October 2014, he ordered the immediate sale of the supermarket\u2019s fleet of corporate aircraft and said he would be taking the train rather than a car into London from Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office. That saving alone, he said, would pay for an extra member of staff in store for a day. Taking the train \u201cequates to one day for one colleague in-store,\u201d Lewis told trade journal Retail Week. Despite Lewis\u2019s cost-saving decree, Benny Higgins, the chief executive of the supermarket\u2019s retail bank, spent more than the annual salary of a shop assistant on London taxis between March and the end of October last year, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The bills, claimed by Higgins and his PA on his behalf, included more than \u00a3700 on taxis booked for airport transfers with Higgins\u2019s daughters named as passengers, and thousands of pounds on journeys to the Royal Opera House, private members\u2019 clubs and a string of upmarket restaurants. Some of the taxi claims, for relatively short journeys, run to hundreds of pounds. Higgins, who is fond of quoting poetry and is known as a voracious reader, visited literary clubs The Academy and The Society Club and The London Capital Club as well as Richard Caring\u2019s Ivy Club all by taxi. He also billed the company for journeys to Japanese restaurant Roka, Belgravia bistro La Poule au Pot, and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Bread Street Kitchen. The taxi fares suggest Higgins tends to spend at least half the week in London, even though the head office of Tesco Personal Finance, the division which includes the bank, is in Edinburgh. A Tesco source said: \u201cThe costs are just out of control.\u201d Higgins, one of Scotland\u2019s most high-profile banking figures, has been in charge of Tesco Personal Finance since 2008. He spent more than \u00a3170 \u2013 more than twice the daily earnings of a Tesco shop assistant \u2013 on trips to and from the Royal Opera House from the Soho Hotel \u2013 a 15-minute walk. A Friday trip to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum \u2013 five stops on the Underground which would have cost less than \u00a35 with an Oyster card \u2013 resulted in a \u00a3389.85 taxi bill for Tesco. The bills submitted to the company do not explain why the taxi charges are so high, but they detail the trip, the date, any \u201cpriority fee\u201d and the passenger\u2019s name. He also billed the supermarket \u00a32,000 for trips to Tesco\u2019s corporate offices in Cheshunt, Welwyn Garden City and Finsbury Pavement. Higgins also spent more than \u00a38,600 on trips to and from the airport, not including those for his daughters or non-Tesco executives . On at least one occasion Higgins claims for more than one trip from his London base to the airport on the same weekend. The Tesco banker uses the Soho Hotel \u2013 a boutique hotel just down the road from his London apartment \u2013 for business meetings when he is in the capital and, according to his taxi expenses, he is there several times a week, often entertaining at his favourite table. Last year he also made taxi trips to Sopwell House, a Georgian country house hotel and spa near St Albans, east London boutique hotel Andaz and Hanbury Manor, a five-star hotel and country club in Hertfordshire. There are also trips that seem unlikely to be connected to the work of Tesco Bank including a \u00a3217.56 return trip to literary agent Madeleine Milburn, and visits to a skin clinic, designer furniture store and an antiques dealer. One source said staff were unhappy that a director who earned \u00a32.2m in the year to March, up from \u00a31.7m a year before, appeared to be claiming taxi fares for personal trips while the bank faced tricky times. A Tesco spokesperson refused to comment on the detail or scale of the claims, or whether Higgins\u2019s claims were sanctioned, but said: \u201cAll Tesco colleagues adhere to a clear policy that allows travel and other expenses for business reasons.\u201d Having previously held senior roles at RBS and Standard Life, Higgins is a multi-millionaire, having left HBOS in 2007 with a \u00a32m golden goodbye after less than two years\u2019 work. The source said there was anger that there had been no major changes to processes and Higgins continued to sign off his own expenses, including large personal taxi fares, even after the issue had been raised at a senior level within Tesco on previous occasions, under the current and former management. \u201cNobody is allowed to say anything. This is a man who could easily afford for personal taxis for his kids going to the airport.\u201d Higgins also signed off large expenses for other directors. While he personally was the biggest spender on London taxis, Therese Procter, the bank\u2019s people director, appeared to be by far the biggest claimant for other non-travel expenses. She billed the company for more than \u00a39,000 of expenses in eight months \u2013 including membership of the exclusive Ivy Club in London, favoured by celebrities such as Kate Moss and Kevin Spacey. Underlying pretax profits at Tesco Personal Finance slid 11% to \u00a3197m in the year to March 2016 excluding restructuring costs of \u00a31m and losses on financial instruments, movements on derivatives and hedge accounting of \u00a38.1m. The bank cut about 240 head office jobs last year and is understood to be considering a further 10% to 20% cut in head count as the bank tries to offset the loss of income from fees charged to retailers on credit card payments. The planned cuts comes after the wider Tesco group axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the bank last year. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores. Lewis has also closed down the grocer\u2019s longstanding head office in Cheshunt as part of his cost-cutting programme. Store staff received a 3.1% increase in basic pay this year, ahead of the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s but the deal was offset by cuts in extra pay for Sunday and bank holiday shifts from July. Lewis, who was hired from Unilever to turn around Tesco in the wake of a sales and profits collapse, has made clear that he is looking at costs across the business. He has sold a number of businesses, ranging from its Blinkbox books and video-streaming business to its huge grocery business in South Korea to pay off debts. Lewis is still trying to offload other businesses, including the Giraffe restaurant chain and the Dobbies Garden Centre business. He has pledged to \u201clook at every aspect of cost and see how that affects the customer\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Many high street chains may be struggling, but Moss Bros remains in fashion. The tailoring group has reported a better than expected 5% rise in total like for like sales in the 15 weeks to the middle of May, with margins up 430 basis points on the previous year as it decided not to run a mid-season sale. Online sales now account for 10.7% of total sales after the development of its retail and hire websites. In a statement issued ahead of its annual meeting, the company said it was confident it would meet full year expectations. The positive news, coming just a few weeks after another tailor Austin Reed went into administration, has pushed its shares up 3p to 104p. Analyst Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a buy note, saying: This update shows that the company is very much in a growth phase and supports our view that the stock is undervalued. First, earnings, which after doubling in the last three years, are forecast to grow by between 15% and 20% per annum. Second, the company has a strong balance sheet with cash reported at \u00a317m at January 2016 (18% of the market capitalisation). Third, the company could become cashflow positive in2017 ensuring that the dividend, currently yielding almost 6%, is able to be increased at the same rate as earnings. The stock is rated at 6.2 times 2017 enterprise value/EBITDA and 20.0 times 2017 earnings on conservative forecasts. We reiterate our buy recommendation and our target price of 120p. A further twenty stores are being refurbished during the year. Hire after two disappointing years, is recovering. On-line sales, which grew by 36% in the period, now have real momentum. The company has recently combined its Retail and Hire master files which will enable it to cross sell between the two divisions, more easily sell accompanying categories and encourage repeat orders. It has also launched the \u2018Tailor me\u2019 promotion. In addition, the company is well placed to develop the brand overseas over the medium term helped by recent appointments to the business. Liberum also put out a buy recommendation, saying: Moss Bros has today provided another confident trading statement. Like for like sales in both retail and Hire remain strong and due to a lower focus on promotions, improved sell-through rates, gross margins are strongly up. While we leave forecasts unchanged, we believe these gross margin gains and the strong like for like sales can be delivered over the course of the year as a whole. We remain confident that the group\u2019s refurbished estate, clear branded offer and price architecture are resulting in market share gains. And Peel Hunt was also positive, despite the prospect of Euro 2016 distracting shoppers from the high street: Despite a weak high street backdrop, Moss has reported like for like sales growth of 5% and retail gross margin gains of 430bps over the 15 week year to date period. While football might be a distraction for customers towards the end of the second quarter, the strong start to the year means first half profits look on track for at least around 25% growth year on year. Moss is now clearly demonstrating the brand\u2019s relevance to customers and is now showing signs of meaningful operating leverage.",

On-line sales, which grew by 36% in the period, now have real momentum. The company has recently combined its Retail and Hire master files which will enable it to cross sell between the two divisions, more easily sell accompanying categories and encourage repeat orders. It has also launched the \u2018Tailor me\u2019 promotion. In addition, the company is well placed to develop the brand overseas over the medium term helped by recent appointments to the business. </p> </blockquote> <p>Liberum also put out a buy recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Moss Bros has today provided another confident trading statement. Like for like sales in both retail and Hire remain strong and due to a lower focus on promotions, improved sell-through rates, gross margins are strongly up. While we leave forecasts unchanged, we believe these gross margin gains and the strong like for like sales can be delivered over the course of the year as a whole. We remain confident that the group\u2019s refurbished estate, clear branded offer and price architecture are resulting in market share gains. </p> </blockquote> <p>And Peel Hunt was also positive, despite the prospect of Euro 2016 distracting shoppers from the high street:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite a weak high street backdrop, Moss has reported like for like sales growth of 5% and retail gross margin gains of 430bps over the 15 week year to date period. While football might be a distraction for customers towards the end of the second quarter, the strong start to the year means first half profits look on track for at least around 25% growth year on year. Moss is now clearly demonstrating the brand\u2019s relevance to customers and is now showing signs of meaningful operating leverage. </p> </blockquote>",

The high-speed rail operator linking the UK to mainland Europe said tourists from further afield were choosing other destinations. Eurostar\u2019s chief executive, Nicolas Petrovic, said travellers remained cautious following the attacks at Brussels airport and on the city\u2019s metro system. He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme: \u201cPeople coming from North America and south-east Asia, particularly Japan, are fearful of coming to Europe at all. They don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on and would rather go elsewhere altogether. Hopefully next year international visitors will come back.\u201d Petrovic said the number of people travelling from the UK had rebounded quite quickly following the attacks. Passenger numbers fell to 2.2 million in the three months to the end of March, from 2.3 million a year earlier. Sales revenues were down 6% at \u00a3201m in the first quarter. Eurostar was more upbeat about trading in the last few weeks, reporting a surge in sales as football fans booked rail tickets to the Euro 2016 football tournament in France. The rail operator said the busiest day for travel would be 10 June, when the hosts, France, play Romania in the opening match of the tournament at the Stade de France in Paris. Eurostar runs direct services to the main Euro 2016 host cities including Lille, Paris, Lyon and Marseille, with almost half a million passengers expected to travel from the UK. \u201cWe have seen an unprecedented demand from football supporters keen to get to the Euros by train,\u201d Petrovic said. Eurostar said it was making progress with its plans to open a new route between London and Amsterdam, with the new e320 train tested on the Dutch network for the first time last month. The route is expected to be up and running by the end of next year, with a journey time of about four hours. \u201cWith over 3 million passengers travelling by air between London and Amsterdam, this new route is key to our growth plans,\u201d Petrovic said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have recovered much of the fall seen on Thursday, as worries about a possible US interest rate rise in June recede. Mining shares were among the main risers, regaining some lost ground as copper prices moved higher after signs of more demand from key commodities consumer China. Anglo American has added 30.7p to 610p while Glencore is up 5.2p at 133.3p. Elsewhere Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling has climbed 56p to \u00a313.42 after Citigroup issued a buy note, saying its recent share price decline meant much of the concerns about the outlook were priced into the shares. Overall the FTSE 100 has added 92.60 points to 6145.95, on course for its biggest one day rise since the middle of April. At the moment there are no fallers at all in the leading index. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The FTSE-100 has opened with gains of more than 1%, recovering much of Thursday\u2019s losses as commodity prices start forging their way higher once again. That rally we had seen for the US dollar off the back of the prospect of a US rate hike has stalled, whilst supply disruption fears are driving the price of oil, pushing Brent crude to within a whisker of $50 a barrel. Takeover speculation has helped lift asset management companies, with Aberdeen Asset Management up 12.4p to 281.6p, Henderson Group 13.4p better at 259.3p and Schroders rising 53p to \u00a325.73. The catalyst appears to be comments from Aberdeen chief executive Martin Gilbert, who told Bloomberg he had seen interest from rivals in Europe and Australia, although no formal offers had be received and he would be unlikely to sell anyway. Meanwhile a positive third quarter trading update has lifted merchant bank Close Brothers by 53p to \u00a312.78. Numis said: Following the slightly better than expected third quarter performance we are modestly upgrading our forecasts for Close. Earnings per share moves to 123p this year from 118p and to 122p next year from 119p. Our target price increases from 1565p to 1580p and our recommendation remains buy from our change this morning. We continue to believe that Close will outperform the lenders sub-sector through the cycle. Ladbrokes is up 14p at 133.5p as the regulator said its planned merger with Coral may win approval provided 350 to 400 shops were sold. This is lower than previous estimates of 500. But Spectris has dropped nearly 7% to \u00a316.52 after the electrical engineering group reported a weaker than expected first quarter update and said conditions remained challenging. Investec analyst Michael Blogg said: As Spectris traditionally delivers most of its sales and profits in the second quarter and (especially) the fourth quarter, it is hard to draw conclusions from trading in the first four months of the year. However, a 4% organic revenue decline is not encouraging and it is worse than our relatively downbeat estimates for the first half and 2016. With guidance unchanged (we assume for profits), the onus is likely to be on aggressive shaping of the cost base and capabilities to deliver a more efficient business. Our estimates, target price and recommendation are under review.",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes and Coral could be forced to sell up to 400 betting shops if the \u00a32.3bn merger of the two bookmakers is to go ahead, the competition regulator has said. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the proposed merger between Britain\u2019s second and third largest betting shop chains would reduce choice for customers in \u201ca large number of local areas\u201d. Ladbrokes has more than 2,200 shops in the UK, while Coral has 1,850. A combination of the two companies would create Britain\u2019s largest bookmaker by number of shops, leapfrogging the market leader, William Hill, which has almost 2,400. The CMA said the enlarged company might have to sell 350 to 400 shops to resolve concerns. Martin Cave, chairman of the CMA\u2019s inquiry into the deal, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve provisionally found that the merger between two of the largest bookmakers in the country may be expected to reduce competition and choice for customers in a large number of local areas. \u201cDiscounts and offers of free bets to individual customers are ways betting shops respond to local competition which could be threatened by the merger. We\u2019re also concerned that such a widespread potential reduction in competition at the local level could worsen those elements that are set nationally, such as odds and betting limits.\u201d Ladbrokes shares opened up 7% at about 128p on Friday morning after the CMA announcement, making the bookmaker the biggest early riser on the FTSE 250. A spokesman for Ladbrokes described the CMA\u2019s announcement as a significant step. He added: \u201cOur focus now will be agreeing the remedies with the CMA and finding the appropriate buyer or buyers for the shops.\u201d The CMA said it would consider responses to its provisional findings before reaching a final decision. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to look closely at the exact number of shops and areas that would be involved \u2013 the overall size and complexity may mean that the sales need to be substantially completed before the merger can go ahead,\u201d Cave added. The CMA gave a deadline of 13 June for responses to the provisional findings. If the deal goes ahead, it would be structured as a takeover of private-owned Coral by its bigger rival, the publicly listed Ladbrokes. The combined company would then apply to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.",

    "webTitle": "Osborne's focus on UK's deficit deters scrutiny of his weak economic plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite repeatedly missing his own targets, George Osborne has so far done well out of his decision to focus attention on the deficit. In keeping the spotlight on the public finances, the chancellor has avoided scrutiny of his broader economic strategy. The masterstroke was to convince the public that excessive spending by Labour caused the financial crisis. This was an impressive feat of persuasion: when the crisis began in 2007, public debt was lower as a share of GDP than when Labour took power a decade earlier. Despite finding little support in the facts, the story stuck, thanks in part to a media that failed to question Osborne\u2019s narrative. John McDonnell\u2019s announcement of Labour\u2019s fiscal rule is a admission that the Conservatives have succeeded in framing the economic debate. It is a tacit confession that Labour needs to improve its perceived lack of economic credibility. The rule commits a Labour government to balancing the budget over each parliamentary term, while exempting borrowing for investment. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the rule proposed by Ed Balls during the 2015 election campaign, a proposal derided at the time as \u201causterity lite\u2019\u201d by McDonnell. The difference is that he appears to be serious about embarking on a major public investment programme. It is unfortunate that a symbolic gesture of this kind is needed. The rule is being adopted for political reasons, not because the economics demands it. A balanced current budget is a reasonable aim, but is not something that a government can commit to. Budget deficits have a life of their own, as Osborne has discovered. But if the adoption of the rule helps Labour draw a line under the debate on the public finances and move on, it will have served its purpose. Discussion of deficits and austerity has been a diversion from the real issues. Successive governments have refused to put forward any serious economic strategy, choosing instead to invoke the power of the market. A programme of cuts to government spending \u2013 and middle-class taxes \u2013 is not a long-term economic plan. It is also failing even on its own terms: the latest figures show that national debt has is now rising as a share of GDP. The Conservatives are increasingly isolated in their refusal to engage in long-term economic thinking. Elsewhere, there is broad support for a renewal of industrial policy. It is clear that McDonell is committed to a more active role for government. In a rare cross-party statement, the former business secretaries Vince Cable and Chuka Umunna recently expressed their support for British industrial policy. Dan Jarvis, who is widely seen as a Jeremy Corbyn stalking horse, has spoken in favour of industrial strategy and the need to shift away from corporate short termism. Labour\u2019s factions should put aside their differences and work together to flesh out such a strategy. McDonnell\u2019s proposal has been well received, while Osborne\u2019s rule \u2013 and his agenda of fiscal austerity and redistribution from poor to rich \u2013 have been widely criticised by economists. McDonnell\u2019s rule should allow Labour to shift the terms of the debate towards more important matters. The list of issues requiring attention is sobering: flat productivity; lagging wages; an imbalanced economy reliant on imports, consumer credit and house price inflation; an ageing population \u2013 currently offset by immigration \u2013 and potential pressures on jobs from new forms of automation. Instead of debating whether greater investment expenditure is needed, this should be a given. The country can afford it. A more important task is outlining how the government can play an effective role in supporting and directing the economy. An obvious first step is to upgrade the UK\u2019s ageing infrastructure and begin working on reducing carbon emissions. But this will not be enough. The UK is fast becoming a post-industrial nation \u2013 a trend that receives little serious discussion. Britain needs to produce goods and services that the rest of the world wants to buy. What should industrial policy look like in a post-industrial society? It is time for Osborne\u2019s critics to move beyond the anti-austerity message and put forward a clear description of a modern economic strategy for the UK. To his credit, McDonnell has organised a series of events aimed at opening up debate on these issues. The state of the economy conference on Saturday provides an opportunity for the discussion to continue. Jo Michell is a senior lecturer in economics at the University of the West of England.",
