      "body": "<p>It has left a bitter taste that not even the strongest after-coffee mint could shift and the reputational crisis engulfing Starbucks over allegations of tax avoidance and removal of staff sick days could now see millions wiped from its balance sheet, academics have warned.</p> <p>Researchers from Manchester Business School have calculated that public anger at Starbucks' payment of just \u00a38.6m in UK tax over the past 13 years on sales of \u00a33.1bn and staff disbelief this week at being told paid lunch breaks, some sick leave and maternity benefits were being axed could result in a fall in sales of as much as 24% in the next year.</p> <p>The prediction, based on a study of the effect of reputation crises affecting more than 50 organisations, came as activists from the UK Uncut movement prepared to descend on around 40 of the US company's UK branches.</p> <p>The home of the gingerbread latte and caramel macchiatto will be targeted by protesters with a series of actions that illustrate how the coffee chain has become the focus for a series of political battles. Campaigners plan to turn Starbucks premises into temporary \"women's refuges\" as a comment on how government cuts, aggravated by corporate tax avoidance, are hitting women hardest.</p> <p>The protesters are unimpressed by Thursday's announcement that Starbucks is to pay \u00a310m in taxes over the next two years as it restructures its complex arrangements that have seen its UK operation pay no corporation tax in the past three years.</p> <p>\"Our research shows that if a company's reputation declines internally and externally at the same time, sales go down quickly,\" said Gary Davies, professor of corporate reputation at Manchester Business School.

      "bodyText": "It has left a bitter taste that not even the strongest after-coffee mint could shift and the reputational crisis engulfing Starbucks over allegations of tax avoidance and removal of staff sick days could now see millions wiped from its balance sheet, academics have warned. Researchers from Manchester Business School have calculated that public anger at Starbucks' payment of just \u00a38.6m in UK tax over the past 13 years on sales of \u00a33.1bn and staff disbelief this week at being told paid lunch breaks, some sick leave and maternity benefits were being axed could result in a fall in sales of as much as 24% in the next year. The prediction, based on a study of the effect of reputation crises affecting more than 50 organisations, came as activists from the UK Uncut movement prepared to descend on around 40 of the US company's UK branches. The home of the gingerbread latte and caramel macchiatto will be targeted by protesters with a series of actions that illustrate how the coffee chain has become the focus for a series of political battles. Campaigners plan to turn Starbucks premises into temporary \"women's refuges\" as a comment on how government cuts, aggravated by corporate tax avoidance, are hitting women hardest. The protesters are unimpressed by Thursday's announcement that Starbucks is to pay \u00a310m in taxes over the next two years as it restructures its complex arrangements that have seen its UK operation pay no corporation tax in the past three years. \"Our research shows that if a company's reputation declines internally and externally at the same time, sales go down quickly,\" said Gary Davies, professor of corporate reputation at Manchester Business School. He has studied the effects of reputational changes in 56 organisations. \"The danger for Starbucks is they will suffer an implosion of their reputation internally. The worst case scenario would be a decline of up to 24% in next year's sales.\" He said customers will discuss the tax and employment terms with staff and if they respond negatively consumer trust will be further eroded. The online retailer Amazon and web portal Google were branded alongside Starbucks as \"immoral\" this week by MPs for their tax practices, but it is the ubiquitous coffee chain that is the focus for protest. \"They are such a visible presence in our high streets where we are seeing the effects of cuts that you can't avoid the mismatch in what is going on,\" said Tim Street, a spokesman for UK Uncut. \"Starbucks is opening more and more branches and not paying their taxes while public services are being cut.\" After it was savaged over its tax payments by the influential public accounts committee, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, revealed he had been boycotting the chain over its tax bill and the business secretary, Vince Cable, voiced sympathy for anyone who did the same.

Austin Mitchell MP told him: \"You are either running the business very badly or there is some fiddle going on.\" No fiddle at all, insisted Starbucks, but when it finally indicated it would review its tax affairs, the committee chairman, Margaret Hodge MP, said bluntly: \"Starbucks has now caved in to public pressure and announced it will review the tax arrangements in the UK.

    "webTitle": "UK on triple-dip recession alert after industrial slowdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City has put the UK on triple-dip recession alert after news that falling factory and North Sea production have sent the output of industry plunging to its lowest level in 20 years. With the financial markets fearful that the final three months of 2012 will see the economy contract for the fourth quarter in the last five, David Cameron said manufacturers were short of skills and needed to learn lessons from Germany in order to develop a modern industrial workforce. The prime minister was speaking as the coalition's hopes of economic recovery received a setback from far weaker than expected official data from industry \u2013 the sector of the economy targeted for growth by the government. Amid signs that a collapse in demand from the crisis-stricken eurozone is affecting UK exporters, manufacturing production dropped 1.3% in October and was more than 2% down on a year earlier. Germany, the biggest economy in the single-currency area, reported that its manufacturing sector is also stuttering. Output from German factories dropped 2.4% in September. Financial markets were optimistic that UK industrial production, which includes oil and gas from the North Sea and energy supply as well as manufacturing, would post a healthy rise in October. But the Office for National Statistics reported an 0.8% drop in output to a level not seen since the recession of the early 1990s. North Sea production has fallen by almost 50% in the past three years and saw a fresh fall in October. Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said: \"The further drop in industrial production in October to its lowest level in two decades raises the chances of a triple dip recession in the wider economy. \"Even if October's fall in production is reversed over the next two months, the sector will knock about 0.3% off quarterly GDP growth. And we expect production to fall further in 2013 as the eurozone's recession deepens and high inflation holds back domestic consumer demand for manufactured goods.\" The gloomy news from industry came at the end of a run of poor economic data for services, construction and trade, leaving City economists questioning whether the UK economy would meet even the heavily scaled down forecasts for the economy presented by George Osborne in his autumn statement this week. The chancellor said he expected the economy to contract by 0.1% this year before growing by 1.2% in 2013, on the basis of evidence from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. He sought to boost industry with more generous investment allowances, higher infrastructure spending and a cut in corporation tax. To qualify as a triple dip recession, the economy would need to decline in the final three months of 2012 and the first three months of 2013. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citibank, said : \"Early data suggest the UK is heading for a 'treble dip', with GDP shrinking again in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect the economy will continue to underperform the OBR's forecasts in 2013-14, leading to further sizeable revenue shortfalls and deficit overshoots.\" Saunders said government debt as a share of national output was likely to hit 100% over the coming years as budget deficits piled up in response to weak growth. \"We have argued for a while that the UK will lose its AAA rating in the next two to three years and it now seems likely that this will happen in the next 12-18 months, reflecting the higher path for the debt/GDP ratio plus rising uncertainty over how and whether the government will achieve the savings needed to stabilise and reverse the debt trajectory.\" A leading thinktank, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said growth had slowed sharply since the 1% growth in the third quarter of 2012 that marked the end of the nine-month double dip recession. It estimated growth of 0.1% in the three months to November and said the economy would not be strong enough in 2013 to reduce unemployment. The prime minister, on a visit to the West Midlands, said the competitiveness of industry was being hampered by a skills deficit. Cameron urged schools, colleges and businesses to take a \"more Germanic approach\" by consulting on what skills were most needed in the next generation of workers. \"We need frankly to have a more Germanic approach to that skills deficit. I think we will crack it, but it will take time.\" The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said the chancellor was wrong to say that Britain was on the mend. \"Osborne says the economy is healing but yesterday we learnt the trade deficit has grown, today that manufacturing fell by 2.1% on the year. The increasing trade deficit and fall in manufacturing again underlines the need for the implementation of a proper industrial strategy\" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The decline in manufacturing was much larger than expected. The wider industrial production figures were also bleak, with a decline of 0.8% instead of the increase that was anticipated. The new data increases the risk that GDP will record a decline in the fourth quarter of the year. In our recent forecast, we predicted that manufacturing output would see a decline of 1.1% in 2012 as a whole. However unless there is significant rebound in the final two months of the year, the fall could be even larger.\"",

We expect the economy will continue to underperform the OBR's forecasts in 2013-14, leading to further sizeable revenue shortfalls and deficit overshoots.\"</p> <p>Saunders said government debt as a share of national output was likely to hit 100% over the coming years as budget deficits piled up in response to weak growth. \"We have argued for a while that the UK will lose its AAA rating in the next two to three years and it now seems likely that this will happen in the next 12-18 months, reflecting the higher path for the debt/GDP ratio plus rising uncertainty over how and whether the government will achieve the savings needed to stabilise and reverse the debt trajectory.\"</p> <p>A leading thinktank, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said growth had slowed sharply since the 1% growth in the third quarter of 2012 that marked the end of the nine-month double dip recession. It estimated growth of 0.1% in the three months to November and said the economy would not be strong enough in 2013 to reduce unemployment.</p> <p>The prime minister, on a visit to the West Midlands, said the competitiveness of industry was being hampered by a skills deficit. Cameron urged schools, colleges and businesses to take a \"more Germanic approach\" by consulting on what skills were most needed in the next generation of workers. \"We need frankly to have a more Germanic approach to that skills deficit. I think we will crack it, but it will take time.\"</p> <p>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said the chancellor was wrong to say that Britain was on the mend. \"Osborne says the economy is healing but yesterday we learnt the trade deficit has grown, today that manufacturing fell by 2.1% on the year. The increasing trade deficit and fall in manufacturing again underlines the need for the implementation of a proper industrial strategy\"</p> <p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The decline in manufacturing was much larger than expected. The wider industrial production figures were also bleak, with a decline of 0.8% instead of the increase that was anticipated. The new data increases the risk that GDP will record a decline in the fourth quarter of the year. In our recent forecast, we predicted that manufacturing output would see a decline of 1.1% in 2012 as a whole. However unless there is significant rebound in the final two months of the year, the fall could be even larger.\"</p>",

The delay puts the nuclear renaissance at the heart of the UK government's energy plans into further doubt after a difficult week in which EDF was hit by cost overruns and the exit of its partner from a key French project. The new reactors at Hinkley were to be the first of a new generation of atomic plants in the UK and EDF had repeatedly pledged to make a final investment decision by the end of 2012. But the decision to plough billions of pounds into the project is now unlikely to be taken before April 2013, according to sources close to the project, although EDF declined to comment. \"This is another broken promise from EDF on a policy that has always been failing,\" said Tom Burke, the founding director of the green thinktank E3G. \"To spend at least \u00a314bn on a pair of reactors at Hinkley is very, very high risk.\" The latest projections from the Department of Energy and Climate Change have reduced the amount of nuclear power expected in future, with only Hinkley expected to be up and running by 2025, he added.

      "bodyText": "Banks are braced for a wave of fines and other penalties for breaching money laundering rules, busting sanctions and attempting to manipulate Libor over the coming two weeks. Regulators in the US and UK are expected to announce a series of expensive and potentially explosive actions against banks including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland. With Standard Chartered admitting it expects to hand over a total of $670m (\u00a3415m) to US regulators \"very soon\" and HSBC preparing the ground for fines of at least \u00a3900m for offences in the US, several other banks are also preparing to be hit by a wave of multimillion-pound penalties. RBS is thought to be braced for the possibility that its fine for Libor rigging could come before Christmas. Stephen Hester, chief executive of the bailed out bank, has made clear he hopes to have settled the issue before the bank reports its results in February. Hester said last month that the bank was preparing to enter talks to settle Libor-rigging claims and that it will be a \"miserable day in RBS's history\". An RBS spokesman declined to comment further. Speculation is also rife that Swiss bank UBS is in talks to settle allegations that its traders, including ones in London, were attempting to manipulate Libor, and there are reports that the fine could exceed the \u00a3290m record fine slapped on Barclays in June. The FSA's portion of that fine was a record \u00a359.5m and it has said that it is investigating seven other financial institutions \u2013 not just banks \u2013 for attempting to manipulate the benchmark rate. So far action has only been taken against Barclays, which lost its chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond and newly promoted chief operating officer Jerry del Missier in the fallout. During a trading update this week, Standard Chartered's finance director, Richard Meddings, admitted he expected a settlement \"very soon\" with US regulators over accusations the bank schemed to hide $250bn from the authorities for nearly a decade. The bank has settled with New York's department of financial services (DFS), paying $340m over claims the financial system was left vulnerable to \"terrorists\" and \"drug king pins\" and expects the remaining regulators to slap it with a bill of $330m to settle the claims. HSBC has set aside \u00a3940m to settle allegations by the US Senate that it laundered money through the US for drug barons in Mexico and conceded that costs could be higher and it could face criminal and civil charges. Ratings agency Fitch on Friday downgraded the bank to AA minus from AA, citing a number of factors including the \"legal fees, provisions for litigation and customer redress, expenses to ensure consistent adherence to compliance and governance standards as well as business conduct and most importantly, complying with numerous and higher regulatory requirements\". The Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England included potential losses from fines and compensation linked to mis-selling scandals on its worry list of problems facing the sector. The potential cost of mis-selling was put at up to \u00a310bn with forbearance \u2013 where banks offer the customers leniency on the loans \u2013 put at \u00a315bn and quirks in the way international rules allow banks to set aside capital potentially costing \u00a335bn. Another issue facing the banks is a decision from the Financial Services Authority about the way they are deciding how to compensate small business customers who believe they were mis-sold interest rates swaps intended to protect them against interest rate rises. A series of test cases are being reviewed and a decision could come shortly \u2013 kickstarting a potential wave of compensation payments that could run to hundreds of millions of pounds for the big four banks.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Economists and journalists have been combing the data beyond the headline figures to find the best insight and analysis", 
      "body": "<p>Economic data can seem boring and soulless. But on the first Friday of every month, it becomes a nerdy and active game on Twitter, as pundits, economists and journalists all comb the unemployment numbers, competing to find the best insight or analysis. Their conversations every month turn the otherwise cold and bloodless business of reading numbers into something like a Sherlock Holmes mystery: what killed employment this month? Was the murder weapon hidden in construction, in manufacturing or in some other sector?</p> <p>The challenge started anew on Friday with jobs numbers that held two crucial mysteries: now that the election is over, can we finally tell \u2013 without a lot of political yelling \u2013 how the economy is doing?; and what was the effect of Hurricane Sandy, which caused over $80bn of damage to New York and New Jersey?</p> <p>For those who don't follow the economics conversation on Twitter, it's a good time to start now that the election is over and the attendant political freakouts are largely quieted.</p> <p>In fact, for those who have tuned out the economic debate, it's finally possible to suddenly start getting absorbed in the otherwise grim business of learning about the economy by combing Twitter. It's helpful to have the context provided by people who notice details so easily and casually that would otherwise pass into the noisy ephemera of social media.</p> <p>The Twitter analysis usually has a rhythm. For instance, there is usually a tweeter who immediately sums up the report in less than 140 characters. Today, that person was Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Jobs report says we added 146k jobs in November, unemployment fell to 7.7. Contrary to expectations, BLS says Sandy didn't much matter.</p> <p>\u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/277050596081692673\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-07T14:03:04+00:00\">December 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>That's easy to understand: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reported an addition of 146,000 jobs for the month, bringing the jobless rate down to 7.7%, from 7.9% last month. But the BLS offered an analysis that suggested that Hurricane Sandy wasn't a big factor. That doesn't fit with this week's other unemployment report, the private payrolls reported by ADP and analyzed by Moody's. The ADP numbers suggested that Hurricane Sandy did in fact hit the economy.</p> <p>So the stage is set, with tweeters donning their deerstalker caps and pulling out their magnifiying glasses. They start to examine the evidence.</p> <p>First, there's usually a warning to (and from) the wise not to put total faith in the official unemployment numbers. The math is far from exact, because the BLS uses a survey, and sometimes that survey doesn't cover everything that is happening in the economy. As a result, the first BLS unemployment numbers are often subject to mistakes. They have a large margin of error \u2013 they could be wrong by 100,000 jobs! \u2013 and the numbers usually get revised not once, but twice.</p> <p>That's what happened this month \u2013 the numbers for the previous two months were revised downward. We added 50,000 fewer jobs to the economy than we thought. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan, issued the best warning to chill out.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Downward revisions of nearly 50K are a reminder of how volatile these estimates are.</p> <p>\u2014 Betsey Stevenson (@BetseyStevenson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetseyStevenson/status/277043900613550081\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-07T13:36:27+00:00\">December 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Then the analysis of the actual numbers starts. This is often the best part. The blog ZeroHedge, which takes a severely skeptical view of employment statistics, pointed out one of the worst pieces of data from the unemployment report: the number of unemployed is falling because people are completely dropping out of the labor force, so they're not even being counted any more. Dow Jones reporter Jeffrey Sparshott noticed the same. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>People out of labor force rises by 540K from 88,341 to 88,883</p> <p>\u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/277044265262120960\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-07T13:37:54+00:00\">December 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>US unemployment rate lowest since Dec 2008, but largely a reflection of people dropping out of workforce</p> <p>\u2014 Jeffrey Sparshott (@jeffatdowjones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffatdowjones/status/277043161916919808\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-07T13:33:31+00:00\">December 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>There are strange and interesting trends \u2013 for instance, that the number of people who found jobs was not so far from the number of people who lost jobs. This sheds a light on one of the biggest problems in the nationwide unemployment crisis: we're barely getting ahead in adding jobs without also losing others. </p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>2.2 million unemployed workers (17.5% of total) found jobs in November. Meanwhile 1.9mm employed workers became unemployed.</p> <p>\u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/277053211490258945\" data-datetime=\"2012-12-07T14:13:27+00:00\">December 7, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>It helps to have context on where we are in the unemployment crisis.

      "bodyText": "Economic data can seem boring and soulless. But on the first Friday of every month, it becomes a nerdy and active game on Twitter, as pundits, economists and journalists all comb the unemployment numbers, competing to find the best insight or analysis. Their conversations every month turn the otherwise cold and bloodless business of reading numbers into something like a Sherlock Holmes mystery: what killed employment this month? Was the murder weapon hidden in construction, in manufacturing or in some other sector? The challenge started anew on Friday with jobs numbers that held two crucial mysteries: now that the election is over, can we finally tell \u2013 without a lot of political yelling \u2013 how the economy is doing?; and what was the effect of Hurricane Sandy, which caused over $80bn of damage to New York and New Jersey? For those who don't follow the economics conversation on Twitter, it's a good time to start now that the election is over and the attendant political freakouts are largely quieted. In fact, for those who have tuned out the economic debate, it's finally possible to suddenly start getting absorbed in the otherwise grim business of learning about the economy by combing Twitter. It's helpful to have the context provided by people who notice details so easily and casually that would otherwise pass into the noisy ephemera of social media. The Twitter analysis usually has a rhythm. For instance, there is usually a tweeter who immediately sums up the report in less than 140 characters. Today, that person was Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein. Jobs report says we added 146k jobs in November, unemployment fell to 7.7. Contrary to expectations, BLS says Sandy didn't much matter. \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) December 7, 2012 That's easy to understand: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reported an addition of 146,000 jobs for the month, bringing the jobless rate down to 7.7%, from 7.9% last month. But the BLS offered an analysis that suggested that Hurricane Sandy wasn't a big factor. That doesn't fit with this week's other unemployment report, the private payrolls reported by ADP and analyzed by Moody's. The ADP numbers suggested that Hurricane Sandy did in fact hit the economy. So the stage is set, with tweeters donning their deerstalker caps and pulling out their magnifiying glasses. They start to examine the evidence. First, there's usually a warning to (and from) the wise not to put total faith in the official unemployment numbers. The math is far from exact, because the BLS uses a survey, and sometimes that survey doesn't cover everything that is happening in the economy. As a result, the first BLS unemployment numbers are often subject to mistakes. They have a large margin of error \u2013 they could be wrong by 100,000 jobs! \u2013 and the numbers usually get revised not once, but twice. That's what happened this month \u2013 the numbers for the previous two months were revised downward. We added 50,000 fewer jobs to the economy than we thought. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan, issued the best warning to chill out. Downward revisions of nearly 50K are a reminder of how volatile these estimates are. \u2014 Betsey Stevenson (@BetseyStevenson) December 7, 2012 Then the analysis of the actual numbers starts. This is often the best part. The blog ZeroHedge, which takes a severely skeptical view of employment statistics, pointed out one of the worst pieces of data from the unemployment report: the number of unemployed is falling because people are completely dropping out of the labor force, so they're not even being counted any more. Dow Jones reporter Jeffrey Sparshott noticed the same. People out of labor force rises by 540K from 88,341 to 88,883 \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 7, 2012 US unemployment rate lowest since Dec 2008, but largely a reflection of people dropping out of workforce \u2014 Jeffrey Sparshott (@jeffatdowjones) December 7, 2012 There are strange and interesting trends \u2013 for instance, that the number of people who found jobs was not so far from the number of people who lost jobs. This sheds a light on one of the biggest problems in the nationwide unemployment crisis: we're barely getting ahead in adding jobs without also losing others. 2.2 million unemployed workers (17.5% of total) found jobs in November. Meanwhile 1.9mm employed workers became unemployed. \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 7, 2012 It helps to have context on where we are in the unemployment crisis. Many people pointed out that the jobless rate now is lower than any time since December 2008, when Lehman Brothers fell and the economy started to collapse. Eddy Elfenbein noticed that we've only gotten halfway towards adding enough jobs to equal the ones lost during the recessionary times: From Jan 2008 peak to Feb 2010 trough we lost 8.959 million jobs. We've made back 4.608 million or 51%. \u2014 Eddy Elfenbein (@EddyElfenbein) December 7, 2012 Sudeep Reddy, on the Wall Street Journal's economics team, pointed out how long the road is ahead.

On top of that, Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on M&amp;S from neutral to sell, saying the retailer's strategy of continuing to invest in its capital-intensive stores as well as building up its online offering would do little for its profit margins in the medium term. Analyst Rob Joyce said:</p> <blockquote> In our view, management's decision to step up multichannel capital expenditure makes sense, but the late commitment to the model, combined with a long-term commitment to a large freehold/long leasehold store base means that the shift to online sales will not be margin accretive in our forecast period [to 2015]. </blockquote> <p>Goldman said there were risks that M&amp;S could do better than the bank expected, including \"stronger-than-expected growth in UK consumer confidence, and M&amp;A activity. A further risk is that the capital investments being made translate into profitability growth earlier than we forecast.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S fell 4.2p to 393.6p after the downgrade while <strong>Next</strong> dropped 8p to \u00a337.04 despite Goldman raising its rating:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade Next to neutral [from sell] given its strong industry positioning and cash return on capital invested, driven by the growth of its profitable, capital-light, online business. </blockquote> <p>Overall, leading shares ended the week on a positive note, following better than expected US non-farm payroll figures. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished up 12.98 points at 5914.40, up nearly 50 points on the week despite eurozone and German growth forecasts being cut by the European Central Bank and Bundesbank respectively, and a bleak UK autumn statement announcement from chancellor George Osborne. Investors were also nervous about Greece's proposed bond buying programme - vital for its next tranche of bailout money - and growing political problems in Italy, not to mention the continuing US budget talks.</p> <p>British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> climbed 5.4p to 337p after a buy recommendation from UBS, which said the company had the strongest balance sheet of all the major European utilities:</p> <blockquote> With strong ongoing cashflow generation UBS forecast Centrica to have balance sheet headroom of \u00a31.2bn in 2013, \u00a32.8bn in 2014, and \u00a34.1bn in 2015. This strength gives Centrica the attractive options of earnings accretive acquisitions, organic investment, and/or quite possibly a redistribution (likely a \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m 2013 buyback) should they not proceed with new nuclear. </blockquote> <p><strong>Whitbread</strong> - which issues a trading update next week - rose 20p to \u00a324.28 on hopes that its Costa Coffee business would benefit from any consumer boycot of Starbucks over the tax controversy surrounding the US-owned group. Patrick Coffey at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Comments [from Starbuck's UK boss] would suggest that consumers in the UK are, and may continue, to trade away from Starbucks in the short term. This is positive for Whitbread's Costa brand (a fully signed up UK tax contributor). We continue to believe consensus has not factored in the growth of Costa and believe the company will upgrade their 2011 strategic targets by over 60% next year. We remain at the top of the range and are happy to be there. Meanwhile, protests at Starbucks stores are planned tomorrow by campaign group UK Uncut which will give further press coverage to Starbucks' ongoing image problems. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Xstrata</strong> edged 6.5p lower to \u00a310.35 on concerns its long drawn out merger with <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 0.5p to 345.2p could still be derailed by local regulators. South African utility Eskom has expressed concerns the deal could threaten its coal supplies while the mineworkers' union is worried about job cuts. Richard Knights at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> [It is] unlikely that deal will be blocked, rather that the government will be looking for assurances that nothing drastic change will come of the merger. </blockquote> <p><strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> slipped back despite the group unveiling a pensions deal with <strong>Legal and General</strong>. The sweeteners and starches group has hedged some 43% of its total pension liabilities, with a \u00a3347m transfer of assets and cash from its scheme to L&amp;G. This effectively buys a bulk annuity policy with L&amp;G paying the necessary amount of benefits to the pension trustees.</p> <p>With Tate also hosting a visit to its US operations, the company's shares dipped 2p to 759p while L&amp;G added 1.1p to 147p.</p> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Berkeley</strong> signalled its confidence in the market by paying its first dividend since 2008 - giving chairman and major shareholder Tony Pidgley a near \u00a3900,000 boost - while <strong>Bellway</strong> was also positive.</p> <p>Berkeley, which concentrates on London and the south east, reported a 40.7% rise in half year profits to \u00a3142.2m. It will pay an interim dividend of 15p a share ahead of a larger capital return planned for 2015, news which pushed its shares up 78p to \u00a317.28.</p> <p>Meanwhile Bellway, up 1p to \u00a310.05, said market conditions remained largely unchanged, but customers's ability to access mortgage finance had improved slightly as a result of the government's NewBuy indemnity scheme.</p> <p>Finally, <strong>Apple</strong> investors had a rocky ride this week, with the iPad company's shares losing more than 6% on Wednesday - wiping $35bn off its value - with traders struggling to explain the fall. The reasons they came up with included Apple facing increased competition in China, losing market share in tablets, and fund managers taking profits ahead of proposed US capital gains tax increases next year.</p> <p>The company recovered some of its losses on Thursday after a series of interviews by chief executive Tim Cook, but on Friday it fell again, down 1.5% in early trading.</p>",

On top of that, Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on M&amp;S from neutral to sell, saying the retailer's strategy of continuing to invest in its capital-intensive stores as well as building up its online offering would do little for its profit margins in the medium term. Analyst Rob Joyce said: In our view, management's decision to step up multichannel capital expenditure makes sense, but the late commitment to the model, combined with a long-term commitment to a large freehold/long leasehold store base means that the shift to online sales will not be margin accretive in our forecast period [to 2015]. Goldman said there were risks that M&amp;S could do better than the bank expected, including \"stronger-than-expected growth in UK consumer confidence, and M&amp;A activity. A further risk is that the capital investments being made translate into profitability growth earlier than we forecast.\" M&amp;S fell 4.2p to 393.6p after the downgrade while Next dropped 8p to \u00a337.04 despite Goldman raising its rating: We upgrade Next to neutral [from sell] given its strong industry positioning and cash return on capital invested, driven by the growth of its profitable, capital-light, online business. Overall, leading shares ended the week on a positive note, following better than expected US non-farm payroll figures. The FTSE 100 finished up 12.98 points at 5914.40, up nearly 50 points on the week despite eurozone and German growth forecasts being cut by the European Central Bank and Bundesbank respectively, and a bleak UK autumn statement announcement from chancellor George Osborne. Investors were also nervous about Greece's proposed bond buying programme - vital for its next tranche of bailout money - and growing political problems in Italy, not to mention the continuing US budget talks. British Gas owner Centrica climbed 5.4p to 337p after a buy recommendation from UBS, which said the company had the strongest balance sheet of all the major European utilities: With strong ongoing cashflow generation UBS forecast Centrica to have balance sheet headroom of \u00a31.2bn in 2013, \u00a32.8bn in 2014, and \u00a34.1bn in 2015. This strength gives Centrica the attractive options of earnings accretive acquisitions, organic investment, and/or quite possibly a redistribution (likely a \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m 2013 buyback) should they not proceed with new nuclear. Whitbread - which issues a trading update next week - rose 20p to \u00a324.28 on hopes that its Costa Coffee business would benefit from any consumer boycot of Starbucks over the tax controversy surrounding the US-owned group. Patrick Coffey at Liberum Capital said: Comments [from Starbuck's UK boss] would suggest that consumers in the UK are, and may continue, to trade away from Starbucks in the short term. This is positive for Whitbread's Costa brand (a fully signed up UK tax contributor). We continue to believe consensus has not factored in the growth of Costa and believe the company will upgrade their 2011 strategic targets by over 60% next year. We remain at the top of the range and are happy to be there. Meanwhile, protests at Starbucks stores are planned tomorrow by campaign group UK Uncut which will give further press coverage to Starbucks' ongoing image problems. But Xstrata edged 6.5p lower to \u00a310.35 on concerns its long drawn out merger with Glencore, down 0.5p to 345.2p could still be derailed by local regulators. South African utility Eskom has expressed concerns the deal could threaten its coal supplies while the mineworkers' union is worried about job cuts. Richard Knights at Liberum Capital said: [It is] unlikely that deal will be blocked, rather that the government will be looking for assurances that nothing drastic change will come of the merger. Tate and Lyle slipped back despite the group unveiling a pensions deal with Legal and General. The sweeteners and starches group has hedged some 43% of its total pension liabilities, with a \u00a3347m transfer of assets and cash from its scheme to L&amp;G. This effectively buys a bulk annuity policy with L&amp;G paying the necessary amount of benefits to the pension trustees. With Tate also hosting a visit to its US operations, the company's shares dipped 2p to 759p while L&amp;G added 1.1p to 147p. Housebuilder Berkeley signalled its confidence in the market by paying its first dividend since 2008 - giving chairman and major shareholder Tony Pidgley a near \u00a3900,000 boost - while Bellway was also positive. Berkeley, which concentrates on London and the south east, reported a 40.7% rise in half year profits to \u00a3142.2m. It will pay an interim dividend of 15p a share ahead of a larger capital return planned for 2015, news which pushed its shares up 78p to \u00a317.28. Meanwhile Bellway, up 1p to \u00a310.05, said market conditions remained largely unchanged, but customers's ability to access mortgage finance had improved slightly as a result of the government's NewBuy indemnity scheme. Finally, Apple investors had a rocky ride this week, with the iPad company's shares losing more than 6% on Wednesday - wiping $35bn off its value - with traders struggling to explain the fall. The reasons they came up with included Apple facing increased competition in China, losing market share in tablets, and fund managers taking profits ahead of proposed US capital gains tax increases next year. The company recovered some of its losses on Thursday after a series of interviews by chief executive Tim Cook, but on Friday it fell again, down 1.5% in early trading.",

Helena Smith writes: Alpha TV is reporting that foreign participation in the buy-back scheme has been \"very satisfactory\". Bitu finance ministry officials are refusing to confirm whether the scheme has actually closed on deadline at 5pm. \"The Public Debt Organisation will issue an announcement. I don't want to know!\" said one. Details of the success or otherwise of the scheme are expected next week. So on that note, it's time to close the blog for the week. Thanks for the comments and we'll be back once more on Monday. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has said it could cut Italy's BBB+ rating if the recession continues into the second half of 2013, according to Reuters. S&amp;P says there is a significant risk Italy's GDP will not recover in that period and will continue to contract. Its negative outlook also reflects uncertainty over whether the next government would stick to the reform agenda implemented by Mario Monti. European markets have closed, and it was a fairly mixed performance. The Bundesbank cutting its German growth forecasts, uncertainty over the Greek bond buyback and concerns about the political situation in Italy have all combined to make a nervous end to the week. On the other hand, better than expected US non-farm payroll figures have provided a measure of support. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 12.98 points higher at 5914.40, up 0.22% \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.22% \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.11% \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.79% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB was down 0.86% \u2022 The Athens market rose 1.09% \u2022 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.34% Yields on Spanish and Italian ten-year bonds eased lower, while the euro is currently down around 0.2% at $1.2941. Attica Bank is the latest to participate in the Greek buyback, ahead of the 5pm deadline, according to journalist Efthimia Efthimiou. But should this be a surprise? Employees of the Greek Social Security Foundation have been holding an anti-austerity protest outside the Labour Ministry in Athens today - here's a photo: Two more Greek banks have decided to take part in the bond buyback scheme, reports Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou. Here's more on the Greek bond swap, from Helena Smith in Athens (following on from her 3.20pm post) Well-briefed officials at the finance ministry are reiterating that the debt buy back will close, as originally foreseen, at 5pm GMT irrespective of banks\u2019 tardiness in deciding to participate in the operation. \u201cWe have been very clear about this from the onset,\u201d said one. \u201cHow much clearer can we be?\u201d But officials are also finding it hard to hide their frustration with the reaction of investors to the scheme [for which read banks] given that Greece\u2019s next disbursement of aid depends exclusively on its outcome. \u201cWe will see, we will see,\u201d I was told in response to repeated questions over whether the deadline would be extended. Whatever the result, there are few who believe the deal will do anything to effectively make Greece\u2019s mammoth debt anywhere near viable. And as such, say Greece\u2019s increasingly confident main opposition Syriza party, the success of the scheme is irrelevant. Helena explains: \u201cIt won\u2019t be successful in relieving Greece of its debt problems,\u201d said Takis Pavlopoulos, a senior aide to Alexis Tsipras, the radical left party\u2019s charismatic leader. \u201cIt does not ensure the viability of Greece\u2019s debt. To do that we need a proper haircut with a change in policy which means ending austerity.\" Regular readers will recall that under their latest rescue programme, Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF aim to bring down the country\u2019s debt load to 124% of GDP by 2020 but Syriza says that will be an impossible task when austerity-induced recession has resulted, constantly, in fiscal targets being missed. Over in Greece, finance minister Yannis Stournaras has spoken to the press about the debt buyback scheme. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that the media interest was intense. The countdown to tonight\u2019s bond buy back deadline is being awaited anxiously. Reporters literally lunged at the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras when he emerged a few minutes ago from holding talks with the coalition government\u2019s party leaders at prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 office. When asked if he had any news about the scheme\u2019s progress, the economics professor elected to keep his cards close to his chest. \u201cI have no picture yet,\u201d he said. There are also reports that the results of the deal may not be released until next week: Just in \u2013 Greece's National Bank has announced it will take part in the country's debt buyback, after a board meeting. That makes National Bank the first of Greece's financial institutions to declare its support for the scheme, which closes in two hours ... Our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, says today's US jobs data suggests the US economy has shrugged off effect of hurricane Sandy. However, economists fear that the looming US fiscal cliff is affecting teh labour market. David Semmens, a senior US economist... said companies were making the hires that they needed, but that it was clear hiring was far slower than it would be if the fiscal cliff were resolved. \"Companies are hiring people that they have to hire, but they are behind in the cycle. I would expect this number to be far better if and when there is a resolution,\" he said. Here's Dominic's full story: US unemployment rate falls to 7.7% as economy adds 146,000 jobs The weakening European economy has hit workers at a Fiat plant in Poland. The company has just announced that it will lay off 1,500 people due to falling demand for cars in Europe. The cuts will hit a factory in Tych which has a total workforce of around 5,600. It's the latest in a series of bad news about the European car industry, with General Motors' expecting losses of up to $1.8bn from the region, and Daimler issuing a profits warning. The latest US employment data has just been released, and it's better than expected. A total of 146,000 new jobs were created in November, beating the estimate of 93,000. This has pulled down the US unemployment rate to 7.7%. However, October's data was revised downwards, from the original blowout estimate of 171,000 to 138,000, and September's non-farm payroll was also trimmed a little (from 148,000 to 132,000). The labour-force participation rate fell, though, to 63.6% - the lowest since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That suggests more Americans simply gave up looking for work. Still, the markets like the look of it -- the FTSE 100 has now turned positive (up 13 points). The euro has kept falling this morning, and just dropped below $1.29 for the first time this week. The trigger is a report on Bloomberg that \"a majority\" of ECB policymakers favour cutting interest rates (having held them at yesterday's meeting). Kit Juckes, strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, says today's German (11.15am) and UK (9.42am) industrial output data are \"awful\". But he takes some solace from yesterday's better-than-expected German industrial orders (IFO), and produces a chart suggesting that there could be a bounceback coming; Greek banks were holding meetings this morning to discuss whether to take part in today's debt buyback, and there are now reports on the wires that they will take part: Greek bondholders have under five hours to decide whether to accept Athens' offer to buy back its debt for up to 40% of its face value. The bond buyback scheme is meant to help Greece cut its debt mountain, and unlock more loans from the IMF. However, it's not clear yet how many investors have taken up the offer. A finance ministry insider told Reuters this morning that the offer would not be extended - which might be designed to encourage waverers to take the money. It's a tricky decision. If Greece recovers then its bonds could be worth more than the offer on the table today. But if conditions worsen, Greece could default again. The FT's Robin Wigglesworth has written a good explanation, and concludes that investors could be wise to sign up: Greece\u2019s debts will be towering even after a buyback, and the official sector is likely to be forced into forgiving some of its loans eventually. Yet paymaster Germany may well seek to wipe out private sector creditors in the process. Carsten Brzeski of ING says the drop in German industrial output (see 11.15am) shows Europe's \"backbone\" is weakening and heading into a contraction (as the Bundesbank also warned this morning). Brzeski writes: The German decoupling from the rest of the Eurozone has come to an end. Strong trading ties with non-Eurozone countries had shielded the economy against the euro crisis. Now, with the global economic cooling in the second half of the year, this immunity is quickly fading away. The thinning out of order books throughout the year is finally feeding through to the real economy. Another blow to the German economy \u2013 industrial output fell 2.6% in October, from September, according to data just released by the economy ministry. Construction (down 5.3%) and capital goods (basically large equipment; down 4.3%) were the biggest fallers. In a statement, the ministry said expected 'subdued' output in the last three months of 2012. Economist had only expected a 0.5% drop in output. The sharp fall is particularly surprising as yesterday we learned that factory orders posted strong gains in October (as DemocratCH pointed out in the comments below). Here's a breakdown of the data (seasonally adjusted) Intermediate goods: -1.1% Capital goods: -4.3% Consumer goods: 0.9% (durables -6.2%, non-durables +0.1%) Energy: - 3.2% Construction: - 5.3% The financial markets have shrugged off this morning's bad news triple-whammy, with the main indices pretty flat. The FTSE 100 is down a lackluster 4 points (Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, compares it to \"those traders struggling to shake off the excesses of the previous night\".) Matt Basi, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, explained that investors are calm because they anticipate further stimulus moves from the central banks: Reaction to the news \u2013 whilst predictably negative \u2013 has been notably calm, as traders take the view that policy makers will now be forced to pump liquidity into the markets short term. The euro is still down, at $1.293 vs the US dollar. On the demise of FT Deutschland (see also 8.45am), the paper's chief economist, Thomas Fricke, has pinned the blame on Angela Merkel. If only she'd listened to us..... The political turmoil in Italy continues today, after yesterday's drama (in which Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s backers abstained from key parliamentary votes, technically leaving Mario Monti without a majority). From Rome, Tom Kington reports: All eyes are the meeting this morning between Angelino Alfano, Berlusconi\u2019s party secretary, and Italian president Giorgio Napolitano, who has the power to dissolve parliament and call elections if he decides Monti\u2019s time is up. Alfano meanwhile confirmed that Berlusconi has definitely thrown his hat back in the ring. Prime minister Mario Monti has said he awaits instructions from Napolitano. Napolitano has already tried to calm the waters and Alfano has said yesterday\u2019s walk out from parliament was a sign of disapproval of Monti\u2019s handling of the economy rather than a bid to pull the plug. He also denied that it had anything to do with the cabinet\u2019s issuing of a decree yesterday which will exclude from parliament politicians with certain criminal convictions, a measure that could affect Berlusconi as he plans an appeal against his conviction in October for tax fraud. Another view is that Berlusconi wants to pressure Monti into bringing forward national elections planned for March to coincide with key regional elections in Lazio and Lombardy currently planned to be held in February. In both regions, the authorities hitherto run by Berlusconi backers collapsed because of corruption scandals. Should Berlusconi take a drubbing in these regional elections, the fear is it could rebound on his chances in the national election if it is held shortly after. And the negative reaction of the markets to Berlusconi\u2019s sabre rattling? His former culture minister Sandro Bondi dismissed it as \u201cthe little games of the markets,\u201d adding \u201cthe real situation of this country is not revealed by the spread, but by the desperation of citizens.\" Economists are very alarmed by this morning's weak UK manufacturing data (see 9.42am), using words like \"shocking\" and \"dire\". It suggests Britain's economy is shrinking again: David Tinsley of BNP Paribas: The latest release was shockingly bad. Some of the weakness today is likely to reflect partly erratic, reflecting in part an unwind in the food sector from Olympic-related activity (beer sales are sharply lower). ...But overall this is very bad news at the start of the fourth quarter. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight This is a dire set of data. While it has been evident that the manufacturing sector is finding life very tough at the moment, the 1.3% drop in output in October is far worse than expected and very worrying... It is only too apparent that manufactures are facing a tough environment..... Particular weakness was reported in alcohol output in October, but I think we all need a pretty stiff drink after this data, so that may provide a near-term boost to output in that sector Please give generously... More gloom - this time in the UK, where the latest factory production data is much worse than forecast. Manufacturing output fell by 1.3% in October compared with September, much weaker than the forecast of a 0.2% decline. Among industrial firms output fell by 0.8%, against predictions of a month-on-month rise of 0.7%. Economists and City traders aren't impressed: Breaking: The Austrian central bank has also just issued new GDP forecasts, and like the Bundesbank it has slashed its predictions. The Austrian National Bank forecasts growth of just 0.5% next year, agreeing with the Bundesbank that 2013 will be difficult. Here are the new forecasts: 2012: +0.4% (down from 0.9% previously) 2013: +0.5% (down from 1.7% ) 2014: 1.7% (down from 2.1%) And here's economist Frederik Ducrozet's first take on the Bundesbank's new forecasts: The Bundesbank has also warned that German unemployment will be higher than previously forecast. Here's a round-up of the latest Bundesbank forecasts Unemployment 2012: 6.8% (vs 6.7% previously) 2013: 7.5% (vs 6.5% ) 2014: 7.0% Inflation: 2012: 2.1% 2013: 1.5% (vs 1.6%) GDP: 2012: + 0.7% (vs 1% previously) 2013: + 0.4% (vs 1.6%) Speaking of German gloom, it lost a newspaper today with the closure of Financial Times Deutschland. Their front page doesn't underplay the moment... As well as being bad for Germany, the Bundesbank's new forecasts (see 7.53am) have worrying implications for other countries. For example, Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecasts are for UK GDP to increase by 1.2% in 2013 \u2013 this morning's forecasts imply the German economy would grow just a third as fast. The Bundesbank's gloomier warnings could prompt Germany to do more to solve the euro crisis, or it could make Berlin politicians more wary of extra financial commitments, suggests Re-Define's Sony Kapoor. The euro started falling as soon as the Bundesbank's new forecasts hit the wires. It's down 0.3 of a US cent at $1.293. It's also lost ground against sterling, with one pound up 0.2% at \u20ac1.24. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis and other events in the world economy. We start with some breaking news: The Bundesbank has cut its growth forecasts for the German economy, warning that the financial crisis will have a much greater impact on Europe's largest economy. Next year looks particularly weak, with Germany at some risk of falling into recession in the months ahead. The Bundesbank expects growth of 0.7% this year, down from 1%. In 2013 it expects growth of just 0.4% (not a typo), down from 1.6% previously. It also predicts stronger growth in 2014, with GDP expanding by 1.9%. The Bundesbank said it was clear that the core of the eurozone was feeling the full impact of the downturn in the periphery, saying: Given the difficult economic situation in some euro-area countries and widespread uncertainty, economic growth will be lower than previously assumed. The Bundesbank does not see a protracted slowdown but instead anticipates a return to growth path soon. It also admitted that the current slowdown could turn into a full-blown recession, saying: There are even indications that economic activity may fall in the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, The gloomier forecasts come just a day after the European Central Bank slashed its economic forecasts.

      "bodyText": "Major City investors have issued a stark warning to the government that there is little chance of selling off the taxpayers' stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group with the current uncertainty about regulations for the banking sector. As policymakers call on all banks \u2013 not just the bailed out ones \u2013 to bolster their capital levels in the face of the eurozone crisis and come clean about bad loans on their balance sheets, investors are calling for clarity about the type and amount of capital banks must hold. In a document released on Friday , the Association of British Insurers, whose members control a fifth of the stock market, indicated that investors are unlikely to buy shares in banks\u2013 which would help bolster their capital cushions\u2013 if they are not able to generate high enough returns on their investments. Investors have also indicated they were unlikely to buy shares in RBS or Lloyds until the banks resumed dividend payments. The government controls 82% of RBS and 40% of Lloyds through arm's length body UK Financial Investments. \"There is broad agreement that UKFI's ability to reduce its stakes in Lloyds Banking Group and RBS group is likely to be contingent on re-establishing a clear path to meaningful and sustainable dividend payments,\" the ABI said. The shareholder group's document also considers whether the need to hold more capital is reducing the returns banks are able to make to such an extent that they are not attractive to shareholders. Barclays, Lloyds and RBS all have stock market values that are only just over half of the value of their assets. The FSA is holding discussions with banks about the amount of capital they hold after concerns raised by the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee that accounting policies may be allowing them to delay making provisions for potential bad loans. The ABI agrees that investors need assurances about the quality of the loans banks hold but argues that banks already provide information about their policies of forbearance - where lenders are offered leniency - and make provisions for loans in their annual reports. While the ABI acknowledged that investors wanted banks to be safer it also wants them to be able to generate profits as this would allow them to pay dividends but also generate their own capital. But the ABI conceded: \"We recognise that public perception of the banking industry is such that the very notion of a bank making profit may, for many, be quite abhorrent\". The ABI is asking for clarity on the decision by the Independent Commission on Banking for banks to have a 10% core tier one capital ratio - a measure of financial strength- rather than the 7% set out by international regulators in Basel, Switzerland.
