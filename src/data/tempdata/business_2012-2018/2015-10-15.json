      "bodyText": "Several potential class-action lawsuits have been filed in Michigan against Volkswagen over the company\u2019s diesel emissions scandal, as US regulators ratcheted up questioning of the auto giant. The lengthy complaints filed in federal court in Detroit say Volkswagen deceived federal and state emissions standards by installing a so-called \u201cdefeat device\u201d in 482,000 Audi and Volkswagen vehicles sold in the US since 2009. Volkswagen already faces billions of dollars of fines, a criminal investigation and several state investigations as part of the worldwide cheating scandal, which have consumed the auto maker in recent weeks. The lawsuits, almost identical in language, say Volkswagen touted vehicles with \u201cextremely high fuel mileage coupled with low emissions\u201d but the equipped defeat devices allowed them to cheat emissions test. \u201cPut simply, [Volkswagen] lied and continued to lie over a period of years,\u201d the complaint stated. Attorneys with the Seattle-based Keller Rohrback LLP, which filed the complaints on Tuesday and Wednesday, told the Guardian additional lawsuits would be forthcoming, after VW executives testified before Congress earlier this month. The fresh round of complaints follows another batch the firm filed in September. Gretchen Freeman Cappio, one of the attorneys on the case, said the firm has been \u201cutterly slammed\u201d with calls and emails from consumers. Keller Rohrback now represents plaintiffs from nearly every state in the US, she said. Though the complaints are nearly identical, Freeman Cappio said consumer laws vary slightly state to state, therefore spurring the multiple lawsuits. \u201cSo because of that, you\u2019ll see that consumers from all different states across the country file lawsuits alleging similar facts,\u201d she told the Guardian. VW has admitted that 11m vehicles worldwide were fitted with a defeat device, which is a line of software code hidden within the cars\u2019 systems that knew when an emissions test was taken place. A spokeswoman for the company said in a statement that it cannot comment directly on the specific class-action lawsuits. \u201cVolkswagen is fully cooperating with all investigations regarding the emissions compliance issue,\u201d spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said. The lawsuits were filed in Detroit, as the investigations by the US Justice Department and FBI are taking place across the region, where the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Vehicle &amp; Fuel Emissions Laboratory is located. Volkswagen has an office with an estimated 1,100 employees in Auburn Hills, Michigan \u2013 about 30 minutes from Detroit. Freeman Cappio pointed to testimony from Michael Horn, Volkswagen Group of America CEO, before a US House panel on 8 October, when he said its Auburn Hills office is \u201cdirectly linked to the German research and development department\u201d. \u201cThey work together. They get all the information, all the results, testing things, technical specifications and then they file the applications for conformity,\u201d Horn said. He added that the office interacted \u201cdirectly on a working level, on a management level, on a daily basis with the EPA and [the California Air Resources Board].\u201d VW\u2019s ties with Michigan and the ongoing scandal are readily apparent, Freeman Cappio said. \u201cThe connections between the allegations in our lawsuit about defeat device vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen and Michigan could not be stronger,\u201d she said. Beside Volkswagen Group of America, Audi AG and Audi of America are named as defendants in the suits. The plaintiffs claim VW committed fraud by concealment, breached contracts through the sale of the defeat device vehicles, breached warranties, and unjustly enriched itself. It also asserts the company\u2019s conduct meets the threshold of a racketeering influenced and corrupt organization, or Rico, claim. The lawsuit asks for injunctive relief through a recall or free vehicle replacement, as well as unspecified damages.",

      "bodyText": "Treasury is a difficult portfolio to master, particularly for those with little or no background in the dark art of economics. And so it seems with the new treasurer, Scott Morrison, who is clearly having trouble coming to terms with some key economic and policy concepts. Less than a month into the role and Morrison\u2019s public utterances and grasp of fundamentally important issues have not been convincing. A new slogan, \u201cwork, save, invest\u201d, and an analysis of the government\u2019s budget deficit issue as one which is \u201ca spending problem, not revenue\u201d suggests Morrison is either putting politics ahead of economic policy or doesn\u2019t yet understand the linkages in the economy. When asked in question time this week about the fall in government revenue between the 2014 and 2015 budgets, Morrison fluffed and babbled about the \u201cstrong management of our budget\u201d \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 and in the next breath spoke of expenditure growth and some of the reasons why under the Coalition government spending is near the levels usually reserved for recessions. Morrison was also asked about perhaps the most fundamental long-run structural issue confronting the Australian economy, the fall in real disposable income per capita. He waffled. \u201cReal Australian living standards going forward are going to depend on something incredibly important. Australians, as they sit at home today, are concerned about their jobs, their family income and their family circumstances. As they are thinking about these issues, they are looking overseas, they are looking at volatility, they are looking at uncertainty and changes.\u201d This is the answer a year-12 student who did not study for their economics exam would give in the hope of bluffing the marker with weasel words. Morrison did not give a hint of understanding that it is the terms of trade decline and persistent sluggish growth in GDP since the global crisis that has meant income per person in Australia is falling. This decline is not only leading to a general mood of caution among consumers and business, but it is a critical element behind the still-slow growth in tax revenue. Yes, the economy needs to grow faster. Yes, Australia needs higher productivity growth. Yes, there is volatility, and yes to the bulk of other platitudes Morrison has uttered. The question is what he and the revamped Coalition are doing. There is a proverbial truckload of sound ideas in treasury relating to tax, infrastructure, labour-market laws, personal-benefit payments, commonwealth-state relations, the environment, education, and skills and training, among many others. These need to be presented to the treasurer. To be sure, many of the proposals are politically difficult and, often in the short term, involve some segment of the population losing out. But this is where Morrison needs to immerse himself in the policy detail and then go public on what the most meaningful policy adjustments are, why they are necessary and how they will benefit the economy. In other words, moving from politically driven waffle to matters of substance. In terms of the rhetorical flourishes, Morrison needs to base his pronouncements on facts, not perceptions. He needs to get the hard data on the size of government spending and taxation, the currently weak labour force data and as noted earlier, the impact of falling per capita incomes. Unless he does this, he risks taking the wrong policy measures to address problems that do not exist. His predecessor, Joe Hockey, fell victim to overblown rhetoric in the 2014 budget, which advocated a range of extreme policy proposals on government spending to tackling a budget deficit problem that was not only small but was largely the result of weak revenue. To be sure, it is early days and Morrison may grow into the role as he sees more of the treasury analysis of the economy, as he frames the mid-year economic and fiscal update and prepares the budget in May 2016. For the sake of the economy, which is nervously negotiating its way through falling income, slower population growth, budget deficits and a house-price boom, policy failure will end in tears.

      "bodyText": "A regulatory victory for the banks? Of course. Actually, it\u2019s two victories. First, under the new ringfencing rules, the retail operations of big banks will be able to pay dividends to their parent companies. Second, when things go spectacularly wrong at big banks, senior executives will no longer have to prove they took all reasonable steps to prevent catastrophe; instead, the burden of proof will lie with the regulator. Only one of these victories \u2013 the first \u2013 is deserved. An outright ban on ringfenced retail units paying dividends never made sense. Who would want to own, or invest in, a high street bank where surplus capital could be trapped permanently? Banks are still businesses, let\u2019s not forget. The important thing is that the regulator should decide how much capital a critical ringfenced bank requires and have the ability to veto distributions of cash to non-ringfenced entities. As long as those safeguards are in place \u2013 and are enforced rigorously by regulators \u2013 the system should be able to work smoothly. The Treasury\u2019s change to the burden of proof rule, on the other hand, appears to be a straightforward case of weak ministers capitulating to bankers\u2019 aggressive lobbying. The original idea, which flowed from the long parliamentary investigation of the collapses of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, was conceived as an honest answer to a serious problem. MPs, like the rest of us, were sick of hearing bosses of failed and unscrupulous banks pleading that they couldn\u2019t possibly be at fault because they had delegated their responsibilities or that decisions were made collectively. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, spoke of an \u201caccountability firewall\u201d. Thus it was reasonable to oblige senior bankers to show in future that they had acted responsibly. This was a reversal of normal UK legal principles, as bankers protested furiously, but the legislation was approved by parliament knowingly. It was still thought fair that bosses of large banks, organisations vital to the UK\u2019s financial health, should be able to explain their actions. We\u2019d had enough Macavity-like bankers who were never there. Yet the bankers\u2019 protests have now won the day, long after the final whistle was supposed to have blown. There will still be a \u201cduty of responsibility\u201d but the regulator will have to prove individuals\u2019 shortcomings if it wants to impose fines or bans. Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, calls it \u201ca change of process, not substance\u201d. That statement feels far too breezy. The Treasury\u2019s intervention takes us several steps back towards a pre-crisis system that failed to instil a culture of accountability. One of these days (months?), the official report into the failure of HBOS may be published to remind us how badly one of the country\u2019s biggest banks was managed. Tyrie \u2013 rightly \u2013 sounds less than impressed by reversal of the burden of proof, saying he would have preferred to see the original reforms given a chance to bed down. \u201cIt would be concerning if this change was a response to special pleading from the banks,\u201d he says. Yet that\u2019s exactly how it looks. Peak Burberry? Christopher Bailey, the designer who invigorated Burberry, now fills his days inspecting the minibar bills of his globe-trotting executives, or something like that. In his other role as chief executive, he\u2019s having to learn new tricks. Without \u201cswift action on discretionary costs\u201d, as the company put it, Burberry\u2019s minor warning on profits would have been the full check. An efficiency drive, meaning less travel and fewer expenses, will save \u00a320m and a cut in bonuses will save another \u00a320-\u00a330m. Even after a dose of (relative) austerity, however, pretax profits are expected to arrive at \u00a3445m for the whole financial year, which, within a million or two, would represent a second flat year in a row. The problem is the sales line: on a like-for-like basis, it was up 6% in the first quarter and down 4% in the second. Has Burberry peaked? That\u2019s probably premature, but the long run of easy growth on the back of a buoyant China is over. Chinese consumers are spending less and, increasingly, are doing so in places unhelpful to Burberry, such as continental Europe and Japan, where it has too few stores. There seems to be little wrong with the brand; and there is no evidence that Bailey\u2019s design flair has been affected by doing two jobs. But you can understand why the City took fright, pushing the shares down 8%. Burberry is a company set up for strong growth, and adjustment to a harder world probably won\u2019t be painless.",

      "bodyText": "A steel mill in south Wales will reopen after more than two years out of operation, on the same day as the government holds a crisis summit on the UK steel industry. The plant in Newport, reopening on Friday, will initially produce about 50,000 tonnes of steel a month with capacity to double that amount. Liberty House, an international steel and metals group, bought the 41-year-old site in July 2013. The company paid the plant\u2019s 150 workers half their salaries as it restructured its finances before reopening, its managing director, Sanjeev Gupta, said. \u201cSteel mills are almost impossible to revive once they have shut down. Some of these guys had been there for decades and if we had lost them it would have been almost impossible to restart,\u201d Gupta said. The plant will import slabs of steel from countries such as Russia or Brazil and process them into coil steel to be turned into fencing, crash barriers, lorry chassis and other products. The launch of Liberty Steel Newport is a rare piece of good news for the UK steel industry, which has blamed cheap imports, the strength of the pound and high energy prices for its current crisis. The government is holding a summit in Rotherham on Friday to discuss the industry\u2019s future after the closure of the SSI plant in Redcar with the loss of 2,200 jobs. Tata Steel has also cut production at its sites in Newport, Port Talbot and Rotherham with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. Trade union Unite called on the government to keep Redcar open so that a buyer could be found and to intervene to support the industry. Tony Burke, the union\u2019s assistant general secretary, who will attend the summit, said: \u201cThe Germans do it through an active industrial strategy and the Italians do it by intervening directly in their steel industry, making a mockery of ministers\u2019 claims that EU rules forbid it.\u201d Gupta said it was a good time for the mill to reopen because prices cannot go much lower, and there is lots of goodwill from suppliers and customers, against the backdrop of a growing UK economy. He said if energy prices for industrial businesses were brought in line with the rest of Europe, his plant could easily employ 1,000 people by expanding its activities into other types of steel.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Treasury moves to dilute a key part of the new regime intended to make top bank bosses more accountable will face scrutiny from a powerful committee of MPs next week. In a move seen as a sign that the government is softening its stance toward the industry, the Treasury said that it was dropping a plan to \u201creverse the burden of proof\u201d for managers, which would have forced them to demonstrate they had done the right thing if wrongdoing emerged on their watch. As the Treasury announced that the regime would also be extended to other parts of the financial services industry, it said that senior managers would be subject instead to a \u201cduty of responsibility\u201d clause, requiring them only to take appropriate steps to prevent a regulatory breach. Rob Moulton, regulatory partner at lawyers Ashurst, said the regulator\u2019s powers had been curbed: \u201cThis is a great step forward, and signals a pivotal moment in the relationship between the government and the regulators. There is no doubt who is the boss now.\u201d The accountancy body the ICAEW said senior managers would be \u201cbreathing a huge sigh of relief\u201d. The \u201csenior managers and certification regime\u201d is being introduced for banks, building societies, credit unions and some investment firms from March 2016. The extension to other financial firms will follow two years later in 2018. Around 60,000 firms will eventually be covered from the 1,500 originally envisaged. The regime was one of the ideas from the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie and established in the wake of Barclays\u2019 \u00a3290m fine in 2012 for rigging Libor. Tyrie, who also chairs the Treasury select committee, said he hoped the move had not been a response to industry lobbying. \u201cI would have preferred that more time had been taken to enable the new system to bed down. It would be concerning if this change was a response to special pleading from the banks,\u201d he said. The Treasury committee will question the UK chancellor, George Osborne, and senior City regulators \u2013 including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority arm of the Bank \u2013 next week about the move, which was announced in the Bank of England and financial services bill. The bill also includes measures to make the Bank of England more accountable. The changes came as the PRA also announced the next steps in implementing another of the proposals from Sir John Vickers in 2011 to make banks separate their high street operations from riskier investment banking operations. The six banks affected \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, the UK arm of the Spanish bank Santander and Co-operative Bank \u2013 could be required to hold \u00a33.3bn of extra capital - less than one percent of their current requirement - as a result of proposals. The banks were also granted a concession: the high street operations will be able to pay dividends back to the investment banking arm, a move the industry had feared would not be allowed and would have reduced the economic rationale for keeping both sides of the business. It means that concerns raised by banks such as HSBC \u2013 which is reviewing whether to remain in the UK \u2013 are being addressed by the government. Osborne has already reduced the bank levy which had angered HSBC. It also came as a report warned that UK banks were exposed to a \u201chigh risk\u201d of money laundering. The national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing said there were \u201csignificant\u201d intelligence gaps about the scale of laundering. Regulators played down the significance of the move to change the burden of proof for bank bosses. Bailey said: \u201cThe introduction of the \u2018duty of responsibility\u2019 in place of the \u2018presumption\u2019 makes little difference to the substance of the new regime. Once introduced, it will be for the regulators (rather than the senior manager) to prove that reasonable steps to prevent regulatory breaches were not taken. This change is one of process, not substance\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Treasury moves to dilute a key part of the new regime intended to make top bank bosses more accountable will face scrutiny from a powerful committee of MPs next week.</p> <p>In a move seen as a sign that the government is softening its stance toward the industry, the Treasury said that it was dropping a plan to \u201creverse the burden of proof\u201d for managers, which would have forced them to demonstrate they had done the right thing if wrongdoing emerged on their watch.</p> <p>As the Treasury announced that the regime would also be extended to other parts of the financial services industry, it said that senior managers would be subject instead to a \u201cduty of responsibility\u201d clause, requiring them only to take appropriate steps to prevent a regulatory breach.</p> <p>Rob Moulton, regulatory partner at lawyers Ashurst, said the regulator\u2019s powers had been curbed: \u201cThis is a great step forward, and signals a pivotal moment in the relationship between the government and the regulators. There is no doubt who is the boss now.\u201d The accountancy body the ICAEW said senior managers would be \u201cbreathing a huge sigh of relief\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201csenior managers and certification regime\u201d is being introduced for banks, building societies, credit unions and some investment firms from March 2016. The extension to other financial firms will follow two years later in 2018. Around 60,000 firms will eventually be covered from the 1,500 originally envisaged. </p> <p>The regime was one of the ideas from the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\">established in the wake</a> of Barclays\u2019 \u00a3290m fine in 2012 for rigging Libor.</p> <p>Tyrie, who also chairs the Treasury select committee, said he hoped the move had not been a response to industry lobbying. </p> <p>\u201cI would have preferred that more time had been taken to enable the new system to bed down. It would be concerning if this change was a response to special pleading from the banks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Treasury committee will question the UK chancellor, George Osborne, and senior City regulators \u2013 including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority arm of the Bank \u2013 next week about the move, which was announced in the Bank of England and financial services bill. The bill also includes measures to make the Bank of England more accountable.</p> <p>The changes came as the PRA <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/banks-rbs-hsbc-lloyds-barclays-santander-co-operative-capital-ringfencing\">also announced the next steps in implementing another of the proposals from Sir John Vickers in 2011</a> to make banks separate their high street operations from riskier investment banking operations.</p> <p>The six banks affected \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, the UK arm of the Spanish bank Santander and Co-operative Bank \u2013 could be required to hold \u00a33.3bn of extra capital - less than one percent of their current requirement - as a result of proposals. The banks were also granted a concession: the high street operations will be able to pay dividends back to the investment banking arm, a move the industry had feared would not be allowed and would have reduced the economic rationale for keeping both sides of the business.</p> <p>It means that concerns raised by banks such as HSBC \u2013 which is reviewing whether to remain in the UK \u2013 are being addressed by the government. Osborne has already reduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy\">the bank levy</a> which had angered HSBC.</p> <p>It also came as a report warned that UK banks were exposed to a \u201chigh risk\u201d of money laundering. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-risk-assessment-of-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing\">national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing</a> said there were \u201csignificant\u201d intelligence gaps about the scale of laundering.</p> <p>Regulators played down the significance of the move to change the burden of proof for bank bosses. Bailey said: \u201cThe introduction of the \u2018duty of responsibility\u2019 in place of the \u2018presumption\u2019 makes little difference to the substance of the new regime. Once introduced, it will be for the regulators (rather than the senior manager) to prove that reasonable steps to prevent regulatory breaches were not taken. This change is one of process, not substance\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/andrew-tyrie-bank-of-england-gertjan-vlieghe-mpc\">Andrew Tyrie criticises Bank of England for failing to protect Gertjan Vlieghe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tracey McDermott, acting boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, said: \u201cExtending the senior managers\u2019 and certification regime is an important step in embedding a culture of personal responsibility throughout the financial services industry.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Italian government has approved a series of business-friendly tax cuts and measures to boost consumer spending that could put Rome in breach of austerity budget rules set by Brussels. Prime minister Matteo Renzi said a reduction in the main corporation tax rate and reduced levies on agricultural and industrial equipment were aimed at supporting Italy\u2019s fragile recovery. Putting forward a budget for next year on the last day of a deadline set by the EU commission, Renzi said \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of tax cuts would include the abolition of a wealth tax on the main residence of all Italians, worth around \u20ac200 a year to most homeowners. The 40-year old said the package would make Italy \u201ca simpler and fairer country\u201d, adding: \u201cThis year not only are the taxes not going up but they are coming down.\u201d The proposals will now go before parliament, where they must be approved by the end of the year. However, the budget must also be approved by Brussels, which only last week warned the rightwing government of Mariano Rajoy in Spain that proposals to relax austerity measures in its 2016 budget could be rejected. New fiscal rules, adopted after the eurozone debt crisis, give the European commission power to seek amendments to national budgets. Renzi, who has made tax cuts a rallying cry ever since he came to office in February last year, appears to be prepared for a fight against the Brussels elite that wants Italy to take the opportunity of its recent recovery to step up fiscal tightening. Alessandro Zattoni, an economics professor at the LUISS business school in Rome, said the EU commission is concerned that the deterioration in world trade following the slowdown in China could hurt the Italian economy, hitting tax revenues and further widening the budget deficit. Last month, the government increased its target for 2016\u2019s deficit to 2.2% of output, up from 1.8%, and said it expected the national debt to hit 131.4% of national income (GDP), up from a previous forecast of 130.9%. Renzi said that nonetheless, the debt-to-GDP ratio would begin to fall next year for the first time in nine years, and said other countries that were critical of Italy did not themselves respect the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. Zattoni said Brussels was likely to give Renzi a fair hearing after he imposed stringent austerity measures last year and was forced to increase spending this year to cope with the refugee crisis. \u201cIt is about the feeling in Brussels. And I think that has improved after a series of reforms and Renzi\u2019s handling of the refugee situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Brussels will want to keep an eye on Rome because it is concerned that the economy and the budget could be vulnerable to a deterioration in global trade.\u201d He said business-friendly tax cuts and reforms were good news for the business community and especially entrepreneurs, which have struggled against a tax system that can sometimes charge more than 100% of profits. Reforms to the pension system, allowing older workers to work part-time while drawing their pension, could also free up jobs for younger workers, he said. A tax break for employers who hire staff on unlimited contracts will be continued, although the benefit to employers could be cut after it proved hugely successful. The government ams to limit the growth in short-term contracts that have played a dominant role since the financial crash but have also left millions of younger workers on low pay with little job security.",

      "bodyText": "The European markets have just closed, so let\u2019s recap. Shares in luxury fashion group Burberry have closed down 8.2% after the company warned that demand was slowing, led by falling sales in Asia. The selloff wiped more than half a billion pounds off Burberry\u2019s market capitalisation, sending the company to the bottom of the FTSE 100. Burberry is planning to cut remuneration, starting at the top, reports Bloomberg tonight: Burberry Group CEO Christopher Bailey will get a pay cut along with other employees after the U.K. trenchcoat maker forecast a second year of declining profit because of weakness in Asia. The company will cut bonuses and long-term share incentives by as much as 30 million pounds ($46.5 million), Chief Financial Officer Carol Fairweather said on a conference call Thursday. Burberry also plans to trim discretionary costs like travel by 20 million pounds this financial year in response to plummeting sales in China. The blue chip FTSE 100 index jumped over 1%, though, to finish at 6338 points. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct sums up the day: It\u2019s been a day of decent gains for London\u2019s FTSE-100 with the index adding around 1% by the close. The vast majority of stocks are sitting in positive territory but with concerns continuing to build over the Chinese economy, it\u2019s mining stocks that have been left wearing much of the losses. The biggest faller however was Burberry and with some suggestions that China accounts for as much as 40% of sales, that cautionary note about difficult conditions in Asia Pacific in this morning\u2019s results has rattled the high end fashion retailer. On a brighter note, ARM Holdings is finding support as a result of read-across from sector peers, whilst results from Unilever have helped prop up the consumer goods play with Europe\u2019s hot summer boosting ice cream sales. Over in New York, Goldman Sachs has missed Wall Street forecasts for the first time since 2011. Shares in the investment back are up around 1% at pixel time, though, as traders anticipate little action on US interest rates soon. The latest US inflation report, showing the cost of living was unchanged year-on-year, doesn\u2019t give the Fed an excuse to raise rates right now.... ....especially with another row over the US debt ceiling looming. Pressure is mounting on the Brazilian government after Fitch downgraded its credit rating, to the brink of junk status. And Volkswagen is to recall all 8.5 million European cars which contain \u2018defeat devices\u2019 to avoid failing emissions tests. That\u2019s all for today, I think. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Over in Italy, the government has approved a growth-friendly, expansionary budget in an attempt to get the country\u2019s economy moving faster. My colleague Phillip Inman explains: The Italian government has approved a series of business-friendly tax cuts and measures to boost consumer spending that could put Rome in breach of austerity budget rules set by Brussels. Prime minister Matteo Renzi said a reduction in the main corporation tax rate and cuts to levies on agricultural and industrial equipment were aimed supporting the country\u2019s fragile recovery. Putting forward a budget for next year on the last day of a deadline set by the EU commission, Renzi said \u20ac5bn worth of tax cuts would include the abolition of a wealth tax on the main residence of all Italians, worth around \u20ac200 a year to most homeowners. The 40-year-old prime minister said the package would make Italy become \u201ca simpler and fairer country,\u201d adding: \u201cThis year not only are the taxes not going up but they are coming down,\u201d The proposals will now go before parliament, where it must be approved by the end of the year. Greece\u2019s biggest thinktank, IOBE, has a stern warning for the country\u2019s politicians today - this is your last chance to fix the crisis. IOBE urged MPs to stick to Greece\u2019s bailout plan and implement the economic reforms it needs, as it predicted a less severe recession than feared. The Kathimerini newspaper explains: In its quarterly report, IOBE said the economy would shrink by 1.5 to 2.0 percent this year, less than forecast by Greece\u2019s international lenders. It also said the economy could return to growth in the second half of 2016 provided the government takes steps urgently to shore up the battered banking sector, reform Greece\u2019s ailing pension system and make the country more business-friendly. There are fresh rumblings of discontent in Greece as the Athens parliament prepares to vote on new austerity measures on Friday. Around 200 demonstrators from the communist PAME union blocked the Labour Ministry today, carrying a banner reading \u201chands off the social security system\u201d Newsflash from Volkswagen: the German carmaker is to recall 8.5 million cars across Europe to address the emissions scandal. This follows Germany\u2019s rejection of a voluntary recall this morning. This will include the 1.2m cars sold in the UK. There\u2019s no word yet on when the recall will take place. Here\u2019s Reuters early take. The Brazilian currency, the real, has shed 1% against the US dollar since Fitch downgraded Brazil\u2019s rating. Brazil has just been downgraded to the brink of junk status by Fitch. Fitch has cut its rating on Brazil by one notch to BBB-, which is the lowest \u2018investment grade level. It also left Brazil with a negative outlook, suggesting it could be downgraded again. Brazil is currently in recession, hit by the emerging market slowdown, falling commodity prices, a weak currency, and political scandals. And Fitch fears that its government will struggle to get its debts under control. It predicts that the deficit could hit 9% of GDP this year, and remain above 6% in the next two years. The statement says: The rating downgrade reflects Brazil\u2019s rising government debt burden, increased challenges to fiscal consolidation and a worsening economic growth backdrop. The difficult political environment is hampering progress on the government\u2019s legislative agenda and creating a negative feedback loop for the broader economy. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch\u2019s view that economic and fiscal underperformance is likely to persist while political uncertainty could continue weighing on broader confidence, delay a turnaround in investment and growth, and increase risks for the medium term fiscal consolidation needed for debt stabilization. There\u2019s nothing here to surprise astute City investors: The FT\u2019s Robin Wigglesworth has helpfully tweeted Jack Lew\u2019s warning about the debt ceiling: Burberry\u2019s warning of falling luxury goods demand has hit sentiment across the sector, and follows similar problems at LVMH. My colleague Julie Kollewe explains: Burberry has blamed a sharp slowdown in sales on a tough market for luxury goods, in particular weaker demand from Chinese customers. Shares in the FTSE 100 company, known for its British-made trench coats and cashmere scarves, tumbled as much as 12.6% on the news, to \u00a312.36. This is a three-year low, and wiped \u00a3800m from Burberry\u2019s stock market value. Shares across the luxury sector were hit, including Prada, Hermes, Kering and Salvatore Ferragamo. Burberry joins LVMH, which earlier this week became the first major luxury goods company to warn that the stock market collapse in China over the summer had affected sales, particularly at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand. Here\u2019s her full take: The opening bell has been rung on Wall Street, and the main indices are creeping higher. Investors are digesting the fall in profits at Goldman Sachs, the drop in the annual US inflation rate to zero, and Burberry\u2019s China warning. The feeling in New York, as in Europe, is that there\u2019s little pressure on the Fed to raise borrowing costs. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.35% in early trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 0.7%. The dreaded US debt ceiling is creeping back onto the agenda. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has just warned that America will run out of spending wriggle room on November 3rd, two days earlier than expected. So if Congress doesn\u2019t agree to raise the limit by then, we could face a repeat of the 2013 crisis. Two years ago, the US experienced a government shutdown after hitting the debt ceiling. The number of Americans signing on for new unemployment benefit last week has hit a 42 year low. Just 255,000 American people filed \u201cinitial claims\u201d last week, suggesting that US firms are retaining staff. The cost of living in America was flat last month, according to new inflation data just released. The US consumer prices index was unchanged year-on-year in September, with cheaper fuel keeping inflation pegged. That\u2019s down from the annual inflation rate of 0.2% recorded in August, and the lowest reading in eight months. On a monthly basis, the CPI fell by 0.2% in September compared to August, due to cheaper gasoline. It rather vindicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold this month. The report also shows a small rise in \u2018core CPI\u2019, which strips out volatile elements from the inflation data. It rose by 0.2% in September, up from 0.1% in August. Annual core inflation pushed up to 1.9% - suggesting that underlying inflation pressures may be building. America\u2019s biggest motorhome maker, Winnebago Industries, has given another warning that some consumers are cutting back. Profits at Winnebago fell 9% in the last quarter, with customers favouring less expensive models. Sales of Class A models fell by a third, while cheaper B and C class sales rose. Analysts see Winnebago as a bellweather for high-end consumer spending in America, so this could show some belt-tightening is underway. A top-of-the-range Winnebago is a serious investment. The class A Grand Tour costs at least $429,082; they do look quite cosy though.... Here\u2019s our early news story on Goldman\u2019s results: That\u2019s a 51% jump in profits at Citi - a year ago, they made just 88 cents per share in the July-September quarter. And here comes Citigroup....and they\u2019ve beaten expectations, with profits of $1.31 per share, against forecasts of $1.28. This is the first time in around four years that Goldman Sachs has missed forecasts, according to the FT: Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs has missed Wall Street estimates for profits and revenue in the last quarter. Goldman has reported that it made adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share in the three months to 30 September, a little shy of the $2.91 per share expected. That\u2019s a big decline on Q3 2014, when Goldman made profits of $4.57 per share. Revenues came in at $6.86bn, below estimates of $7.12bn. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein blamed fears over the world economy, telling shareholders that: \u201cWe experienced lower levels of activity and declining asset prices during the quarter, reflecting renewed concerns about global economic growth. Revenues from \u201cFixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution\u201d were down by a third, as Goldman\u2019s customers cut back on trading bonds, foreign exchange, metals, oil, etc. Blankfein remains optimistic, though: We continue to see strong levels of activity in Investment Banking and growth in Investment Management, and looking ahead, are encouraged by the competitive positioning of our global client franchise. Our focus on serving our clients and improving operating leverage puts us in a strong position to generate superior returns for our shareholders.\u201d The results are online here. It\u2019s nearly time for Goldman Sachs\u2019 results... Another Volkswagen development - the carmaker has been ordered to recall all its 2.4m vehicles on the road in Germany. VW has hoped to implement a voluntary recall, in which drivers could have chosen to get the \u2018defeat device\u2019 which cheated emissions tests removed. Berlin, though, wants a compulsory recall. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The decision is likely to mean that all 1.2m vehicles affected by the scandal in the UK will also be formally recalled. The US stock market is expected to open higher in two and a half hours time, following Europe\u2019s rally this morning. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called 105 point higher, at 17030, in the futures market. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: US markets look set for a stronger open buoyed by hopes of improved earnings in the banking sector and increased odds of zero percent interest rates for the rest of the year. Over in parliament, the UK boss of Volkswagen has repeated his apology to customers over the emissions scandal. Paul Willis also promised to \u2018do the right think\u2019 for those affected. In other news this morning, the Bank of England has issued new details of the push to split retail banking and investment bank arms. Banks have been warned that they might have to set aside up to \u00a33.3bn of extra capital, but also told that ringfenced divisions could be allowed to pay a dividend to other units. Analysts reckon that the extra capital hit isn\u2019t too onerous: Burberry CFO Carol Fairweather has blamed August\u2019s stock market turmoil for the decline in sales in China: She told reporters: \u201cWe believe this affected the confidence of and thus demand from luxury consumers, and especially the Chinese customers insome of our key markets,\u201d Fairweather told reporters.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quote): Burberry\u2019s sales figures look better if you strip out the falling sales in China, and particularly in Hong Kong where they are down 20%. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the last six months: Double-digit percentage growth in EMEIA* : driven by the travelling luxury customer, particularly in continental Europe [* that\u2019s Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa] Low single-digit percentage growth in Americas: uneven demand in the United States, double-digit percentage growth in rest of Americas Mid single-digit percentage decline in Asia Pacific: Hong Kong decelerated further in second quarter David Madden of IG says Burberry shares have \u201ctaken a battering this morning\u201d: Burberry took full advantage of the expanding Chinese middle class over the years, and now those middle-income earners will keep shopping more locally from now on. Perhaps Boris Johnson can give Burberry\u2019s sales a lift? He\u2019s following in the footsteps of another politician, Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis, who wore Burberry to his first meeting of eurozone finance ministers in February: European stock markets are shrugging off Burberry\u2019s disappointing results. The main indices are all up nearly 1% this morning, as traders anticipate that central bankers will maintain loose monetary policy for a while. Burberry\u2019s problems do feed into that narrative; weak Chinese consumer spending could put more pressure on the People\u2019s Bank of China to stimulate the economy. Burberry CFO Carol Fairweather also insisted that today\u2019s announcement is not a profit warning. In today\u2019s statement, Burberry does say that earnings would be \u201cbroadly in line with the average of those analysts who have recently updated forecasts\u201d. But today\u2019s sales slowdown has come as a nasty shock to some investors, who have now driven Burberry\u2019s shares down over 12%. Burberry\u2019s shares are on track for its biggest one-day fall since 2012: Burberry are briefing the media now on a conference call. Carol Fairweather, chief financial officer, reveals that comparable sales have fallen by 4% in the second quarter of the financial year (July-September), after growing 6% in the first quarter (April-June). The company is taking out \u00a320m of costs in a bid to maintain profitability. Fairweather also says that Chinese consumers are still spending, but only when they\u2019re travelling abroad rather than buying from Burberry stores in mainland China. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, points out that Burberry\u2019s problems began in Hong Kong, where sales fell by over 10% in the April-June quarter: \u201cThe news from Burberry is chequered once more, with an underwhelming second quarter not quite sufficient to take the shine from a reasonable first half of the year. However, as can be seen from the share price reaction, the market is in no mood to take prisoners at present. As with markets in general, the company is naming China as the main culprit, where sales are subject to increasing pressure, washing out also to Hong Kong, where further deceleration is being seen. In addition, the general economic malaise has resulted in uneven demand in the US from both domestic and tourist customers alike. Today\u2019s selloff has sent Burberry\u2019s shares down to their lowest level since April 2013: Boom! Burberry\u2019s shares have fallen by over 10% , as investors give their verdict to today\u2019s disappointing sales figures. Shares lost 145p to \u00a312.74, wiping around \u00a3600m off the company\u2019s value. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 40 points at the start of trading, driven by hopes that US interest rates will remain at their current lows until the end of the year (at least). But Burberry\u2019s shares haven\u2019t traded yet, suggesting market makers are struggling to match bids..... Retail analyst Nick Bubb doesn\u2019t like the look of Burberry\u2019s figures. Here\u2019s his first take: The worry beforehand was that group performance would be hit by the slowdown in China and the comment that \u201cFor full-year 2016, we expect that adjusted profits before tax will be broadly in line with the average of those analysts who have recently downgraded forecasts\u201d is ominous. The news that first half retail sales were only up by 2% underlying, \u201cin an increasingly challenging environment for luxury customers\u201d, implying that Q2 sales were down.... China\u2019s slowing economy has hit Burberry, and forced the company to speed up its cost-cutting plans. The luxury goods firm has reported sales figures which have missed City expectations. Underlying retail sales are up just 2% to \u00a3774m in the six months to 30 September, short of forecasts of an 8% rise. Burberry blamed an \u201cincreasingly challenging environment for luxury customers\u201d, particularly in China. China has been a major source of sales growth for Burberry for many years; but demand is being hit by weaker growth, as Beijing tries to rebalance its economy. The stock market turmoil in August may also have hurt demand for luxury products. Christopher Bailey, chief creative officer and CEO, says: \u201cThe external environment became more challenging during the half, affecting luxury consumer demand in some of our key markets. In response, we have intensified our focus on driving sales and productivity, while taking swift action on discretionary costs. While mindful of this external volatility, our plans for the festive season position us well to return to a more positive sales trend in the all-important second half. Looking further ahead, we maintain our focus on - and confidence in - the long-term growth opportunities for our business across channels, regions and product categories.\u201d Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are expected to rally today, as investors decide that the Federal Reserve is increasingly unlikely to raise interest in 2015. Yesterday\u2019s disappointing US retail sales report, and a warning from Walmart, has added to speculation that America\u2019s economy isn\u2019t strong enough to shoulder a rate hike right now. And that bad news could be good news for shares, it seems. We\u2019ll get a better picture of the US economy at 1.30pm BST, when the latest inflation figures are released. Could it add to growing deflationary fears, after the US inflation rate turned negative yesterday? And in the City, we have results from Burberry and Unilever to chew through - plus Goldman Sachs\u2019 results this afternoon. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

Clarke said the biggest driver for non-fiction book sales had been adult colouring. The craze lifted both book sales and sales of pens as shoppers sought the right equipment. The change in fortunes comes as WH Smith spreads its wings into new areas including overseas stores and the multichannel greetings card retailer, Funky Pigeon. A 4% rise in underlying sales at the group\u2019s travel stores offset a 3% slide at high street outlets. In its latest attempt to find growth, WH Smith is to open 10 more cut-price Cardmarket stores by Christmas \u2013 taking the total to 30. The retailer faces increasing competition from rival Card Factory, which is benefiting from the trend towards discounters across the high street, as well as from supermarkets and health and beauty stores. \u201cWe have got some good Cardmarket stores and some not so good. We want to test our ability to pick 10 winners,\u201d said Clarke. He said the company would wait until the spring before deciding whether to expand the chain further. Cardmarket could boost performance in WH Smith\u2019s high street division. Clarke insisted the high street stores had been \u201cgood for us\u201d. He said profits continued to grow despite the sales fall as WH Smith cut \u00a311m of costs and sold an increased amount of more profitable items including stationery, headphones and souvenirs. As the company suffered continuing criticism from the @WHS Carpet twitter feed \u2013 where people post pictures of worn store flooring \u2013 Clarke said \u00a31m had been spent on new flooring in the last year and that flooring in 300 stores had been replaced since he took over as chief executive two and a half years ago. He pledged that \u201ca big chunk\u201d of WH Smith\u2019s \u00a339m capital expenditure in the year ahead would go into maintaining stores. A further \u00a32m or \u00a33m a year will be spent on funding the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d for over-25s when it comes into force next year. Clarke said WH Smith would not be following other retailers\u2019 lead and lifting wages earlier or extending the rise to the under-25s. The retailer will open 20 non-high street stores in the year ahead \u2013 half in travel locations such as stations and airports, and half in hospitals. In September, WH Smith pledged to cut prices in its hospital stores after widespread criticism.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen is to recall 8.5m diesel cars across the European Union in the wake of the emissions scandal. The full extent of the work required by the manufacturer to deal with the defeat devices in its diesel vehicles became apparent on Thursday after German authorities rejected its proposals for a voluntary scheme. Germany\u2019s federal motor transport authority ordered a compulsory recall of all the affected 2.4m Volkswagen cars in the country, triggering the move by VW across all 28 EU member states. It means that all 1.2m vehicles affected by the scandal in the UK will be formally recalled. Volkswagen said it welcomed the German decision, which would \u201cgive customers clarity with regard to the continued unrestricted use of the vehicles\u201d. However, VW had proposed a voluntary recall of the cars, which would have meant that motorists only took their car in for repairs if they wanted to remove the defeat device. VW has told motorists their cars remain legal to drive on the basis that they passed emissions tests, even if this was only due to the defeat device. VW has admitted that 11m diesel cars worldwide have been fitted with a defeat device that manipulated emissions tests. The company has put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to meet the costs of recalling the cars but also faces the threat of fines and legal action from shareholders and customers. US regulators say they have more questions for VW after the company\u2019s recent disclosure of additional suspect engineering of 2016 diesel models that could help exhaust systems run cleaner during official tests. The carmaker has said that a recall of the affected vehicles should begin early in 2016 but may not be completed by the end of the year. Some of the vehicles can be repaired through software changes, but others will need new parts, such as fuel injectors, to be installed. The German authorities need to approve VW\u2019s recall plan before the company can begin repairing vehicles around the world. Alexander Dobrindt, the German transport minister, confirmed there would be a compulsory recall. He said: \u201cVW is ordered to remove the software from all vehicles and to take appropriate measures to ensure that the emissions rules are fulfilled.\u201d Dobrinbt claimed that cooperation between VW and the authorities had been \u201cextraordinarily good\u201d. However, he also warned that the hardware changes required to fix some of the cars may not be ready until September 2016. Law firms representing British consumers stepped up the pressure on VW after the UK boss of Volkswagen, Paul Willis, again appeared in front of MPs promising to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Leigh Day, which said it was now representing more than 4,000 potential plaintiffs, said Willis\u2019s reassurances \u201cdo not begin to address the many concerns that our clients have in relation to their vehicles\u201d. Slater and Gordon, another firm which said it had been approached by more than 3,000 car owners, has written again to VW warning that the carmaker\u2019s response to owners\u2019 concerns was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d. Italian authorities have raided the country\u2019s Volkswagen HQ as part of a local investigation into the emissions-rigging scandal. Police in Verona searched the offices of Volkswagen Italia and confirmed that officials were under investigation. The new chief executive of Volkswagen has remained upbeat, telling managers at Leipzig in a speech that the manufacturer can bounce back from the scandal. Matthias M\u00fcller said VW would need to devolve more power to its brands and regional operations, declaring: \u201cWe have a good chance of shining again in two to three years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s might be slipping up in the US, its home market, but in the UK the fast food chain enjoyed another year of growth, according to figures for 2014. Turnover for the group\u2019s UK operation increased by \u00a367.5m to \u00a31.4bn, even though the group is increasingly franchising restaurants, which tends to reduce revenues. McDonald\u2019s said the improving economic outlook in the UK in 2014 resulted in increased sales and margins but added that its high street estate continued to be impacted by declining retail footfall. The fast food restaurant operator has tried to counter the reduced traffic on the high street by upgrading its voucher scheme for customers who visit affected restaurants. Profit before tax for 2014 came in at \u00a3225m, compared with \u00a3244.9m, on which the UK operation paid tax of \u00a357.7m, up from \u00a349.95m the previous year. A McDonald\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe are testing some new concepts, such as table service, whereby customers place their order via our new digital kiosks and then have their food brought to them. To date this has been well received and we will continue to review and rollout when appropriate over the coming months.\u201d On wage costs and the implementation of a \u201cnational living wage\u201d, McDonald\u2019s said it was working through the implications to see how it would impact the business. The corporation has generally enjoyed a consistent performance in the UK, even when it has been in decline in the US. The group is currently run by a Briton, Steve Easterbrook, who has been trying to revive the chain, which is facing fierce competition from rivals such as Five Guys and Shake Shack. Britain\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s opened in 1974 and there are now more than 1,250 in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "My friend Dick Joyce, who has died aged 92, was a polymath to the point of implausibility, fitting in segments of half a dozen different careers into one very happy life. Son of Kathleen (nee Message) and Jimmy Joyce, Dick was born in Alrewas, Staffordshire. His father was a managing director at the Schweppes drinks company. Dick was still at school, at Bryanston, near Blandford Forum, Dorset, when the second world war began, but signed up in 1943. He applied to join intelligence and was sent to Bletchley Park the following year, where he worked on decrypting Japanese diplomatic messages. In 1945 he was moved on to Jerusalem, where he spent 18 months eavesdropping on members of the embryonic Jewish government. On 22 July the following year, he was at the British headquarters at the King David hotel when it was blown up, and sustained a back injury that would trouble him for the rest of his life. He then studied economics and moral sciences (as psychology was then called) at Cambridge University, gaining first-class honours in the latter, followed by a BSc in physiology and a PhD in pharmacology. In 1953 he became a lecturer in psychopharmacology at the University of London, then senior lecturer and reader, and in 1966 joint chairman of the department of pharmacology and therapeutics at the London Hospital Medical College. He was seduced into industry by the offer of leadership of the newly created group for methodology (later project innovation) in the medical department of Ciba-Geigy (subsequently Novartis) where the enlightened Swiss management gave him his head to delve into whatever line of inquiry he thought fruitful. At various times, he was a member of UN, WHO, UK and French advisory boards and Swiss committees on drug dependence, clinical trial methodology, patient and physician compliance, quality of life methodology and complementary medicine. He served on the editorial boards of several journals, and published more than 200 papers, as well as editing five books. His passion, however, was a struggle to write poetry and, much later, an autobiography, a novel and short stories. He encouraged everyone to explore life \u2013 in my case parliamentary life \u2013 and enriched the world around him. He is survived by his second wife, Ism\u00e8ne (nee Kostakis), whom he married in 1962, and by their son, Nick, daughter, Cressida, and grandson. Towards the end, he reflected: \u201cI\u2019ve led (or been led by) a fantastically happy life. Which parts were influential? Either none, if everything happens by chance; or all, if everything is predetermined.\u201d Dick Joyce finished as he had lived, curious, inquiring and humorous. Some called his sense of humour British. Others knew it to be entirely Dickish.",

He encouraged everyone to explore life \u2013 in my case parliamentary life \u2013 and enriched the world around him.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Ism\u00e8ne (nee Kostakis), whom he married in 1962, and by their son, Nick, daughter, Cressida, and grandson.</p> <p>Towards the end, he reflected: \u201cI\u2019ve led (or been led by) a fantastically happy life. Which parts were influential? Either none, if everything happens by chance; or all, if everything is predetermined.\u201d Dick Joyce finished as he had lived, curious, inquiring and humorous. Some called his sense of humour British. Others knew it to be entirely Dickish.</p>",

The operator of pipes and pylons said it had enlisted power stations to provide extra capacity and asked companies to be ready to reduce usage to help it meet peak demand. The additional capacity means forecast requirements are manageable, National Grid said. The measures will cost the average electricity customer less than 50p a year, it added. This years forecast capacity margin \u2013 the difference between available supply and expected peak demand \u2013 is 1.2% before the additional measures, the lowest since 2005-6. With the additional capacity included it rises to 5.1%. In its winter report, National Grid said: \u201cThe winter view analysis has informed our procurement of additional contingency balancing reserve. These additional balancing services are in place and there is an increased likelihood we will use these tools to help us balance the system over the winter period. \u201cWe expect electricity margins to be tight but manageable for this winter. We have procured our contingency balancing services which we may need to use in order to help us balance the system.\u201d National Grid has faced criticism for allowing a fall in spare capacity from a peak of 16.8% \u2013 excluding additional sources \u2013 as recently as 2011-2012. This winter it will have less breathing space after closures and reduction in output at a number of power stations. Amber Rudd, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \u201cKeeping the lights on is non-negotiable. National Grid has the right tools in place to manage the system this winter and we will ensure that they continue to do so in future.\u201d The solar energy industry has blamed the antiquated state of Britain\u2019s electricity grid for preventing new connections to the system. The distribution network operator for the Midlands, south-west England and Wales has closed the grid to new large renewable projects in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset for up to six years. The solar sector has also criticised the government for lack of support after a series of solar panel providers going into liquidation. The government has placed a cap on the total amount of money available to renewable energy businesses as part of efforts to cut the budget deficit. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: \u201cEvery year the National Grid say they can keep the lights on, but every winter some still say our energy infrastructure will struggle to cope. \u201cGeorge Osborne needs to empower cities and towns to provide local, decentralised energy which can help provide the resilience that the country needs, alongside a smart interconnected grid and clean energy.\u201d Peak demand periods during the winter are expected to be weekdays between November and February. Demand will be at its highest in mid-December, and supply will be tightest in the weeks beginning 26 October and 11 January, National Grid said. \u201cWe currently expect there to be sufficient generation and interconnector imports to meet even the tightest week,\u201d it added.",

      "bodyText": "Parents could be spending millions of pounds more than they need to on school uniforms because of exclusive deals between schools and suppliers, the government\u2019s competition watchdog has warned. Headteachers and school governing bodies were told by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Thursday that they must let parents \u201cshop around\u201d for affordable uniforms for their children, using supermarkets if they wish rather than be forced to buy more expensive items in exclusive arrangements with suppliers. In a highly unusual move, the CMA has written an open letter to all headteachers, governing bodies and suppliers in England warning that they must let parents buy uniforms at the best possible prices. The sale of school uniforms has come under fresh scrutiny after the CMA said it was bombarded with complaints from parents concerned about prices and quality after buying uniforms for the start of the school year in September. It was shocked to find that some parents in England had been forced to pay up to \u00a310 extra per item of uniform where schools had appointed exclusive suppliers. The CMA has warned that such arrangements \u201cmay not be offering parents value for money\u201d and urged suppliers and retailers with such agreements in place with schools to check they are not in breach of competition law. A CMA spokesman said: \u201cThis letter is primarily addressed to state schools, including academies and free schools. But we do also encourage fee-paying schools to review their arrangements.\u201d It is advising school governing bodies to call for a review of uniform arrangements to ensure there is competition between suppliers and retailers, and is urging headteachers to listen to parents, take note of Department for Education (DfE) guidance and prioritise value for money when choosing uniform policy. Other suppliers and retailers who are struggling to sell school uniforms because of exclusive supply arrangements are being urged to complain to the CMA. Supermarkets now engage in an annual supermarket school uniform price war, which was kicked off this year by the German discount chain Aldi, which offered an entire school uniform for just \u00a34. Suppliers could be fined if the CMA finds evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. Its director of enforcement, Ann Pope, said: \u201cBuying school uniforms can be very expensive and particularly hits low-income families and those with a number of children, so it is important parents and carers are able to shop around. \u201cWe urge everyone involved to ensure that they are providing a good service to parents and carers and complying with DfE guidance. We will continue monitoring the sector and will consider taking enforcement action, if it is necessary.\u201d Suppliers could be fined if the CMA finds evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, in breach of the Competition Act 1998. The move is backed by charity the Children\u2019s Society, which earlier this year discovered families with school-age children spend an average of \u00a3316 a year on school clothing for a child at a state secondary and \u00a3251 for one at a state primary. The poll of 1,000 parents found that about \u00a32.1bn is spent each year on school clothes in the UK \u2013 \u00a31.3bn more than the amount mothers and fathers think would be reasonable. The rise of academies and free schools, which often require parents to buy expensive, branded garments from one agreed supplier, have also increased the financial burden for many parents. Sam Royston, director of policy at the Children\u2019s Society, said: \u201cSchool uniform costs can be a millstone around the necks of poorer parents, contributing to a cycle of debt and damaging the opportunities and wellbeing of lower-income pupils. \u201cOne reason for the high costs are policies that force parents to buy clothing from specialist shops, and prevent them from buying cheaper items from supermarkets. We hope the CMA\u2019s letter will prompt all schools to take a fresh look at their policies and make sure every parent is given the chance to shop around for the best deal.\u201d A survey by the now defunct Office of Fair Trading in 2012 found 74% of state schools placed restrictions on where uniforms can be bought, leading to parents paying \u00a35 to \u00a310 more for individual items. The OFT found each school was receiving an average of \u00a3676 a year from the tie-ups.",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer launches 'personalised' loyalty card", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to reward regular shoppers with access to exclusive food and drink masterclasses and personalised money-off offers, under its Sparks members club scheme being unveiled this month. The retailer said the ambitious move was based on its research, which showed that customers were fed up with being bombarded with \u201cuntargeted and irrelevant\u201d generic deals and discounts, instead demanding tailored and priority offers as well as \u201cmoney-can\u2019t buy\u201d treats. Its 2m \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d \u2013 predominantly shareholders and holders of its credit and debit cards \u2013 will be invited to apply for the card on Thursday online and via an app, before it is launched nationwide in store on 22 October. The launch of Sparks follows the billions of pounds spent by the chief executive of M&amp;S, Marc Bolland, on the redesign of products, stores, supply chain logistics and the firm\u2019s website to address decades of underinvestment. Last year it switched the M&amp;S website from an Amazon platform to one of its own, which it claims has given it better customer insight to help exploit its traditionally strong UK base. The retailer already operates a points-based loyalty scheme for customers holding M&amp;S Bank credit or debt cards. That scheme offers a point for every pound spent, in a similar way to reward cards operated by Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s. However, under the new scheme, members build up Sparks points every time they shop (in store and online), depending on how much they spend, and also for writing product reviews and shwopping, handing over unwanted clothing (which then goes to Oxfam) when buying brand new. Shoppers signing up to the scheme will earn 10 points for every visit to the till, as well as 10 for every \u00a31 spent in stores. When registering, members give details of their hobbies and interests \u2013 such as fashion, sport and cooking \u2013 which determine the types of offers or discounts they receive, for example 10% off fresh flowers or a bottle of Prosecco to go with a meal deal. At the top end of the scale, 14,000 points will open up events like fashion shows and masterclasses, while 17,000 will enter card holders into draws that offer prizes such as a trip to a South African vineyard. M&amp;S \u2013 131 years old and with 33 million UK customers and 852 stores \u2013 said it had taken a fresh look at loyalty and designed the new scheme in collaboration with more than 600 regular shoppers over a four-year period. During a recent three-month trial in south Wales, it recruited 100,000 members to test and refine the scheme, which also offers money (1p per transaction) to the members\u2019 chosen charities. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, executive director of marketing at M&amp;S, said the move represented an opportunity for store managers to reconnect with their local shoppers. \u201cCustomers tell us they want to \u2018be part of something special\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly why Sparks is a club,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a member, you are more than a customer and you\u2019ll get the most from M&amp;S \u2013 with tailor-made offers, priority access and invites to exclusive events. It\u2019s a two-way relationship: members tell us what they enjoy, select their own tailored offers and are rewarded for sharing their views.\u201d But the launch comes as rivals simplify their own reward cards and schemes, including Morrisons, which recently announced plans to revamp its unwieldy Match &amp; More loyalty scheme, and Tesco, which has unveiled a price-matching scheme offering an automatic discount at the till rather than vouchers. Analysts warned that Sparks ran the risk of being too complicated. Sophie McCarthy of retail analysts Conlumino said: \u201cMost of the market is going in the opposite direction, but the core M&amp;S customer has a different profile and, out of most of the major retailers, is probably most likely to engage with the traditional, \u2018local shopkeeper\u2019 feel of the membership club \u2013 as long as they understand it.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Burberry sales hit by Chinese slowdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry blamed a sharp slowdown in sales on a tough global market for luxury goods, in particular weaker demand from Chinese customers. Shares in the FTSE 100 company, known for its British-made trench coats and cashmere scarves, tumbled 8% to a two-year low wiping more than \u00a3500m from Burberry\u2019s stock market value. Shares across the luxury sector were hit, including Prada, Kering and Salvatore Ferragamo. Burberry joins LVMH, which earlier this week became the first major luxury goods company to warn that the stock market collapse in China over the summer had affected sales, particularly at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand. City investors and analysts were disappointed as Burberry said retail revenues were up only 2% to \u00a3774m in the most recent six months. Analysts had expected sround \u00a3818m. Comparable sales over the first three months of the period were up 6%, but slumped by 4% in the second quarter. The company said pretax profit was now expected to be \u201cbroadly in line with the average of those analysts who have recently updated forecasts\u201d or \u00a3445m. That figure was below the previous average forecast of \u00a3460m, but Carol Fairweather, Burberry\u2019s finance chief insisted that the dip was not a profit warning. Fairweather said: \u201cThe slowdown is macro. It has been driven by consumer sentiment.\u201d She pointed to the Chinese stock market turmoil, yuan devaluation and slowing economic growth. She added: \u201cThe Chinese customer is still travelling and shopping.\u201d She explained that the Chinese were now going to Japan and mainland Europe to shop, rather than Hong Kong and the UK, which has been hampered by the pound\u2019s strength against the euro. China\u2019s economic slowdown has prompted fears over the global economy. The country\u2019s stock markets have seen repeated bouts of panic selling this summer, with \u201cBlack Monday\u201d sending world markets into a spin. This prompted Beijing to take unprecedented measures to stop the rout, including the biggest devaluation of the yuan in 20 years, to help exporters and boost the flagging economy. Burberry\u2019s sales in mainland China and Asia-Pacific fell in the six months to the end of September. The region makes up 40% of Burberry\u2019s revenues. Sales at established stores in Japan rose by 50% from a low base. But Burberry missed out on Chinese shoppers\u2019 dash to the country as it closed hundreds of small outlets after buying back out its long-term licensee. The brand is moving upmarket from its traditional position in Japan, bringing in luxury products and a retail image in line with the rest of the world. The company has six standalone stores and 29 concessions at present. It plans to open a further 10 by 2020 and up to 40 new concessions. Fairweather said Burberry was \u201cjust at the beginning of a journey\u201d. In Hong Kong, sales crashed more than 20% in the second quarter, but Fairweather insisted that all of Burberry\u2019s stores there were still profitable. UK fashion chain Ted Baker has also taken a hit in China and Hong Kong, saying visas were being restricted for people coming from the mainland. Anusha Couttigane, senior consultant at Conlumino, said: \u201cWeakening consumer sentiment, especially since the crash of the Chinese market during the summer, has transformed a once booming region into Burberry\u2019s chief area of concern.\u201d Christopher Bailey, chief executive and chief creative officer, said he hoped that Burberry\u2019s plans for the festive season \u2013 Christmas and Lunar New Year in China and Korea \u2013 would return it to a \u201cmore positive sales trend in the all-important second half\u201d. The company has stepped up efforts to cut costs by \u00a320m to minimise the impact on this year\u2019s profits, which include a hiring freeze outside its retail operations. The company will highlight its traditional scarves in a new advertising film for Christmas \u2013 after successfully generating publicity for its trenchcoats with last year\u2019s ad featuring Romeo Beckham. Burberry also hopes to generate growth from a move into selling make-up and perfumes including Brit Splash and My Burberry eau de toilette. In the US, sales slowed in the past three months, while the rest of the Americas experienced double-digit growth in the past six months. Europe was another bright spot: comparable sales were up more than 20% in Italy, France and Spain which significantly outperformed the UK. The company opened 14 standalone stores and 16 concessions in the past six months, including a new flagship store in Tokyo along with shops in Seoul, New York and Dubai. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm World First, said: \u201cIf the devaluation of the yuan and the weakness of Chinese and emerging market economies were the first shoe to drop, then the slowing of demand and sales for luxury retailers like Burberry is surely the next. \u201cBurberry is in an interesting position as a result of its international expansion with exposure to some of the most volatile currencies out there; everyone is focused on the yuan but the moves in the Russian rouble, South Korean won and the euro will have made trading conditions very difficult.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned major banks they could be required to hold \u00a33.3bn of extra capital as a result of proposals to separate high street banking from riskier investment banking operations. The total figure for the six banks affected \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, the UK arm of the Spanish bank Santander and Co-operative Bank \u2013 was released on Thursday in two consultation papers published by Threadneedle Street. In a move intended to give banks more clarity about how to implement the ringfencing rules devised by Sir John Vickers in 2011, the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) set out the circumstances in which the high street operations can pay dividends back to the investment banking arm. This is likely to provide some comfort to banks such as HSBC, which is considering moving its headquarters from the UK because of the tougher regulatory environment. Tim Dolan, a partner in the financial regulation team at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons, said: \u201cThe ringfenced banks will need to hold significant capital as buffers to protect themselves against any downturn. The PRA propose(s), however, permitting ringfenced banks to pay dividends to their parent companies as long as the PRA is informed and the payments will not harm their stability or resilience.\u201d The aim of the proposals is to allow the ring fenced bank - holding customer deposits and the operation of cash machines - to survive separately from the investment bank. Banks have been seeking clarity on what this means in practice for the operation between the two arms. There has been uncertainty about whether the ringfenced arm of a bank and its investment bank could cross sell products. The consultation paper says they can, as long as long as the ringfenced bank is not reliant on the income. The banks have yet to be told precisely how much extra capital they will need to hold as a result of the implementation of the Vickers proposals, because the figure contained in the latest documents only relates to the treatment of one small part of their businesses. They will have to wait until next year for more clarity on this area. The \u00a33.3bn additional capital is less than 1% of their existing capital bases. Implementing the moves recommended by Vickers, who chaired the Independent Commission on Banking for the coalition government, is expected to add about 5% to banks\u2019 running costs. Threadneedle Street said a bank with \u00a34bn operating costs would face a \u00a3200m one-off cost and continuing costs of \u00a3120m a year. Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank, said: \u201cMaking our firms more resilient has been at the forefront of our post-crisis agenda. Today represents an information step forward in achieving this aim. We have provided clarity for affected banks on how we will implement ringfencing and this will enable firms to take substantial steps forward in their preparations for structural reform.\u201d At a time when Barclays appears to be preparing to put a fresh emphasis on its investment bank with the expected appointment of the investment banker Jes Staley as chief executive, politicians are pointing to the ringfence as crucial protection for high street bank customers. The current consultation runs until January, although further consultation will still be needed before the final deadline for implementation at the start of 2019.",

      "bodyText": "Nine out of 10 Volkswagen drivers in Britain affected by the diesel emissions scandal believe they should receive compensation, increasing the pressure on the carmaker as it attempts to recover from the crisis. Almost 1.2m diesel vehicles in Britain are involved in the scandal, out of 11m worldwide, and VW faces a hefty bill if it is forced to make payouts to motorists. The company has put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to deal with the cost of recalling and repairing the affected vehicles, but it also faces the threat of fines and legal action from customers and shareholders. There is a growing frustration among VW drivers in the UK over the lack of information about how their vehicle will be repaired, according to the consumer watchdog Which?. VW has sent letters to affected customers, arriving this week. However, the letters state that the company is still working on its plans and another letter will be sent when these are confirmed. Paul Willis, the managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Monday that the recall of vehicles may not be completed by the end of 2016 and that it was premature to discuss compensation. However a survey by Which? has found that nine out of 10 affected motorists want compensation. Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, said: \u201cMany VW owners tell us they decided to buy their car based on its efficiency and low environmental impact, so it\u2019s outrageous that VW aren\u2019t being clear with their customers about how and when they will be compensated. \u201cVolkswagen UK must set out an urgent timetable for redress to the owners of the affected vehicles. We also need assurances from the government that it is putting in place changes to prevent anything like this happening again.\u201d In the wake of the scandal, 86% of VW drivers are concerned about the environmental impact of their car, while 83% questioned the impact on its resale value and 73% feared the performance of their vehicle would be affected. More than half of the VW customers said they had been put off from buying a VW diesel car in the future. A total of 96% stated that fuel efficiency was an important factor in buying the diesel vehicle, while 90% said it was the seemingly limited environmental impact. Both these issues are affected by the scandal. Which? surveyed more than 2,000 motorists who bought a VW diesel car between 2008 and 2015. In further developments, VW has admitted that US regulators are examining an additional piece of suspect software in its 2016 diesel vehicles. The \u201cauxiliary emissions control device\u201d heats up a pollution control catalyst faster, boosting the performance of the device that separates nitrogen oxide into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases. A VW spokesman confirmed that the company reported the device last week to the Environmental Protection Agency, which discovered the initial defeat device that allowed the company to cheat emissions tests. The regulator is now considering whether to approve the device or if it is another defeat device, designed specifically to manipulate the performance of the vehicle during tests. VW\u2019s new 2016 models cannot be sold until they are approved by regulators and thousands of vehicles remain marooned in ports as a result. In a separate setback, the company also confirmed that the executive earmarked to become boss of VW in North America has left the company. Winfried Vahland, the head of the VW-owned Skoda brand, was due to become head of a newly formed North America arm, bringing together its businesses in the US, Canada and Mexico. Vahland would have led the company\u2019s fightback in the US alongside Michael Horn, the head of VW in the US. However, the company said Vahland was leaving due to \u201cdiffering views on the organisation of the new group region\u201d. VW insisted his departure was not linked to the emissions crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The pace of retail store closures across the UK has plummeted to the lowest level for five years, according to new figures from PwC. Stores are still closing on the high street as shopping habits change but in the first six months of the year, they closed at the rate of 14 a day \u2013 the lowest figure since 2010 \u2013 according to data compiled for PwC by the Local Data Company. The rate of closure peaked at 20 stores a day in the first six months of 2012. However, the PwC study published on Thursday shows there was a net reduction (openings minus closures) of 437 shops during the first half of this year, which represents an increase when compared with the same period in 2014, which showed a net reduction of 406 shops. Coffee shops, charity shops, takeaways, jewellers, healthfood shops and computer games outlets all did well in terms of new shops opening, the statistics show. Mark Hudson, retail partner at PwC, said that new businesses occupying the high street were more likely to be leisure or services based. He said that healthfood shops were thriving whereas payday lending, for example, was suffering. Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company, said: \u201cAs ever, the devil is in the detail. We are seeing the continuing decline of pubs and clothing shops whilst seeing previously expansive sectors such as banks, betting shops and cheque cashing all in retreat from the high street.\u201d Hudson said: \u201cOnline sales growth is slowing and consumer spending is increasing so the dramatic impact on store numbers of the double whammy of channel shift and fewer store visits is abating for now and we are returning to a more natural level of churn. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear though is that a tidal wave of change is still washing through the high street and that consumer shopping behaviour means we\u2019re not going back to the traditional high streets of the past.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Greens will attempt to bring Volkswagen executives in front of MPs to answer questions about the emissions scandal as the government ponders its options to tighten Australia\u2019s vehicle emissions standards. VW Australia has announced a voluntary recall of its cars fitted with software that cheats emissions tests. More than 77,000 VW and Skoda models, and 14,000 Audi vehicles, have the software. The Greens have used the international scandal engulfing VW to resurrect a private member\u2019s bill that would toughen up Australia\u2019s vehicle emissions standards. The party will also press the Senate environment and communications committee to call VW executives to answer questions. \u201cAustralian consumers want VW to be held to account as this is potentially a breach of consumers laws, but tragically it won\u2019t be a breach of fuel efficiency laws as we don\u2019t have any,\u201d said Greens senator Larissa Waters. \u201cWe\u2019re worried that Australia will become a dumping ground for VW\u2019s non-efficient vehicles because of our low standards. We also want to ask them what redress they will provide to consumers and if any recall will involve a software fix or a more extensive retrofit.\u201d The motor vehicle standards (cheaper transport) bill was created by the Greens last year. It would set a limit of 130g of carbon dioxide per kilometre travelled up to 2020, dropping to 95g CO2/km after that. The move, the Greens say, would bring Australia into line with European standards and save drivers $850 a year on petrol because of improved efficiency. Australia has vehicle emissions standards around harmful particulates such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide but does not have any regulations around heat-trapping gases such as CO2 that contribute to climate change. This contrasts to standards in Europe, the US, Korea and China. European Union nations and China have been progressively tightening rules around the amount of CO2 cars are permitted to expel. There is in-principle support from both the Coalition and Labor for improved vehicle emissions standards as a way to tackle climate change without getting into politically difficult taxes or emissions trading systems. A taskforce within the industry department is looking at ways to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. \u201cReducing Australia\u2019s vehicle emissions and increasing fuel efficiency is a priority for the government,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister. \u201cThe government will examine further actions and will announce these shortly. It is important that we look at air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency of vehicles in a holistic manner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The news came on Wednesday that Westpac was raising its standard variable home loan rate by 20 basis points. It had been expected and demonstrates yet again that when the choice comes between profits and customers, banks will always choose profits. It takes a fair bit of gall for a bank to announce it will be forcing home owners to pay about $45 a month more on an average home loan of $350,000, at the same time it announces its profits rose 6% over the previous year. But banks are not known for lacking gall. On Wednesday, Westpac announced its standard variable home loan rate would rise from 5.48% to 5.68% and that its unaudited net profit for 2014-15 was $8,012m \u2013 up 6% on the previous year \u2013 and that cash earnings rose 3% to $7.82bn. It also announced that it was raising $3.5bn through a discounted share issue to shareholders, which was being done in order to boost its capital reserves. Westpac\u2019s reason for the increase in interest rates was put down to the increase in its capital reserves required under new regulations instituted by the financial regulator Apra. In July, Apra announced the banks needed to increase the amount of capital they held relative to their mortgage loans. The new regulations meant that \u201cthe average risk weight on Australian residential mortgage exposures will increase from approximately 16% to at least 25%\u201d. In effect this meant that banks need to hold more capital, which doesn\u2019t bring in profit relative to loans, which do. The reason Apra brought in these new regulation is that loans are risky, and holding a higher ratio of capital in effect makes the banks safer should a housing collapse occur and suddenly they have a lot more dud loans on their books. The recommendations for this came out of the Murray financial system inquiry and were first mooted late last year. And as soon as they were mooted, banks began saying it would lead to higher mortgage rates. In November last year the former Westpac CEO, Gail Kelly, spoke to the cost of holding a greater share of capital that \u201ceither we price for that cost (ie take lower profits) or pass it on (ie to customers)\u201d. Well gee, what a tough choice for the bank. I am guessing they thought long and hard about what to do. Westpac announced on Wednesday that that along with its 6% increase in profits, it was also passing on a final dividend of 94 cents a share \u2013 up 2 cents a share on last year. Thus rather than cut or keep dividends steady, it is passing the costs of the new regulations on to the customers through higher loan rates. This is a big deal in the economy given Westpac is the second biggest home loan lender. And given the big four banks \u2013Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and NAB \u2013 hold about 82% of all home loans held by banks, there is a very big chance the other three will follow: One of the problems with our banking system is that the four very profitable banks absolutely dominate the market \u2013 and dominate it in a way they haven\u2019t for a very long time: The GFC saw the end of small lenders \u2013 destroyed by the massive explosion in short-term lending costs on overseas markets: In the fallout, rather than support the small banks, the Rudd government allowed Westpac to buy St George, Bank of South Australia and RAMS; the Commonwealth Bank to buy BankWest and a third of Aussie Home Loans; and NAB to buy the mortgage broker Challenger. It was a nice consolidation period for the big banks, and the government helpfully guaranteed deposits up to $1m for free and charged a sliding scale for deposits over that amount. It made the banks a very safe place to keep your money during a pretty scary time. Their funding costs certainly went up as the fight for banks to get the money via term deposits saw those interest rates rise well above the cash rate. Before the GFC, banks got about 40% of their funding via domestic term deposits (ie Australians depositing money in banks which banks lent to other people), now it accounts for nearly 60%. From 2010 through 2013 the cost of this funding was significantly higher than it had been prior to the GFC, but it has since fallen: On the other side of the ledger, the sharp increase in funding costs during the GFC led to banks raising their mortgage rates by more than did the Reserve Bank, and then later not dropping them as much when the RBA began cutting: Before the GFC the standard variable home loan was between 135 to 145 basis points higher than the cash rate. By the end of 2013 it was 305 basis points higher, and last month it was up to 325 points. The rise by Westpac and the likely follow by other banks will widen this gap further. And what this all means is that the gap between what banks give us for term deposits and what we pay them for a mortgage is now wider than it has been at any time this century: Little wonder that despite the RBA cutting interest rates in the past year, Westpac was able to declare that its net interest margin was steady at 2.08%. It should be noted that Westpac also announced on Wednesday that it would raise the term deposit rate by 25 basis points. But in the wash-up, what we have is banks passing on the costs of regulations to consumers \u2013 and blaming the government, even though the government has been extremely good for the banks over the past decade. The irony is that the new regulations will make the banks more secure and thus less of funding risk, which will in turn reduce their funding costs. On a broader scale, the Westpac rate rise, plus other reductions in discount rates from other banks over the past few months, has in effect cancelled out the two RBA rate cuts. It has also increased the likelihood of the RBA cutting rates sooner should it believe the economy needs another push \u2013 Westpac\u2019s move saw the likelihood of a rate cuts on Melbourne Cup day increase from 22% to 31%. But regardless of rate cuts, be sure that the cost of any moves to make banks more secure \u2013 which will benefit not only them but the whole economy in the future \u2013 will be borne mostly by bank customers rather than bank shareholders.",
