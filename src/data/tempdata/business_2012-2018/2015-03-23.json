    "webTitle": "Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel hold press conference after debt talks - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel is an old hand at this eurozone crisis - and that press conference was an object lesson in sticking to Germany\u2019s position without sounding too unreasonable. And there were signs of goodwill between the two leaders, at times anyway. Merkel\u2019s key message, swiftly tweeted by spokesman Steffen Seibert, is that the talks took place in a spirit of trust and cooperation [original translation corrected after kind reader feedback] The chancellor did express sympathy for Greece - telling reporters: \u201cWe want Greece to be strong economically, we want Greece to grow and above all we want Greece to overcome its high unemployment.\u201d The press conference was dogged by the issue of war reparations, with Tsipras saying that it remains a moral issue. The chancellor, as expected, insists that the matter is closed politically and legally -- but did acknowledge the horrors which Greece suffered: Merkel remains keen to leave responsibility for Greece\u2019s debt talks with the Eurogroup of finance ministers. They must decide whether the Greek government\u2019s reform plan is good enough. She\u2019s not about to start marking Alexis Tsipras\u2019s homework, in other words - even though she has the ultimate power within the German government. So what about the Greek leader? Tsipras said that the objective today was to establish common ground. Impossible to say from here whether that\u2019s been achieved. Today\u2019s meeting may simply be about building a better relationship, after months of point-scoring. As Tsipras put it: It is better to talk with one another than about one another.\u201d Tsipras did react well by defending Merkel when the Nazi issue came up -- saying that Spiegel\u2019s front-cover showing Merkel among the Nazis in Athens was \u201cextremely unfair to the chancellor, and to Germany\u201d. That puts weight behind his argument that Europe must end the stereotypes of lazy Greeks and Nazi Germans. Merkel heeded that spirit of togetherness when she said: Although there are 80 million people living in Germany and we are the biggest economy in the European Union, this Europe is built on the principle that each country is equally important - no matter how many residents it has. But, it\u2019s not clear that any progress has actually been made towards unlocking bailout funds for Greece before it runs out of cash, perhaps in two weeks. Don\u2019t despair, though, the leaders are sitting down to a working dinner now. We\u2019re unlikely to hear from Merkel and Tsipras again tonight, but I\u2019ll keep this liveblog open in case there are developments.... In the meantime, thanks for reading and for all the comments... GW Greek politicians were quick to dismiss any sense that real progress had been made at today\u2019s talks (reports Helena Smith from Athens). Alexis Tsipras\u2019 meeting with Angela Merkel may have been an ice-breaker and put relations between the two leaders on a firmer footing, but the Greek prime minister had failed to extract any promises from the German chancellor, or more importantly, funding to cover the looming credit crunch. \u201cI hope I am wrong, but I don\u2019t think the meeting went well,\u201d said conservative MP and former health minister Andonis Georgiadis. \u201cMrs Merkel, of course, couldn\u2019t say I will give you money as that is the job of creditors but she could have said \u2018I am much more optimistic after these talks\u2019 and she didn\u2019t.\u201d But the Greek media was clearly enthused that the German chancellor said Berlin would not \u201cignore\u201d the issue of Nazi war reparations [even though she also said it is legally and politically resolved]. Many commentators described the move as a clear break with the past. Under a banner headline, Ta Nea quoted Merkel as saying: \u201cWe want to collaborate in the best way and with mutual respect.\u201d Analysts, however, warned that the end game was now in sight for Greece. Either Athens\u2019 leftist-led government moved ahead immediately with modernising reforms that would unlock international aid, or Athens would default \u201cwithin weeks,\u201d they said. \u201cThe end game is coming, don\u2019t be fooled by these niceties,\u201d political science professor Dimitris Keridis told the Guardian. \u201cNot a single euro is being disbursed by Europe. In the next few weeks Greece will default unless it enacts reforms immediately.\u201d Alexis Tsipras (or his media team), have just tweeted that the Greek PM was \u2018incredibly moved\u2019 by the solidarity demo outside the German chancellery. That rally included Germans carrying banners reading \u201cGermany loves Greece\u201d, and even a kissing marathon (I added some photos earlier in the liveblog) If you missed the press conference, highlights start at 5.31pm GMT. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: And here\u2019s that handshake: And that\u2019s it. Angela Merkel thanks the press for coming, and the two leaders then pose for photos with a genuinely friendly-looking handshake. They\u2019ve now headed off for their working dinner; a chance to establish the common ground that Alexis Tsipras says is vital to solving the crisis. An upbeat-sounding Tsipras says that today\u2019s meeting could be the first stage in a \u2018new relationship\u2019 between Greece and Germany. Alexis Tsipras leaps to Angela Merkel\u2019s defence at the next question, about Der Spiegel\u2019s front page showing the chancellor superimposed alongside Nazi officers outside the Acropolis (there\u2019s a copy here). Such caricatures are wrong and unjust, he says. Angela Merkel is a very positive person who wants to listen and exchange ideas. All Europeans are equal, says Angela Merkel - and Germany has an interest in having good relations with all member states including Greece. We\u2019re hearing a lot about the second world war... Chancellor Merkel adds that she and Alexis Tsipras spoke about the \u201cFuture Fund\u201d today. That\u2019s an initiative created last year to fund socio-economic co-operation and build better relations between the two countries. Merkel also acknowledges the suffering of Greece during the second world war: The next question is on Greece\u2019s demand for war reparations. Alexis Tsipras replies that no-one in the Greek government intends to start confiscating German assets in Greece (as was reported last week). Our demands for reparations are not \u2018material\u2019, he says, and in any case the issue should not be linked to the negotiations over Greece\u2019s debt problem. Then Angela Merkel speaks, and is pretty clear -- in Germany\u2019s view, the issue of war reparations is already resolved. Onto the Question and Answer section.... What progress has been made today, and was Angela Merkel convinced by Greece\u2019s proposals? Angela Merkel cautions that no-one should expect a result on Greece\u2019s reform programme at today\u2019s meeting. Tsipras says that he and Merkel are both looking for a solution that benefits both Greece and the rest of Europe. We must avoid creating new divisions in Europe, Tsipras adds. European treaties must be respected, says Tsipras. And Greece will meet its commitments, but with one important condition -- there must also be social justice. Alexis Tsipras turns to fixing the mistakes of the past. Greece needs a new policy mix, he tells the press conference, including big structural reforms to fight tax evasion and corruption. And he calls for co-operation to fight corruption. Social inequality has grown in Greece, says Tsipras, touching on the humanitarian crisis that grips the country. But it would be wrong to simply blame foreigners. There are also internal reasons for Greece\u2019s plight. We must remove the stereotypes that Greeks are lazy, and also that Germans are to blame for the debt crisis. Tsipras wins the prize for understatement of the day, telling the assembled press that Greece has not been a success story since its first bailout in 2010. Tsipras remembers his manners, saying he would like to thank chancellor Merkel for giving him the chance to exchange views on the future of Europe. Now Tsipras is speaking -- saying that today\u2019s meeting is helping the two leaders to understand each other better. Merkel adds that Greece needs structural reforms and a solid budget, as the foundations for a return to growth. We want Greece to be strong, pledges Merkel, with its economy growing and unemployment falling. It\u2019s not up to Germany to evaluate Greece\u2019s reform bill, says Merkel - that\u2019s the role of the entire eurogroup (finance ministers from across the eurozone). Germany and Greece have close ties, Merkel says. Many Greek people live in Germany, and millions of Germans enjoy holidays in Greece. Angela Merkel is speaking first, explaining that she and Alexis Tsipras have discussed issues related to the whole eurozone, as well as bilateral issues. Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have just emerged from their talks to hold a press conference in the Berlin chancellery. It\u2019s being streamed live here (right-click to open in a new window). We may need to brush up on our German and Greek.... Another snap from this afternoon\u2019s meeting: And here\u2019s a photo from the meeting, which is taking place right now: Angela Merkel has shown Alexis Tsipras around the government offices, complete with a rather fine clock. That clock could be a reminder that time is running out, guys.... Alexis Tsipras didn\u2019t get special treatment on his flight from Athens, it appears: Journalists are gathering in Berlin ready to hear from Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras. I thought the press conference didn\u2019t start for another 50 minutes - perhaps it\u2019s going to be earlier..... Here\u2019s a video clip of Greece\u2019s anti-austerity prime minister being loudly serenaded down the red carpet by a German military band, on his way to push for debt assistance and war reparations..... Mario Draghi continues to field questions in the European Parliament, but he\u2019s changed hats - he\u2019s now there as head of the European Systemic Risk Board. He has just told MPs that Greek banks are solvent \u2018at present\u2019, and denied that there is a systemic risks within the eurozone any more. We\u2019ve also learned a new word: Tonight\u2019s meeting between Merkel and Tsipras probably won\u2019t yield a breakthrough on Greece\u2019s funding problems, but it might help the two leaders build a better relationship. As Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence writes: Merkel is eager to avoid the political solution Tsipras desires; she has no interest in circumventing the more technical institutions such as the ECB and the Eurogroup. The meeting will at best help both leaders to improve their personal relationship \u2013 which might turn out to be crucial in the coming weeks in which Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone will be at stake. If anything, tonight\u2019s working dinner might provide both sides a chance to come closer to a deal on reparations for German atrocities committed in Greece during WWII. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has closed at a new record high; up 15 points at 7037. Greek insiders say Tsipras will almost certainly include privatisations in the list of reforms he will propose to Merkel tonight. However, there may be conditions which potential buyers could baulk at. Athens correspondent Helena Smith has the story: The radical left leader is expected to say he will agree to sell-offs as long as the Greek public sector maintains management control over assets. One well-placed source says: \u201cThe prime minister will say the Greek government has to be in charge of structural reforms and not any other body outside of Greece.\u201d Ahead of tonight\u2019s meeting, EU commission president spokesman Margaritis Schinas has said that the time for talks is over. Creditors now want to see specific reforms. he told the Greek daily Kathimerini. \u201cThe Greek side is expected to work fast and to immediately present a list with concrete reforms,\u201d said Schinas who ironically is Greek, adding; \u201cThe time for statements is over, now is the time for work.\u201d The two leaders reviewed an honour guard during the welcoming ceremony at the chancellery in Berlin: Welcome to Berlin, Alexis.... And here\u2019s Alexis Tsipras -- he\u2019s been greeted by Angela Merkel and the pair are now heading into the chancellery. Another shot of Angela Merkel waiting for the arrival of the Greek prime minister at the chancellery in Berlin... The red carpet is down, the military are assembled....and Angela Merkel is ready to receive Alexis Tsipras in Berlin. Optimism among eurozone citizens has hit an eight-year high, in another signal that Europe\u2019s economy is picking up. Consumer confidence rose to -3.0, Eurostat reports, up from -6.7 in February. Angela Merkel has just arrived at the chancellery, reports Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews, unhampered by those demonstrators. The Greek stock market has finished the day up 3%, as Athens traders clung onto their early optimism. Bank shares jumped around 10%. That could swiftly unwind tomorrow, though, if there is no progress in Berlin tonight. Germany\u2019s left wing Die Linke party are also taking part in the demonstration outside the Berlin chancellery: A crowd has gathered outside the Chancellery in Berlin, as Angela Merkel prepares to meet Alexis Tsipras. But they\u2019re not protesting against Greece. This is a rally for \u2018good German Greek cooperation\u2019, with banners reading \u201cGermany loves Greece. But can Merkel and Tsipras match this spirit of camaraderie? We\u2019ll find out in a few hours time.... Mario Draghi has slapped down claims that the European Central Bank is blackmailing Greece, during his session in Brussels. An MEP criticised the ECB for dropping the waiver that allowed it to accept Greek debt as collateral, and for not including Greece in its QE programme. Draghi swept this idea aside; pointing out that the ECB has provided more than \u20ac100bn of euros to Greece. No pressure, Alexis and Angela, but the world\u2019s financial markets are hoping for some progress this week over Greece\u2019s debt woes. As Ed Atkins, Treasury strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut, put it to Reuters: \u201cThis is an incredibly important week for Greece. The level of anxiety could run high but there is still optimism there will be a resolution between Greece and its creditors.\u201d Draghi adds that the ECB would willingly restore the waiver that allowed it to accept Greek sovereign debt as security. But first, it must be confident that Greece\u2019s bailout review will conclude successfully. Back at the European Parliament, Mario Draghi has defended the ECB\u2019s handling of the Greek crisis (having recently refused to accept Greek bonds as collateral for loans). We\u2019re simply following the rules, he says. (that And here\u2019s how Draghi summed up the state of play in the euro area: \u201cGrowth is gaining momentum. The basis for the economic recovery in the euro area has clearly strengthened. This is due to in particular the fall in oil prices, the gradual firming of external demand, easy financing conditions driven by our accomodative monetary policy, and the depreciation of the euro.\u201d Alexis Tsipras has arrived at Berlin-Tegel airport. He was then swiftly swept to a hotel in Berlin, by a phalanx of motorbikes, ready for his meeting with Angela Merkel in around 90 minutes time [see earlier preview]. European central bank chief Mario Draghi is testifying to the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee now. Draghi began by telling MEPs that Europe\u2019s economy is recovering, reiterating that the ECB now expects inflation to rise to 1.5% in 2016. He says that the low oil price, and the weaker euro, is helping. He says that lower funding costs for banks are starting to influence the cost of borrowing for households and companies, just as demand for credit also picks up. And Draghi repeats his usual mantra that monetary policy cannot fix the crisis on its own. Other players, such as politicains, must deliver their own contribution to put the economy back on track. The session is being streamed live, here. Teneo Intelligence analyst Wolfango Piccoli reckons Alexis Tsipras hasn\u2019t exactly lived up to his pre-election rhetoric: The ever-volatile Greek stock market has jumped by 2% today, suggesting Athens traders are hopeful about tonight\u2019s talks. Greek bank shares are leading the list of top risers, with Eurobank Ergasias jumping 10%. Greece\u2019s finance minister has a fan in Germany, this graffiti suggests: The euro is rallying in the currency markets today. It\u2019s gained 1% against the US dollar today to $1.0921, as currency traders continue to scratch their heads and wonder when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. The euro has also gained 1% against the pound, to 73p, as the looming general election hits sterling. A hung parliament looks more likely by the day: The strength the euro has pushed down the German stock market, with the DAX falling 1.2%. German exporters had been seen as the big winners from the weaker euro, of course. A quick recap. Tension is mounting as Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, heads towards Berlin for his first visit to Angela Merkel this afternoon. They are due to start talks in two and a half-hours time (4pm GMT, or 5pm local time), followed by a press conference. The meeting is overshadowed by concerns that Greece could run out of liquidity in a couple of weeks, if it cannot extract funds from its creditors. The Greek government has confirmed that it has written to Merkel, and other key eurozone figures, warning that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to meet debt repayments without help. Athens is also planning to raise the thorny issue of war reparations, despite Germany insisting that the subject is closed. The German government has cautioned that the meeting will not deliver a new deal on Greece\u2019s debts. But Merkel is keen to hear details of the new economic reform plans which Greece is pulling together. Those plans are crucial if Athens is to persuade its creditors to unlock bailout funds in time. Financial markets are on edge ahead of the meeting. Marc Ostwald, of ADM Investor Services, says: With Tsipras ratcheting up the rhetoric on Greece\u2019s immediate debt woes, the post Merkel Tsipras meeting press conference is likely to be the key focal point for the day.... Greece will clearly not be far away from market thoughts as its cash crunch point nears. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, fears that time is running very short: Tonight, Prime Minister Tsipras has potentially his last chance to convince German Chancellor Merkel that he will ultimately do what it takes to keep Greece in the euro. If he fails to inspire any kind of trust in Berlin, securing the necessary funds to keep going, let alone the inevitable third bail-out in July, while be a fantasy. The meeting dominates the newspapers in Greece and Germany; with the Bild tabloid running a Greek headline, and even coming up with 50 reasons that they like Greece (honest!) . Over in Athens the Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides has just told MEGA TV that the letter Tsipras penned to Merkel \u201cwas one of many\u201d sent to EU officials last week (via Helena Smith) Other recipients included EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and the French president Francois Hollande, he said. That letter, as explained earlier, warned that Greece wouldn\u2019t be able to meet looming debt payments without some help from the European Central Bank and other creditors. Sakellarides told Mega that: \u201cIt didn\u2019t say anything more or less than what we had said the previous week. For anyone who has followed the statements of government officials it is clear that there is a liquidity problem, \u2026 and political initiatives have to be taken.\u201d Sakellarides added that the letter had been dispatched to defend Greek interests. \u2018It\u2019s not a question of its being leaked, its about what this letter says.\u201d Tsipras, he insisted, had raised \u201cexactly\u201d the same points at last Thursday\u2019s mini-summit of EU leaders. The missive was trying to anticipate the worst, Sakellarides noted, denying that the Greek government was essentially blackmailing creditors with the threat of a credit crunch. Bad news for City workers hoping for a glimpse of Yanis Varoufakis tomorrow \u2013 the Greek finance minister has cancelled a planned visit to London. Reuters explains: Varoufakis was due to talk at a conference in London and attend another couple of events but has called the trip off as crucial talks between Greece and its euro zone partners over the country\u2019s need for financial support heat up. Over, in Athens officials are insisting that the potentially explosive issue of war reparations will be on the table at tonight\u2019s talks. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: In the two hours that Alexis Tsipras will have with the German chancellor this afternoon, the neuralgic issue of compensation for Nazi war crimes will be put on the table, officials say. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the main issue, obviously, but it will be addressed,\u201d a senior insider told me. The Greek prime minister has said tonight\u2019s talks \u2013 long-awaited in Athens \u2013 will be all the better not only because they offer a direct point of contact with Europe\u2019s most powerful leader but will be denuded of \u201cthe pressure of negotiations\u201d (or, at least, he hopes). \u201cAnd that is very important because both sides will be able to discuss the important issues plaguing Europe and also [discuss] the upgrading of bilateral relations between the two countries,\u201d Tsipras said in a statement to Kathimerini. Greece\u2019s insistence that Germany has a \u2018moral duty\u2019 to make amends for the damage caused during the Nazi occupation has pushed the issue into the spotlight. And in recent days, some German Social Democrat MPs have said Germany should consider compensating victims in Greece. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry insisted this morning that the war reparations issue \u201cis a closed chapter for us\u201d. But it isn\u2019t going away. This week\u2019s edition of Der Spiegel even shows Angela Merkel stood alongside German troops in Athens, headlined: \u201cHow Europeans see the Germans: The German Ubermacht [superior power]\u201d Reuters has now published Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman\u2019s comments about his afternoon\u2019s meeting with Alexis Tsipras. Steffen Seibert said that the meeting can\u2019t supersede the eurogroup (the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers): \u201cGreece has an agreement with the Eurogroup, not a bilateral one with Germany. So if there is a reform list shortly as Greece has promised, it will be presented to the Eurogroup, not to individual governments.... But that doesn\u2019t mean Merkel and Tsipras won\u2019t discuss the issue: \u201cof course it\u2019s interesting for the chancellor to hear from the Greek prime minister\u2019s mouth what his ideas are\u201d,. German tabloid Bild\u2019s list of \u201c50 reasons we like Greece\u201d is online here. It\u2019s quite the olive branch, with polite nods to Archimedes, Nana Mouskouri, the overthrow of the Greek military government in 1974, the Trojan Horse and its fantastic tourism opportunities (a nice alternative to Italy and Spain). Bild can\u2019t quite resist a jibe, though -- number 50 on the list is Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s luxury retreat, reportedly now available to rent for a mere \u20ac5,000 per week. Government officials in Athens and Berlin are hoping that Merkel and Tsipras can exhibit enough mutual trust to make progress today, says Athens correspondent Helena Smith: Today\u2019s Bild frontpage has caused a stir in Greece, she adds: Germany\u2019s foreign ministry isn\u2019t keen to discuss the issue of war reparations, Reuters adds. GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAYS REPARATIONS ISSUE WITH GREECE IS A CLOSED CHAPTER FOR GERMAN GOVERNMENT Back in Germany, a government spokesman has tried to downplay hopes of a breakthrough at tonight\u2019s talks. Any deal, he says, must come from the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, not between the German and Greek leaders personally. He also confirmed that Angela Merkel received a letter from Alexis Tsipras a few days ago, but wouldn\u2019t say whether Tsipras had warned that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to meet Greece\u2019s debts without more help [as covered earlier]. Reuters has snapped the details: GERMAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS MERKEL DID RECEIVE LETTER FROM GREEK PM DAYS AGO, CANNOT COMMENT ON CONTENT GERMAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK REFORM LIST WILL BE GIVEN TO EUROGROUP NOT TO INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS GERMAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS MEETING BETWEEN MERKEL AND TSIPRAS CANONT REPLACE A SOLUTION WITHIN THE EUROGROUP GERMAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS MERKEL HAS REPEATEDLY SAID NOBODY SHOULD EXPECT A SOLUTION FROM HER MEETING WITH GREEK PM TODAY Ouch. Britain\u2019s factory sector has suffered its biggest drop in export orders in over two years. The CBI\u2019s latest survey of the sector, just released, showed that total orders books were flat in March. The index of new export orders fell to -26, the lowest level since January 2013. The CBI blames the \u2018still subdued\u2019 eurozone, and also the strength of the pound for making exports less competitive. And to complete our paper round-up, Die Zeit reports that Tsipras will present Merkel with some new reform plans today. That could include tax increases on tobacco and alcohol and raising the retirement age. German tabloid Bild has pulled out all the stops for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s visit, starting with a front page which is half printed in Greek! And inside, there\u2019s an article called \u201c50 reasons why we are fond of Greeks\u201d. Bild was heavily criticised last month for encouraging readers to pose for selfies along its campaign against giving \u201cGreedy Greeks\u201d more cash. So today, it\u2019s trying to be helpful -- presenting a thrifty housewife and a young boy who have a proper grip on financial matters: Greece\u2019s Ta Nea newspaper says Athens has reached out to Iran to see if it might help by buying some short-term Greek debt to tide it through the crisis. The structure of today\u2019s meeting is quite interesting. Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras are scheduled to meet around 5pm local time (4pm GMT) and talk for two hours, followed by a press conference to brief the media. They will then head back inside for a working dinner where issues can be hammered out. That dinner gives them more time to address their differences, and make some progress. But it also means they can avoid any full-blown rows until after they\u2019ve faced the press. Both sides at today\u2019s meeting see each other as the bad guy, tweets BBC Europe editor Katya Adler: Greece\u2019s looming cash crunch (see earlier post) means it\u2019s vital that Alexis Tsipras establishes trust with Angela Merkel tonight. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, argues that it could be his last chance to build bridges with the chancellor: The news out of Athens is getting more and more desperate, with the government apparently on track to run out of money in early April Having learned the hard way that Europe cannot be blackmailed, it is difficult for us to understand why Syriza is dragging its feet on implementing the necessary reforms to secure funding and why it subjects the Greek people to deepening economic and financial crisis. Tonight, Prime Minister Tsipras has potentially his last chance to convince German Chancellor Merkel that he will ultimately do what it takes to keep Greece in the euro. If he fails to inspire any kind of trust in Berlin, securing the necessary funds to keep going, let alone the inevitable third bail-out in July, while be a fantasy. Last night\u2019s Andalusian election results may suggest that Podemos is now losing ground, just a year after being founded, argues Berenberg Bank: They writes: Is Podemos\u2019 star sinking already? After beginning to gradually fall in the polls as Spanish media turned their focus on the party\u2019s links with Venezuela, Spain\u2019s Syriza-equivalent Podemos failed miserably to win the election in one of Spain\u2019s worst hit regions. In Andalusia, where unemployment is 34%, the mainstream centre-left Socialists obtained 35.5% (down from 39.5% in 2012), the centre-right Popular Party of Prime Minister Rajoy 26.7% (down from 40.7%) and the upstart liberal party Ciudadanos 9.3%, putting pro-European parties at 71.5% together. By contrast, Podemos only collected 14.9%. In case you missed it....Spain\u2019s anti-austerity party, Podemos, secured third place in regional elections last night. Podemos won 15 seats in the Andalusia parliament, as some voters broke away from the two-party system that\u2019s dominated Spanish politics for many years. That deprived the Socialist party of a majority, but it\u2019s not quite the landmark moment that some Podemos supporters hoped for. The Socialists came first with 47 seats, followed by the centre-right People\u2019s Party with 33 seats. Podemos did surge to victory in one district; C\u00e1diz, where the unemployment rate has hit depression-era levels above 40%. How close is Greece to running out of funds? Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper reported yesterday that Athens has just two weeks to secure fresh aid before the situation becomes \u2018critical\u2019. And that\u2019s because it faces a \u20ac465m repayments to the IMF on April 9, which could be tricky to repay unless its creditors have provided help by then (as Alexis Tsipras urged in his letter to Angela Merkel). Greece faces further payments are due on May and June, and must also \u2018roll over\u2019 billions of euros of short term debt (or bills) each month. This chart from Bruegel shows the hurdles ahead: James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, has predicted this morning that Greece could leave the eurozone. But speaking on CNBC, Bullard also warned it would be a mistake and leave Greeks facing a \u2018bleak\u2019 future. Our Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly, reports that German sentiment towards Greece has soured in recent months, as some lose patience with Athens\u2019 demands for more help. One Berliner, Christiane Schneider, told Kate: \u201cI really don\u2019t know how much longer we should keep patting their backs and telling them everything\u2019s going to be alright \u2013 here\u2019s an extra 100m. If my son kept coming to me for money to get himself out of trouble, I\u2019d help him immediately, but I\u2019d want to see that he was trying to get out of any mess he\u2019d got himself into, wouldn\u2019t I? I couldn\u2019t afford to keep tossing banknotes in his direction.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s calls for war reparations appears to have split Germany; with some resenting the demands, but others acknowledging that it has some merit. Kate writes: Georg Franke, a 57-year-old market-stall holder in Potsdam, said while he believed the Greek government\u2019s behaviour had been \u201cchildish\u201d, he did not find its second world war compensation claims so outlandish. \u201cThe trouble is, Germans know a lot about the atrocities carried out in their name by the Wehrmacht and the SS against the Jews from Germany, Poland and Hungary, as well as the Slavs, but we learnt very little in school about the horrors carried out against the Greeks. It was only recently, around the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, that I saw a documentary which touched on how they [Jewish Greeks] were almost all wiped out and it brought it home to me.\u201d The FTSE 100 index of leading shares has dropped back down to the 7,000 mark in early trading, down 22 points. So no new record high yet. Other European markets have dipped a little too, having hit seven year highs on Friday, as traders fret about the Greek debt crisis. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: It should prove to be another decisive week for Greece as Greek Prime Minister Tsipras is set to meet German Chancellor Merkel. Athens is hoping to improve relations with its biggest EU creditor before announcing a more detailed set of reforms required to unlock the next instalment of aid. Eurozone finance minister could meet again soon, if Greece produces those reforms.... Hajo Funke, political scientist with Berlin\u2019s Free University, says that \u201ctwo worlds will collide\u201d when Merkel and Tsipras sit down this afternoon He explained to AFP that: \u201cThere is the political world of Greece, where a left-wing government faces a society in collapse, (of) societal decay... as grave as anything we have seen in western Europe since 1945.\u201d. \u201cThe other world is a content country that is dominant in Europe, Germany, which worries about maintaining its economic happiness, and which is now being asked to help the other, under conditions it doesn\u2019t fully understand.\u201d German politicians hope that Alexis Tsipras will arrive in Berlin with details of the new reform plans. Thomas Oppermann, parliamentary leader of Merkel\u2019s Social Democrat coalition partners, says Greece must deliver on the pledges made at Thursday night\u2019s mini-summit in Brussels. \u201cI expect [Mr Tsipras] to present this list in his talks with the chancellor on Monday. \u201cI want to know once and for all if Greece is ready to reform or not.\u201d Greek insiders, though, have suggested this list might not be ready until Easter.... Alexis Tsipras has raised the stakes ahead of today\u2019s meeting with Angela Merkel by declaring that Greece cannot meet looming debt repayments without help from its creditors. In a letter sent to Germany last week, Tsipras warned that the lack of bailout funds mean it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to service debt obligations due in the coming weeks (such as debt repayments and publc sector wage bills) He also criticised restrictions imposed by the European Central Bank which prevent Athens issuing more short-term debt to tide itself over. Tsipras urged Merkel not to allow a \u201csmall cash flow issue\u201d to turn into a major crisis. Given that Greece has no access to money markets, and also in view of the \u2018spikes\u2019 in our debt repayment obligations during the Spring and Summer of 2015 (primarily to the IMF), it ought to be clear that the ECB\u2019s special restrictions when combined with the disbursement delays would make it impossible for any government to service its debt obligations. He added that: Servicing these repayments through internal resources alone would, indeed, lead to a sharp deterioration in the already depressed Greek social economy \u2013 a prospect that I will not countenance. It suggests Tsipras will push Merkel hard tonight to unlock some of the \u20ac7.2bn bailout funds which its lenders are holding back, until they see credible reform plans. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel, who published the letter, has analysed the full text here: Tsipras letter to Merkel: the annotated text Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. German MPs laughed last week when Angela Merkel told them she was looking forward to meeting - and perhaps arguing - with her Greek counterpart today. But there may not be too much mirth in Berlin tonight as the chancellor hosts Alexis Tsipras for the first time. The two leaders will meet as concern swirls that Greece could soon run out of cash, unless it can satisfy its creditors. Tsipras has told Greek media that the meeting with Merkel is an opportunity to talk \u201cwithout the pressure of any negotiation\u201d. His officials are busy working on new economic reform plans which will, they hope, finally persuade its creditors to hand over some bailout funds. But the meeting comes after two months of rising tensions between the two countries since Tsipras won power in late January, and began pushing for a new debt deal. His call for war reparations has raised the tensions in Germany too. And back home, Tsipras also faces pressure from hard-line members of his own party who fear he may cave in to eurozone demands. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reported last night: On both sides, the talks are being seen as a \u201cmoment of truth.\u201d Greece has made clear, under its new government, that it does not want to leave the eurozone and Tsipras his point that austerity needs to be eased. In Athens officials are putting on a brave face. \u201cWe are looking forward to this meeting,\u201d said the Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chemistry between the two leaders. It\u2019s much better that they talk directly to one another. But many also fear that in a bid to douse dissent within his own party, Tsipras is trying to buy time hoping that fellow anti-austerians are elected elsewhere in Europe. And that Merkel, bowing to rising anti-Greek sentiment among her own constituency, will also push too hard. The meeting starts in mid-afternoon, with a press conference scheduled before a \u2018working dinner\u2019: Also coming up today, ECB president Mario Draghi is testifying to the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee. Draghi may sound more confident about economic prospects, given recent signs of recovery in the euro area. Stan Shamu of IG says: Given all the measures that have been introduced by the ECB and signs of bottoming in data, there is a good chance Mr Draghi will give a more upbeat assessment of the economy. Draghi\u2019s should also field questions on the Greek crisis, given the ECB is effectively keeping its banks alive with vital liquidity support. Two pieces of economic data to watch out for: 11am GMT: the latest CBI survey of UK industrial trends 3pm GMT: the latest eurozone consumer confidence survey And European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 on track to hit a fresh all-time high after breaking through the 7,000-point mark on Friday. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

His officials are busy working on new economic reform plans which will, they hope, finally persuade its creditors to hand over some bailout funds.</p> <p>But the meeting comes after two months of rising tensions between the two countries since Tsipras won power in late January, and began pushing for a new debt deal. </p> <p>His call for war reparations has raised the tensions in Germany too.</p> <p>And back home, Tsipras also faces pressure from hard-line members of his own party who fear he may cave in to eurozone demands.</p> <p>Athens correspondent Helena Smith reported last night: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On both sides, the talks are being seen as a \u201cmoment of truth.\u201d Greece has made clear, under its new government, that it does not want to leave the eurozone and Tsipras his point that austerity needs to be eased.

It was believed to be the first time a foreign leader had gone to the capital of the reunified Germany to make such a demand. Merkel was uncompromising, while appearing uncomfortable and irritated. \u201cIn the view of the German government, the issue of reparations is politically and legally closed,\u201d she said. While the two leaders clashed over the second world war, there was no sign of any meeting of minds on the substance of their dispute over Greece\u2019s bailout and what Tsipras has to deliver to secure fresh funding and avoid state insolvency within weeks. Two months after winning the election by promising to abolish \u201cMerkelism\u201d \u2013 the harsh austerity ordained by the eurozone and other creditors in return for \u20ac240bn (\u00a3175bn) in bailout loans over the past five years \u2013 Tsipras held to the view that Greece\u2019s crisis was not of his making. He delivered a lengthy diagnosis of what had gone wrong in the last five years, but had next to nothing to say about his own policies except vague references to fighting corruption. And when he raised the corruption issue, he singled out a German company, Siemens, because of its alleged activities in Greece. A stony-faced Merkel reiterated what she had said in Brussels on Friday after a late-night session with Tsipras \u2013 that a 20 February agreement with the eurozone extending Greece\u2019s bailout until the end of June remained the yardstick. That agreement obliges Tsipras to deliver a persuasive menu of detailed fiscal and structural reforms which need to be vetted by the eurozone before any further bailout funding can be released. Asked if she had reached any agreements with Tsipras, Merkel avoided the question and stressed she was only one of 19 eurozone national leaders. Tsipras was believed to have told the German leader that Greece faced insolvency within weeks without the release of more funds, which are being held up because he has failed to produce a coherent policy package. \u201cThe medium-term liquidity problem is well known,\u201d he said. \u201cWe inherited it.\u201d While neither side wants Greece to leave the euro, the lack of agreement in Berlin signalled a digging in of hardline positions on both sides that could result in a major negotiating failure. Support for the Greek government remains strong at home, in inverse proportion to the lack of trust in Tsipras among his main creditors. A growing majority of Germans do not believe Greece will do what it must to stay in the euro and would prefer to see it leave. The Eurasia group risk consultancy on Monday raised its assessment of the chance of Greece having to quit the euro to 30%, up from a previous 20%. \u201cThe prospects of a deal over Greece are diminishing, as Germany, the eurogroup and Greece continue to posture,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, its eurozone analyst. \u201cThe chances of capital controls, and ultimately, Greece\u2019s exit from the euro, are also increasing. While Berlin still wants to keep Greece in the eurozone, it can and will not be flexible regarding the conditions attached to more financial aid.\u201d Late on Thursday and into Friday morning last week, Tsipras met Merkel and the leaders of other key creditors on the fringes of an EU summit in Brussels. He told them that waiting until the end of April for the \u20ac7.2bn remaining to be tapped from the bailout would be too late for Greece. In letters to Berlin and other EU power centres a few days earlier, Tsipras also threatened to default on Greece\u2019s debts without some relief from the eurozone and the European Central Bank. A unilateral default would press the button on Greece leaving the single currency. Facing a cashflow crisis with large loans to repay and running out of funds to service them, Tsipras argued for agreement on a \u201cpolitical framework\u201d with Merkel and other national leaders, bypassing the eurozone technocrats and the eurogroup finance ministers. Merkel is determined to avoid precisely this, pledging that there can be no further release of loans until the Greeks draw up a credible menu of fiscal and structural reforms and prove they are serious about acting on them. In his two months in office, Tsipras has signally failed to do this. His creditors think he is wasting everyone\u2019s time.",

The shares might be impacted by another outcome, such as an \u2018L\u2019 shaped stabilisation.</p> <p>The lack of earnings visibility at Weir today is almost unmatched in ourexperience of the sector (close perhaps to Cookson in 2009). Two major unknowns face Oil &amp; Gas: a plummeting north American active horizontal rig count; and significant price pressure....This downturn appears to have been caused by higher supply at least as much as by lower demand; and so far supply-side response does not appear to be shrinking the production surplus.</p> <p>Weir may be the subject of bid interest.

Bruno Monteyne of Bernstein Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If [former chief executive] Dalton Philips was attending the Morrisons analyst meeting he might have wondered why he was dismissed. It seemed that everything at Morrisons was absolutely fine. Dalton\u2019s plan was the right one, Morrisons key performance indicators were all going in the right direction and the cost saving, working capital and cash flow goals were all still on track. All that was apparently needed was more \u201cfocus, pace and energy\u201d.</p> <p>However the guidance didn\u2019t quite match the rhetoric. We thought the company would do a \u2018kitchen sinking\u2019 margin reset for the new year.</p> <p>We got no explicit margin guidance at all but were handed a puzzle: we got a net debt target and guidance on capex, cash-flow, working capital and asset disposal targets ... with all those targets, there is actually no need to give margin guidance: it can be back-solved!</p> <p>Without too many of us taking notice on the day, they guided earnings before interest and tax margins for next year down to between 1.2% and 2.8% (versus consensus of 2.9%), and down as much as 160 basis points on last year. Another 50% profit drop after last year\u2019s 50% drop seems like a profit warning or kitchen sinking to us.</p> <p>...Morrisons\u2019 problems aren\u2019t going away. It\u2019s still an underperform, price target \u00a31.40.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty </strong>dropped 10.1p to 224.9p ahead of full year results this week, but outsourcer <strong>Serco</strong> added 7p to 187p despite Berenberg moving from hold to sell with a price target cut from 155p to 130p:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A deep corporate renewal programme and a new and highly respected management will not be enough to reverse Serco\u2019s negative share price trajectory, in our view. The new strategy of focusing on the B2G [business to government] business (the one the company originally tried to diversify away from) comes with high execution risk, particularly as the highly competitive UK outsourcing market may itself experience a post-election blip. At the top-line we now model -12% organic growth in 2015 followed by a further 2% contraction in 2016, driven by known contract attrition and a likely contraction in volumes. During 2015 Serco also faces contract renewals worth around 5% of sales and, in our view, this remains an area of potential downside risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market<strong> Verona Pharma</strong> jumped almost 15% to 2.925p after positive clinical trial results for RPL554, its treatment for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.<br></p> <p>Finally Aim-listed <strong>Frenkel Topping</strong>, which provides investment advice for compensation claimants, added 1p to 42p after full year profits rose 12% to \u00a31.6m.

Weir, the pumping equipment specialist, lost 40p to \u00a318.01 as RBC cut its price target from \u00a321.50 to \u00a318.50. The bank said: Weir shares appear to be pricing-in a \u2018V\u2019 shaped second half recovery in the US horizontal rig count. The shares might be impacted by another outcome, such as an \u2018L\u2019 shaped stabilisation. The lack of earnings visibility at Weir today is almost unmatched in ourexperience of the sector (close perhaps to Cookson in 2009). Two major unknowns face Oil &amp; Gas: a plummeting north American active horizontal rig count; and significant price pressure....This downturn appears to have been caused by higher supply at least as much as by lower demand; and so far supply-side response does not appear to be shrinking the production surplus. Weir may be the subject of bid interest. A number of large industrial conglomerates (Siemens, GE, ABB, Emerson, Caterpillar etc) have cash to spend and Weir has strong positions in its markets. UK newspapers reported on March 6 that a bid from a financial buyer was possible. Supermarket group Morrisons, down 0.3p to 206p, apparently issued a \u201cstealth profit warning\u201d with its recent results according to a leading analyst. Bruno Monteyne of Bernstein Research said: If [former chief executive] Dalton Philips was attending the Morrisons analyst meeting he might have wondered why he was dismissed. It seemed that everything at Morrisons was absolutely fine. Dalton\u2019s plan was the right one, Morrisons key performance indicators were all going in the right direction and the cost saving, working capital and cash flow goals were all still on track. All that was apparently needed was more \u201cfocus, pace and energy\u201d. However the guidance didn\u2019t quite match the rhetoric. We thought the company would do a \u2018kitchen sinking\u2019 margin reset for the new year. We got no explicit margin guidance at all but were handed a puzzle: we got a net debt target and guidance on capex, cash-flow, working capital and asset disposal targets ... with all those targets, there is actually no need to give margin guidance: it can be back-solved! Without too many of us taking notice on the day, they guided earnings before interest and tax margins for next year down to between 1.2% and 2.8% (versus consensus of 2.9%), and down as much as 160 basis points on last year. Another 50% profit drop after last year\u2019s 50% drop seems like a profit warning or kitchen sinking to us. ...Morrisons\u2019 problems aren\u2019t going away. It\u2019s still an underperform, price target \u00a31.40. Balfour Beatty dropped 10.1p to 224.9p ahead of full year results this week, but outsourcer Serco added 7p to 187p despite Berenberg moving from hold to sell with a price target cut from 155p to 130p: A deep corporate renewal programme and a new and highly respected management will not be enough to reverse Serco\u2019s negative share price trajectory, in our view. The new strategy of focusing on the B2G [business to government] business (the one the company originally tried to diversify away from) comes with high execution risk, particularly as the highly competitive UK outsourcing market may itself experience a post-election blip. At the top-line we now model -12% organic growth in 2015 followed by a further 2% contraction in 2016, driven by known contract attrition and a likely contraction in volumes. During 2015 Serco also faces contract renewals worth around 5% of sales and, in our view, this remains an area of potential downside risk. Lower down the market Verona Pharma jumped almost 15% to 2.925p after positive clinical trial results for RPL554, its treatment for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Finally Aim-listed Frenkel Topping, which provides investment advice for compensation claimants, added 1p to 42p after full year profits rose 12% to \u00a31.6m. Analysts at the company\u2019s broker Shore Capital expects profits of \u00a32m in 2016 and \u00a32.8m in 2017.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Heathrow airport has a new hi-tech weapon in its battle to win over public support for its long-desired third runway. A small sound laboratory has been set up in central London offering a simulated taste of what a future expanded airport would sound like. Inside, the listener sits surrounded by speakers at floor and ceiling levels, to get a 3D impression of a plane flying overhead, with images also screened. It can be precisely calibrated to time of day, distance from the airport, it can even simulate the effect of sound-insulated windows. With the main factor influencing opposition to a third runway at Heathrow being potential aircraft noise \u2013 particularly for those who live beneath the prevailing west London flight paths \u2013 the simulator has been developed for politicians and local residents to test Heathrow\u2019s claim that noise can be, at the very least, toned down. The Arup Sound Lab, originally created by the engineering firm to help the acoustic design of buildings such as concert halls, was also used to allow residents living along the HS2 route to gauge potential disruption from high-speed trains, even though noise disturbance was a relatively minor concern for many HS2 opponents. In contrast, aircraft noise around Heathrow can be all-encompassing, even conversation-stopping. It most directly affects the London borough of Hounslow, where at peak times planes land every 30 to 40 seconds. Strong feelings against aircraft noise are just as likely to be found further away in more affluent areas such as Richmond than in Hounslow, which has very busy roads and plays host to the airport workers who are much more used to the noise. Richard Greer, Arup\u2019s director in charge of the acoustic programme, says that our perception of background noise is skewed because we rarely experience anything near true silence. Only minutes after I enter the lab, a soundproofed box room, does Greer draw my attention to the fact that a soundtrack is playing. With the soundtrack switched off, the silence is startling. Everyday life is depressingly loud once you realise what true silence sounds like. Greer insists that although Heathrow is paying for the sound lab Arup\u2019s neutrality is maintained because it is key to the engineering firm\u2019s credibility \u2013 plus it is peer-reviewed and laboriously checked. The sound lab\u2019s technicians can replay combinations of aircraft types, times of day, and both present and future scenarios, simulated in two locations: one in Hounslow 1.8 miles east of the airport perimeter, another in Richmond, nearly seven miles away, but both under the flightpath of the southern runway. Matt Gorman, Heathrow\u2019s sustainability director, says: \u201cWe want to give people a realistic and objective experience of what sound levels are like around Heathrow today and what they will be like in the future, to help inform the debate.\u201d So far, a lot of Heathrow\u2019s pledges have had to be taken on trust - even if a new generation of quieter planes has started filling up slots at the airport. Allowing people to experience what the toned-down noise sounds like is clearly something the airport believes will help. \u201cIt\u2019s not about telling you what to think, it\u2019s about presenting information,\u201d says Gorman. Councillors, MPs and high-profile opponents such as John Stewart, of the anti-expansion group Hacan, who chaired the coalition of protesters against the previous third runway plan, have been invited in. In Heathrow\u2019s vision of the future, the airport will be a premium hub with the cleanest and quietest aircraft flocking to use it. Steeper landing approaches on the new runway will allow planes to fly higher for longer, disturbing fewer people in west London. Gorman says Heathrow won\u2019t need to ban noisier planes; they should be phased out within the next seven years \u2013 although a Heathrow noise action plan from 2011 promised they would be gone by 2015. But a measure of the airport\u2019s new-found apparent intent to address the noise issue came in its vastly increased offer last month of up to \u00a3700m for measures to insulate local homes and public buildings. Should the Airports Commission recommend expanding Heathrow, Arup expects to develop a more accessible public version of the lab It is keen for people to come in free of preconceptions, experience the lab for themselves and form their own judgments. But this is what the sound lab simulation suggested to me. The Boeing 787 \u201cDreamliner\u201d, for all the hype about its quieter engines, still makes a lot of noise \u2013 almost as much as the A320 in the simulation. The smaller A320\u2019s whistling sound apparently grates on the ears of residents \u2013 but the 787\u2019s reverberation is not insignificant either. Similarly, the giant A380 is far quieter than the hellish roar of a 747 flying overhead \u2013 but it is still a big plane, making noise. Assuming Heathrow keeps all its pledges \u2013 and the Arup simulation is accurate \u2013 properly installed sound insulation, available to many under the compensation scheme, can vastly reduce the sound compared to standard double glazing, which might be assumed to cut out most noise. Outdoors, when a plane is flying over, there\u2019s little escape. However, the lab also showed that, if properly mitigated \u2013 indoors, with insulation, on a steeper approach \u2013 a 787 or A380 becomes barely audible when coming in to land on an alternate runway. That suggests that any expansion plans must involve giving areas breaks from engine noise: more than anything else, the change of flight path will make a difference for those worst affected. The third runway (potentially) could alleviate it even more, if the pattern of respite can be sustained or guaranteed. There are definite questions to be resolved and guarantees that many would seek: the real-life effectiveness of insulation and its geographical spread; the elimination of noisy planes; and exactly how to spread the pain once hundreds of thousands of extra flights a year from a new runway are factored in. And of course, some would definitely suffer more under the new flight path of that new runway. But SoundLab appears to show that the noise problem is, if far from solved, something that can genuinely be moderated in future years. Remarkably, John Stewart of Hacan \u2013 despite remaining firmly opposed to a third runway \u2013 seems to agree. \u201cIt\u2019s a useful tool to show how quieter planes will impact on local communities. On noise grounds it makes the prospect of a third runway a little less of an issue: what this did show me is that the new generation of planes will be quite a lot quieter than the current planes in the sky. \u201cThere is a residue of mistrust at Heathrow, but my belief is that they now understand and will deliver on whatever commitments they make regarding a third runway. \u201cThe critical question is if they could prove a third runway would lead to more respite for communities than they get today. Then they may be on to a winner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable wants the 350 biggest companies listed in London to adopt targets for female representation in boardrooms and step up efforts to address the \u201cserious deficiency\u201d of women in the most senior corporate jobs. The business secretary has championed a voluntary target set by Lord Davies that 25% of directors on boards of the UK\u2019s 100 biggest companies should be women by 2015. Cable said he would also like to see a target set for the top 350 companies, which would include the next rung of companies below those in the FTSE 100, and include businesses such as Halfords, which has named Jill McDonald as its new boss. Davies is due to publish a progress report on Wednesday, with the last count showing that women held 22.8% of boardroom positions on FTSE 100 companies. Cable said he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d companies would meet the 2015 targets set by Davies for FTSE 100 companies, although there were no guarantees. \u201cWe now need 21 more women to be signed up this year so we are almost at the finishing tape but not quite,\u201d he said recently. Cable\u2019s remarks were revealed as chancellor George Osborne called for more women to train an engineers, as he launched a \u00a312m donation for Imperial College in London to build a new school of engineering. Cable and Davies wrote to all FTSE 350 companies last year asking them to take further steps to promote gender balance, including the appointment of one more woman to their board. But Cable has now said that a voluntary target would be useful for listed companies outside the FTSE 100, where performance has been \u201cless stellar\u201d. \u201cYes I think it would be useful. Metrics are always useful, because they enable you to establish whether you are going forwards or backwards.\u201d Davies decided against setting a 25% target for smaller listed companies, because he felt it was beyond their reach. In the FTSE 250, women hold 17.4% of director positions, up from 7.8% in 2011. Cable insisted that the government\u2019s voluntary approach was working, although he has warned that the European Union could impose mandatory quotas if the 25% target is missed. But the business secretary argued that companies should be aiming much higher than 25% female representation in the boardroom. \u201cWe are a long way off equal representation. This is an area where the government does reasonably well. In my department, which is one of the biggest in Whitehall, in the top board and top 200 managers we have 50-50 representation. There is no reason why companies shouldn\u2019t be in the same position.\u201d Cable said all companies still had \u201ca serious deficiency\u201d of women in the chairmanship role and executive positions \u2013 the chief executive and chief finance officer jobs \u2013 \u201cwhere the real power and decision-making lies\u201d. Recent research by the Guardianshowed there are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies than all the female bosses put together.

Cable said he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d companies would meet the 2015 targets set by Davies for FTSE 100 companies, although there were no guarantees. \u201cWe now need 21 more women to be signed up this year so we are almost at the finishing tape but not quite,\u201d he said recently.</p> <p>Cable\u2019s remarks were revealed as chancellor George Osborne called for more women to train an engineers, as he launched a \u00a312m donation for Imperial College in London to build a new school of engineering.</p> <p>Cable and Davies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/feb/03/vince-cable-women-on-boards\">wrote to all FTSE 350 companies last year</a> asking them to take further steps to promote gender balance, including the appointment of one more woman to their board.

Metrics are always useful, because they enable you to establish whether you are going forwards or backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Davies decided against setting a 25% target for smaller listed companies, because he felt it was beyond their reach. In the FTSE 250, women hold 17.4% of director positions, up from 7.8% in 2011.</p> <p>Cable insisted that the government\u2019s voluntary approach was working, although he has warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/04/cable-women-boardroom-mandatory-quotas\">the European Union could impose mandatory quotas</a> if the 25% target is missed.</p> <p>But the business secretary argued that companies should be aiming much higher than 25% female representation in the boardroom. \u201cWe are a long way off equal representation. This is an area where the government does reasonably well. In my department, which is one of the biggest in Whitehall, in the top board and top 200 managers we have 50-50 representation.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Order books for UK factories have stagnated as the strong pound and the protracted weakness of the eurozone affect demand for British goods overseas. The CBI said in its monthly health check of industry that export order books stood at their lowest in more than two years following a sharp fall in March. Only 10% of manufacturers said their export order books were above normal for the time of year, against 35% who said they were below normal. The balance of -25 percentage points compares with -8 points in February. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the employers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cSluggish export performance seems to be a headache that won\u2019t go away, with a still subdued eurozone and headwinds from a stronger pound. But measures in the budget to support exporters should be a welcome boost for the sector\u2019s longer-term prospects. \u201cWith emerging markets facing a tough time and uncertainty continuing to hang over the eurozone, firms are having to work even harder for opportunities to sell their products and services around the world.\u201d The CBI industrial trends survey is the latest piece of evidence to suggest that the economy is growing less quickly than it was in the second half of 2014. Overall, order books fell from a balance of +10 points in February to zero in March, while fewer companies said they had expanded output in the past three months. Stocks of unsold goods increased. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cLooking ahead, it is clear that exporters will struggle to make headway given sterling\u2019s appreciation and the weakness of demand in the eurozone. \u201cIndeed, note that sterling has risen by almost 8% since the start of the year against the euro. But, with lower oil prices set to continue to provide a boost to manufacturers through lowering their input costs and the domestic recovery to maintain a robust pace, we still expect growth in manufacturing output to regain some momentum over the coming quarters.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Economics, said the CBI survey was disappointing, although the weakness was concentrated on export demand. \u201cThe outlook for manufacturers should remain decent on the domestic demand front, although they will be wary that any sustained political uncertainty around May\u2019s general election could hamper activity. Elevated consumer confidence, markedly improved consumer purchasing power and rising employment should underpin demand for consumer durable goods.\u201d \u201cOn the export front, UK manufacturers will be fervently hoping that the eurozone can build on recent signs of improving growth and this increasingly translates into increasing demand for UK manufactured goods.\u201d The problems in shifting the UK economy to export-led growth were further highlighted as the head of the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog was questioned by MPs about its forecast for the public finances. The Office for Budget Responsibility made radical changes to its public finances outlook last week after the chancellor George Osborne used his pre-election budget to scrap plans that would have meant the biggest squeeze on public spending since the 1930s by the end of this decade. The chancellor plans deeper cuts in the nearer term, which, along with a windfall from the sales of some government assets, will allow him to increase spending in 2019-20. Osborne made it clear in his final budget before the election that his record on the deficit and credentials as a safe pair of hands to steer the economy forward would be a key battleground in the runup to the polls in May. The OBR predicts day-to-day public spending on public services will be \u00a328.5bn higher for 2019-20 than it had pencilled in at the time of the autumn statement in December. But it is warning this will mean a tighter squeeze on spending until 2018-19. The chancellor has rejected the OBR\u2019s assessment that there will be a rollercoaster of deep cuts in the next Parliament. Questioned by MPs, Robert Chote, the OBR chairman, defended the organisation\u2019s analysis: \u201cIf you carry out this exercise, it shows in 2017-18 and 2018-19 larger real cuts year on year.\u201d Chote said the OBR had improved transparency about public finances analysis since its creation five years ago.",

Stocks of unsold goods increased.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cLooking ahead, it is clear that exporters will struggle to make headway given sterling\u2019s appreciation and the weakness of demand in the eurozone.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, note that sterling has risen by almost 8% since the start of the year against the euro. But, with lower oil prices set to continue to provide a boost to manufacturers through lowering their input costs and the domestic recovery to maintain a robust pace, we still expect growth in manufacturing output to regain some momentum over the coming quarters.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Economics, said the CBI survey was disappointing, although the weakness was concentrated on export demand.</p> <p>\u201cThe outlook for manufacturers should remain decent on the domestic demand front, although they will be wary that any sustained political uncertainty around May\u2019s general election could hamper activity. Elevated consumer confidence, markedly improved consumer purchasing power and rising employment should underpin demand for consumer durable goods.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cOn the export front, UK manufacturers will be fervently hoping that the eurozone can build on recent signs of improving growth and this increasingly translates into increasing demand for UK manufactured goods.\u201d</p> <p>The problems in shifting the UK economy to export-led growth were further highlighted as the head of the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog was questioned by MPs about its forecast for the public finances. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">The Office for Budget Responsibility</a> made radical changes to its public finances outlook last week after the chancellor George Osborne used his pre-election budget to scrap plans that would have meant the biggest squeeze on public spending since the 1930s by the end of this decade.<br></p> <p>The chancellor plans deeper cuts in the nearer term, which, along with a windfall from the sales of some government assets, will allow him to increase spending in 2019-20.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/budget-2015\">Osborne made it clear in his final budget before the election</a> that his record on the deficit and credentials as a safe pair of hands to steer the economy forward would be a key battleground in the runup to the polls in May.</p> <p>The OBR predicts day-to-day public spending on public services will be \u00a328.5bn higher for 2019-20 than it had pencilled in at the time of the autumn statement in December. But it is warning this will mean a tighter squeeze on spending until 2018-19.</p> <p>The chancellor has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/19/budget-george-osborne-rejects-obr-forecast-of-much-sharper-squeeze-on-spending\">rejected the OBR\u2019s assessment that there will be a rollercoaster of deep cuts in the next Parliament</a>.</p> <p>Questioned by MPs, Robert Chote, the OBR chairman, defended the organisation\u2019s analysis: \u201cIf you carry out this exercise, it shows in 2017-18 and 2018-19 larger real cuts year on year.\u201d</p> <p>Chote said the OBR had improved transparency about public finances analysis since its creation five years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Afren, the struggling oil producer which dismissed top executives last year and is in the middle of a refinancing, has called in the Serious Fraud Office after another discovery relating to expenses payments. As part of a $200m funding agreement by certain bondholders, it has reported \u201cpreliminary concerns... regarding the hire of an individual within its operations in 2012 and the payment of certain travel and accommodation expenses connected to Afren\u2019s activities.\u201d Law firm Wilkie Farr &amp; Gallagher had been reviewing the company\u2019s procedures after whistle-blower reports, and Afren said: Having received WFG\u2019s preliminary findings of such review, the company has notified the proposed providers of the interim funding of such concerns. In addition to this disclosure the company has notified the Serious Fraud Office of such matters. The company has taken steps to halt its previous practices in relation to such expenses payments. The company has suffered a series of setbacks, including the failure of takeover talks with Nigeria\u2019s Seplat, disappointing results from a field in Kurdistan and a default on interest payments for a 2016 bond. Last year its chief executive and three other directors left after an independent review into unauthorised payments. Its shares have added 0.15p to 3.65p despite this latest news but Westhouse Securities issued a sell note: We once again re-iterate our view and rating and do not see any reason to currently own Afren\u2019s shares. This announcement indicates that Afren\u2019s questionable past activities are still re-surfacing and even if there are no more skeletons in the closet and the re-financing is successfully implemented, we do not see the debt burden diminishing and there are still uncertainties about future operations and ability to deliver attractive growth. SP Angel said: It is becoming a quite rote these days that Afren will release some new discovery about fraudulent claims, and that we will all be shocked then move on to wondering how big the dilution will be. Let\u2019s be clear. This latest fraud, probably wouldn\u2019t have been made public (nor should it have been) if the Company hadn\u2019t got the recent history that it has, that this is a case of the Company now being whiter than white. We believe it is now has to focus on the catastrophic failure of the CFO and his Fiannce team to adequately manage the Company\u2019s risk profile, such that it is in this position in the first place. While we would be the first to say that the directors haven\u2019t covered themselves in glory up to the point at which the discovery of the wrong doing was made, but since then, they have taken the often painful steps to put things right. The next stage to correcting the issues at Afren is to revamp the finance team with an emphasis on risk mitigation, and we believe (as we have said previously) that Simon Hawkins would be a good candidate for this. There is dilution ahead for the shareholders of Afren, the amount we believe is still in the hands of management. The Company has a solid asset base, and one which through judicious sale could yield cash to mitigate the dilution. Let\u2019s see what gives.",

And cruise company Carnival is down 63p at \u00a331.38 as Deutsche Bank moved from buy to hold: While we expect Carnival\u2019s first quarter update to demonstrate further bookings and pricing recovery coupled with more operational momentum in the core Carnival brand, we think recent significant moves in euro and pound foreign exchange could result in 2015 estimated earnings per share guidance being reduced around 8% and consensus coming back 5% to 10%. We remain positive on Carnival as we think the medium term earnings recovery potential remains intact, however with only 5% upside to our \u00a334 price target we move our recommendation to hold. Among the mid-caps Centamin has climbed 14% to 61.3p after the gold miner unveiled a better than expected dividend, while FirstGroup is up 4.3p at 99.35p as it secured the Great Western franchise - its largest - until April 2019.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of McDonald\u2019s in the UK, Jill McDonald, has been hired as the next chief executive of Halfords where she will become one of the few women at the helm of a London-listed company. McDonald, who is 50, will join the bike and car accessories chain on 11 May after five years heading the restaurant chain\u2019s UK operations. In January 2014 she took on responsibility for Germany, McDonald\u2019s biggest European market, and six other countries, overseeing 3,300 branches. Before joining the fast-food giant as UK chief marketing officer in 2006, McDonald spent 16 years in marketing for British Airways and also worked at Colgate Palmolive. She will replace Matt Davies, who is leaving Halfords to run Tesco\u2019s UK business, and be paid a salary worth \u00a3500,000, up to three times that amount as a bonus and a further \u00a31.5m maximum a year from a long-term share plan. Halfords will also award her \u00a3165,000 a year in company shares for the next three years to compensate her for forfeiting McDonald\u2019s shares when she leaves. There will be no financial performance targets attached to the payouts because there were none at McDonald\u2019s, according to Halford\u2019s chairman Dennis Millard. Shareholders are increasingly wary of \u201cgolden hellos\u201d that replace shares which new recruits leave behind at their previous company. Stretching payments over a number of years is seen as the minimum requirement because investors usually want a financial performance target as well. Millard said McDonald was hired because she would continue the work of Davies, who won credit for overhauling Halfords\u2019 customer service and building staff morale while improving financial performance. \u201cWe were looking for somebody who had experience and background in understanding what the consumer needs and somebody from a service industry really gets that. We also wanted someone with a track record in colleague engagement as well,\u201d Millard said. \u201cShe has been briefed very heavily on our existing strategy and she buys into that. We are about halfway through the journey from where Matt Davies joined to lead us to be a very high service business,\u201d he added. She helped lead the revamp of McDonald\u2019s image in the UK by toning down the appearance of stores and introducing healthier food options. McDonald\u2019s was not involved in the 2013 horsemeat scandal and the government\u2019s report into the affair praised the company\u2019s handling of burger supplies. Kate Calvert, an industry analyst at Investec, said: \u201cHer strong brand marketing and customer service background looks a good match for Halfords where the modernisation and turnaround strategy is well progressed. We expect her to bring her own take and emphasis.\u201d But veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb said the appointment of McDonald was \u201ca real \u2018left-field\u2019 choice\u201d for the company and that it was a step down from her role at the fast-food chain. McDonald, who has a first-class business studies degree from Brighton University, has spoken out against snobbery in business by urging companies to take on more school leavers instead of fixating on graduates. Her appointment will take the number of female chief executives at FTSE 250 companies to 10, according to the Professional Boards forum. Bosses at listed companies below the elite FTSE 100 include Dido Harding at Talk Talk, Katherine Garrett-Cox at Alliance Trust and Kate Swann at SSP. While her predecessor Matt Davies is a biking enthusiast known for cycling around the Lake District on a high-spec Boardman bike, McDonald owns a Halfords entry-level Apollo bike \u2013 although her husband is a cycling fan. \u201cShe lives in the country so there are lots of hills for her to cycle up and down,\u201d Millard said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We are now just seven weeks away from the budget and you would be hard-pressed to have a clue what cuts or spending the government will make. After over five years of painting debt as the most evil of economic bogeymen, Tony Abbott moved away from this narrative of austerity by suggesting last week that the budget would be \u201cdull\u201d but \u201cfrugal\u201d and that Australia\u2019s debt compared with other countries was a \u201cgood result\u201d. It suggests the government has awoken to the fact that economic growth is struggling to return to pre-global financial crisis (GFC) figures. However, rather than suggest fiscal stimulus and spending, and still trapped within the mantra of living within its means, the government seems unsure of what to do to improve growth and reduce unemployment. In the first episode of George Megalogenis\u2019 excellent program on the ABC, Making Australia Great: Inside Our Longest Boom former prime minister, Paul Keating, said about the GFC that \u201cAustralia sailed through ... without losing any skin.\u201d Such a view is perhaps a bit more common than it should be, because it vastly undersells the GFC\u2019s impact. Yes, Australia avoided a recession \u2013 but only if you class recessions as being two quarters of negative GDP growth in a row. We actually did lose some skin, but compared to other nations we needed a few band-aids on our knee rather than to put our whole leg in plaster. It\u2019s worth noting that the GFC hit these shores around August-September 2008 \u2013 six and a half years ago. And yet, if you have looked around lately you would have noticed that we are not exactly booming. For Australia, the GFC has been in two phases. When everyone thinks of the GFC, the first things they think of are banks crashing around the world, emergency meeting of central banks and the G20, interest rates slashed and a massive fiscal stimulus. But while Australia recovered much more strongly than other nations, from the middle of 2011 we entered the second phase of our GFC. The recovery stalled and unemployment began to rise. During the first phase, unemployment rose 1.6 percentage points, from 4.2% to 5.8% in nine months. But then the recovery kicked in, and by July 2011 it had fallen to 4.9%. Given that over the past 37 years we have only experienced an unemployment rate below 5% in 34 months, this was an amazing effort. But it didn\u2019t last. As much a victim of our own success, while the rest of the world was foundering we powered on and mining investment absolutely soared and so too did the value of our currency. The high value of our dollar hurt the non-mining sector as our exports became more expensive and, as a consequence, employment in these sectors began to slow. And since July 2011 \u2013 the month when our dollar reached a value of US$1.09 \u2013 the unemployment rate has risen 1.4 percentage points, from 4.9% to 6.3%: One of my favourite measures of the health of the employment sector is the employment to population ratio. And in an attempt to negate the effects of the ageing population and the greater tendency of younger people to stay in education, I like to focus on the prime working age of 25-54 years. Prior to the GFC hitting in 2008, we reached a record of around 80.3% of people aged 25-54 in Australia being employed. During the GFC first phase that fell 1.4% pts in 21 months, before it began improving from May 2010 until the middle of 2011. But as with the unemployment rate, from the middle of 2011 the ratio of prime-aged workers employed also began to falter. In July 2011, 79.9% of prime-aged workers were employed. By last month this had fallen 1 percentage point to 78.9%: Australia\u2019s employment situation for nearly four years has been a long period of torpor \u2013 an unprecedented long period. It has also been a period where we have seen interest rates fall to near unprecedented levels. And yet last week the governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, reaffirmed in a speech that relying on low interest rates to spur economic growth ain\u2019t going to cut it. It has also been a period where governments have done their best not to stimulate the economy. Deficits mostly occurred due to falling tax revenue rather than increased expenditure: Dealing with the first phase of the GFC was rather straightforward \u2013 pump growth enough to get through the dark period until things got back on stable settings. While the first part of the equation worked well, the second part hasn\u2019t. And in seven weeks Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott will be outlining their vision for the next four years. But that vision seems to be rather confused at the moment. Last year talk was all about a budget emergency, about the evil debt left over by the ALP spendthrifts. Last month, Joe Hockey\u2019s Intergenerational Report suggested rocky weather ahead over the next 40 years. It all seemed to be building up to another budget of \u201ctough choices\u201d and the continuation of Hockey\u2019s version of the ending of the age of entitlement. But then last week Abbott told 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell that the budget would be \u201cpretty dull and pretty routine\u201d. When asked by journalists if this meant he was resting on his laurels regarding structural reform, he replied that the budget would \u201ccertainly... be much less exciting than last year\u2019s budget because the task this year is at least 50% reduced from the task last year\u201d. That 50% measure was based on the absurd debt and deficit projections in the intergenerational report, which suggested that by 2054-55 Australia\u2019s debt to GDP would have reached 122% if the former ALP\u2019s policies had continued \u2013 but under the current budget projections it would be only 60%. Now, as dopey as those figures were, it still reinforced Abbott\u2019s mantra that debt is evil. Except the prime minister then appeared to say that the debt wasn\u2019t that bad after all, telling the media that \u201ca ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 or 60% is a pretty good result looking around the world\u201d. Suddenly the prime minister has discovered context. Rather than continually reference the debt situation to that under the Howard government, now he was comparing it to the rest of the world. He told the media that the budget would be \u201cprudent, frugal, responsible, there\u2019ll be something in it for families, a better childcare deal in particular, and there\u2019ll be much in it for small business.\u201d It is all rather confusing. The narrative of austerity has been replaced with \u201cprudent and frugal\u201d, which in budget parlance doesn\u2019t really suggest either big cuts or spending. It suggests a government struggling in the polls, led by a leader with little if any political capital to spend \u2013 certainly not enough to spend to pay the price of another austere budget. But there is also no sense that the government believes it needs to do anything to lift the economy out of its current docile state. Prior to the 2013 election, the government banked its economic performance on lifting confidence. And while there was initially some improvement, it hasn\u2019t lasted. Even though the NAB business conditions index remains in positive territory, it hasn\u2019t translated into jobs: The budget narrative is not the be all and end all, and often times in the months leading up to the second Tuesday in May there is an oversupply on spin about what it will entail. When a government less than two months out from the budget changes a major policy thrust, it does not suggest a government with its hand firmly on the tiller \u2013 rather one unsure of which way to go \u2013 whether for stimulus or austerity.",

By last month this had fallen 1 percentage point to 78.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Gjwo7/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Australia\u2019s employment situation for nearly four years has been a long period of torpor \u2013 an unprecedented long period. </p> <p>It has also been a period where we have seen interest rates fall to near unprecedented levels. And yet last week the governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-03-20.html\">reaffirmed</a> in a speech that relying on low interest rates to spur economic growth ain\u2019t going to cut it. </p> <p>It has also been a period where governments have done their best not to stimulate the economy. Deficits mostly occurred due to falling tax revenue rather than increased expenditure:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/rSVm1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dealing with the first phase of the GFC was rather straightforward \u2013 pump growth enough to get through the dark period until things got back on stable settings. </p> <p>While the first part of the equation worked well, the second part hasn\u2019t. </p> <p>And in seven weeks Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott will be outlining their vision for the next four years. But that vision seems to be rather confused at the moment. </p> <p>Last year talk was all about a budget emergency, about the evil debt left over by the ALP spendthrifts. Last month, Joe Hockey\u2019s Intergenerational Report suggested rocky weather ahead over the next 40 years. </p> <p>It all seemed to be building up to another budget of \u201ctough choices\u201d and the continuation of Hockey\u2019s version of the ending of the age of entitlement. </p> <p>But then last week Abbott told <a href=\"http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-03-18/interview-neil-mitchell-radio-3aw-melbourne\">3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell</a> that the budget would be \u201cpretty dull and pretty routine\u201d. </p> <p>When asked by <a href=\"http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-03-18/joint-press-conference-parliament-house\">journalists</a> if this meant he was resting on his laurels regarding structural reform, he replied that the budget would \u201ccertainly... be much less exciting than last year\u2019s budget because the task this year is at least 50% reduced from the task last year\u201d.</p> <p>That 50% measure was based on the absurd debt and deficit projections in the intergenerational report, which suggested that by 2054-55 Australia\u2019s debt to GDP would have reached 122% if the former ALP\u2019s policies had continued \u2013 but under the current budget projections it would be only 60%.</p> <p>Now, as dopey as those figures were, it still reinforced Abbott\u2019s mantra that debt is evil. Except the prime minister then appeared to say that the debt wasn\u2019t that bad after all, telling the media that \u201ca ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 or 60% is a pretty good result looking around the world\u201d.</p> <p>Suddenly the prime minister has discovered context. </p> <p>Rather than continually reference the debt situation to that under the Howard government, now he was comparing it to the rest of the world. </p> <p>He told the media that the budget would be \u201cprudent, frugal, responsible, there\u2019ll be something in it for families, a better childcare deal in particular, and there\u2019ll be much in it for small business.\u201d</p> <p>It is all rather confusing.</p> <p>The narrative of austerity has been replaced with \u201cprudent and frugal\u201d, which in budget parlance doesn\u2019t really suggest either big cuts or spending. It suggests a government struggling in the polls, led by a leader with little if any political capital to spend \u2013 certainly not enough to spend to pay the price of another austere budget. But there is also no sense that the government believes it needs to do anything to lift the economy out of its current docile state.</p> <p>Prior to the 2013 election, the government banked its economic performance on lifting confidence. And while there was initially some improvement, it hasn\u2019t lasted. Even though the NAB business conditions index remains in positive territory, it hasn\u2019t translated into jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/ZhxFK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The budget narrative is not the be all and end all, and often times in the months leading up to the second Tuesday in May there is an oversupply on spin about what it will entail. </p> <p>When a government less than two months out from the budget changes a major policy thrust, it does not suggest a government with its hand firmly on the tiller \u2013 rather one unsure of which way to go \u2013 whether for stimulus or austerity. </p>",
