      "bodyText": "New Palestine, Indiana, (population 2,000) is as far removed from the runways of London, Paris, Milan or New York as it is possible to imagine. But it was here, in a house so crowded she carved out a refuge for herself in the cupboard under the stairs, that Angela Ahrendts first set her sights on a career in fashion. Now as chief executive of Burberry, she's one of the most powerful figures in the big-ticket world of luxury labels \u2013 and one of Britain's best paid bosses: taking home \u00a317m in 2012 (more than any man working for a FTSE-100 blue-chip company that year) and another \u00a37m this year. \"It was always fashion,\" she says. \"If you read my high school yearbook, I was [someone] who at 16 knew exactly what I was going to do.\" What she has done, in the past seven years, is turn Burberry from a label that had become associated with baseball caps worn in nightclubs to the biggest British high-fashion brand, which ranks alongside anything the ateliers of Paris and Milan have to offer. She has signed up actors such as Eddie Redmayne and Emma Watson as the faces of the brand \u2013 and scored a huge publicity coup when she put Romeo Beckham in one of Burberry's trademark trench coats for a series of glossy magazine adverts. Ahrendts sells at eye-watering price points: Burberry sells \u00a314,000 alligator bowling bags, animal-print trench coats in calfskin for \u00a35,500 and \u00a395-a-pair babies' booties to buyers all over the world \u2013 but especially in Asia \u2013 and as a business it is now worth \u00a36.5bn \u2013 just a fraction less than Marks &amp; Spencer. Ahrendts went to Indiana's Ball State University aiming to make it as a designer, but soon realised she lacked the raw design talent of her fellow students. What she did have, though, was \"very strong opinions on everything they would do\". She recalls: \"A professor eventually sat me down and said: 'We call that [being] a merchant.'\" Her ambition was evident from the outset. The day after graduating she boarded a plane for New York to bang on doors on Manhattan's Seventh Avenue \u2013 leaving her primary school sweetheart Greg Ahrendts behind. It was the start of a 17-year distance relationship. She lived in a tiny midtown apartment and worked 80-hour weeks climbing the New York fashion career ladder, with stints at Donna Karan and Liz Claiborne, the company that owns Juicy Couture. Eventually she married Greg, who moved to New York and started a contracting business. Then, when she \"finally had my life under control\", her phone rang. It was Rose Marie Bravo, the then chief executive of Burberry, asking her to take on the mantle of the 156-year-old British label. \"No, no, no,\" Ahrendts replied. \"I finally had the country home, the three kids, the dog,\" she said in an interview with US chatshow host Charlie Rose. \"I didn't even meet her after the first call. I had the greatest job on Seventh Avenue. I honestly didn't think life could ever be any better. It was just peace and happiness.\" But Bravo kept calling, and she went to meet Christopher Bailey, Burberry's up-and-coming designer. \"We had lunch that day for three and a half hours and on the back of a napkin put our dreams on paper,\" she says. \"I loved him. I have such respect for him, he's a very special person.\" Bailey, whom Ahrendts had worked with at Donna Karen, says it's \"sort of weird how much Angela and I connect. I knew that [meeting] was going to be a big moment in my life, and it was,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in 2010. Ahrendts was still unsure of making the \"very, very big move\" across the Atlantic as someone who, in her son's words, is \"half a century old\". \"[Having to] sell your homes, unplug your kids from school. This had to be right.\" Burberry's history, from its founding by draper's apprentice Thomas Burberry to supplying trench coats to troops in the first world war and dressing Ernest Shackleton for the Antarctic, convinced her it was the right thing to do. But when she arrived for her first day in the job in London \u2013 after relocating Greg and her son Jennings, 17, and daughters Sommer, 16, and Angelina, 12, to a house 20 minutes west of the city \u2013 it became clear that the rest of Burberry's executive team had little love for the brand. \"They had flown in to classic British weather, grey and damp, but not one of these more than 60 people was wearing a Burberry trench coat. I doubt many of them owned one,\" she said in a Harvard Business Review article this year. \"If our top people weren't buying our products, despite the great discount they could get, how could we expect customers to pay full price for them?\" Justine Picardie, UK editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar, says Ahrendts spotted the problem early \u2013 Danniella Westbrook. The former EastEnders actress, who lost her septum through chronic cocaine use, had been splashed across the papers dressed head-to-toe in Burberry's check. Her baby daughter was also kitted out in Burberry, and Westbrook had a beige-check pram. The distinctive check, which dates back to the 1920s, had also become uniform of choice for yobs and football hooligans. \"Burberry had become so associated with a downmarket image,\" says Picardie. \"That iconic plaid had become\u2026 I'm not going to use the word chav, but that incredible legacy had become associated with the cheapest form of disposable rip-off fashion. Ahrendts and Christopher Bailey have taken it back to its pure heritage.\" Bringing the brand back from the brink was a hard, expensive slog involving buying back 23 licences Burberry had sold to allow other firms to put its check on everything, including disposable nappies for dogs. \"I feel like I spent my first few years here buying back the company \u2013 not the most pleasant or creative task,\" she says. \"But we had to do it. If you can't control everything, you can't control anything, not really.\" Creative control was given to Bailey, 41, whom she appointed \"brand tsar\" and then chief creative officer. \"Anything that the consumer sees \u2013 anywhere in the world \u2013 will go through his office.\" It won her few friends at the start. Within a year she had fired the whole of the company's Hong Kong design team and closed factories in New Jersey and the Rhondda Valley, south Wales, to centralise manufacturing in Castleford, West Yorkshire. Closing the Welsh factory caused a political firestorm and she was hauled before parliament to explain the decision. But her relentless focus on reviving Burberry's heritage to the \"millennial\" digital generation \u2013 which includes selling trench coats with mink collars, alligator epaulettes or studded leather sleeves \u2013 has worked wonders. Annual sales have more than doubled since 2007 to \u00a31.9bn, and the share price has doubled since she took over in 2006 to \u00a313.70. Ahrendts, who starts work checking her emails and social media before 5am most days, has benefited to the tune of \u00a323.7m in pay, bonuses and perks over the last two years. The perks of the job include a chauffeur-driven black Jaguar, help towards the cost of sending her children to an American school in London, and a \u00a325,000 annual clothing allowance \u2013on top of her 80% staff discount. The clothing allowance is the best money Burberry could spend, according to Picardie, who says Ahrendts, who stands more than 6ft in heels, is \"the best advert for Burberry Prorsum\", its haute couture range. \"She is always in Burberry Prorsum, and she wears it well,\" Picardie says. \"She shows how Prorsum can be worn by women other than Cara Delevingne and other glamorous young girls in its campaigns. She is wearing it as a consummate professional independent woman and is a very good advert for people that can actually afford to buy it. \"She is the opposite of the flashiness of Rich Ricci [the Barclays investment banker who topped the City pay league in 2011]. She is the antithesis of the hot air, flashy, empty, hollow men. She has substance.\" Picardie says those in the fashion industry believe Ahrendts \u2013 who is a relatively unknown figure to fashion editors but is close friends with Will.i.am \u2013 is worth every penny because she's \"not only revitalised Burberry, but helped make British fashion a massive success\" by bringing Burberry's premier fashion shows back to London. Sir Harold Tillman, chairman of the British Fashion Council, says he had made convincing Ahrendts to bring Burberry's shows back to London his \"key mission\". \"The very first time I went to meet her when she had just taken over I was so nervous it felt like my first job interview because it was so important to get her to bring the shows back,\" he says. \"She sat there and listened to everything I had to say, and six months later Burberry [womenswear] came back and put on the best possible show.\" Burberry has led the charge for other designers to show in London and ensures that the likes of Vogue editor Anna Wintour will now always come to London fashion week. On Tuesday Burberry will also bring its menswear show from Milan to London's Kensington Gardens for the first time in more than a decade. The day after Ahrendts's massive 2012 pay deal was reported by the Guardian last week a Burberry executive emailed all staff seeking to quell any resentment by explaining that most of the money was from previously awarded bonuses. \"There's no resentment. Everyone knows it's an insane amount, but everyone thinks she's totally worth the money,\" a Burberry executive said. \"Everyone loves her.\"",

      "body": "<p>Bob Robinson, the good-natured, broad-shouldered boss of Calgary construction firm Westcor, says: \"If you can't get a job in this city, you're not trying.\"</p> <p>Calgary is the Houston of Canada: a fast-growing city with a frontier atmosphere. The skyline is punctuated by glass and steel skyscrapers in which oil and gas executives plan multibillion-dollar investments against the distant backdrop of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains, while the eight-lane highways outside are clogged with oversized pick-up trucks.</p> <p>The oil and gas fields are many miles to the north, around Fort McMurray, but much of the money is made and spent here. The carefree boom times in the runup to 2007 were swept away by the financial crisis; but the continued thirst of emerging economies such as China for natural resources has helped to prop up world prices and new technology has opened up previously unreachable reserves in tar sands \u2013highly controversial among environmental campaigners.</p> <p>So while much of the rest of the world remains mired in economic slump, in Calgary business is looking up.</p> <p>\"We are seeing good, steady growth, and that's the way we like it,\" says Robinson. With the tough-minded independence that is the stereotypical characteristic of the western Canadian, he adds that he welcomed the slowdown, because too much of a \"sense of entitlement,\" had built up before 2007. While some of his rivals did go out of business, Westcor survived and today he's ramping up investment and fretting about skills shortages (the firm recently brought in a New Zealander under Canada's temporary worker programme).</p> <p>Ann-Marie Lurie, a local housing market economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board, says the picture in property is similar: \"We're not in a boom scenario,\" she says. Gone are the frenzied times before 2007 when investors were snapping up homes online without even seeing them. But prices have risen by 7% in the past year, and the cost of a detached family home here has just regained its pre-crisis peak of around $400,000 (\u00a3250,000).</p> <p>In the pleasant, leafy neighbourhoods of Bridgeland and Kensington, quaint clapboard bungalows are being torn down to be replaced by grander, two-storey suburban homes \u2013 with built-in garages so residents don't have to step outside to get into their cars when it's -30C in the winter.</p> <p>\"We did feel the recession, no doubt about it, but we came through it relatively unscathed,\" says Bruce Graham, director of Calgary Economic Development.</p> <p>It is economic resilience like this that has helped Canada to ride out the global storm of the past five years far more successfully than most of its rivals, and burnished the reputation of Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney \u2013 soon to take up his new job at the Bank of England in London \u2013 as a monetary policy whizz. Carney was brought up in Edmonton, 180 miles north of Calgary, and equally dependent on the oil industry.</p> <p>\"Among the G7, Canada is unique,\" Carney argued in his valedictory speech in Montreal, modestly titled \"Canada Works\". Carney went on: \"For us, the global financial crisis was an external rather than internal shock. When Canadian policymakers responded quickly and forcefully, our financial system channelled credit to where it was needed and our economy adjusted smartly.\"</p> <p>In Canada, economic output had recovered to its pre-crisis level by early 2011; in the UK, GDP remains almost 3% below its pre-recession peak.</p> <p>But even Carney's most ardent fans \u2013 and he has many in Canada \u2013 concede that he can't claim full credit for the country's strong performance. The benefit of natural resources, visible on every corner in Calgary, is perhaps the most important of three crucial factors that have helped to insulate the economy from the global storm.</p> <p>A tight hold on the purse strings was the second. While the UK entered the \"Great Recession\" running a deficit, Canada had had more than a decade of surpluses \u2013 the legacy of lessons learned during a deep fiscal crisis in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>At that time, the government was seen as being unable to get a grip on its spending and financial markets began to lose confidence in the Canadian dollar \u2013 comparing the country to Mexico, which had suffered a run on the peso, partly as a result of the perceived weakness of its financial management. US commentators had begun referring to Canada as a banana republic.</p> <p>The Liberal governments of the time, under prime minister John Chr\u00e9tien and his finance minister Paul Martin, introduced a series of tough budgets and dragged Canada back into the black, helped by rapid growth in the country's major export market, the US, and a gradual decline in interest rates across most of the major economies.</p> <p>Canada's third advantage was its conservative, relatively tightly regulated banking sector. When the boom was in full swing, politicians came under pressure to follow the global trend of deregulating the banks. But unlike New Labour in the UK, the Liberals refused to succumb to the allure of unleashing a swashbuckling finance sector. Instead, Canadian banks faced higher capital requirements than those included in the international Basel agreements and the government retained the power to vary criteria such as loan-to-value ratios on mortgages.</p> <p>After Stephen Harper's Conservative government took power in 2006, they did loosen lending requirements, allowing homebuyers to borrow over as much as 40 years with no deposit. But the rule change happened only in 2006, and the lending boom that followed was on nowhere near the scale of the sub-prime frenzy in the US.</p> <p>Ed Clark, chief executive of Canada's second-largest bank, TD, says as well as a different regulatory climate, there is an important difference of culture. \"The bank CEOs saw themselves as custodians of historical institutions,\" he says. \"I think of my job as one of passing on the institution to my successor in better shape than I got it.\"</p> <p>Asked why Canada's bank bosses never harboured Fred Goodwin-style aspirations to take on the world, Clark laughs: \"I think maybe because we never took ourselves that seriously: that's definitely a core Canadian characteristic. If you're sitting in London with a 150-year-old bank, you think you're the centre of the universe. We think of ourselves as a small country.\"</p> <p>Other observers say the relatively cosy nature of the Canadian banks, protected from the full blast of foreign competition by tight regulation, has also helped. John Crow, the British-born governor of the Bank of Canada from 1987 to 1994, says: \"Our banks have built up valuable domestic franchises. And the economics of franchises are such that they encourage you to be somewhat conservative in taking on risk. Whatever you think of that as regards competition, it adds a measure of stability to the financial system.\"</p> <p>During the credit crunch, the banks were supported by the Bank of Canada with extra liquidity \u2013 in effect, cut-price loans \u2013 but none was fragile enough to be taken over by the taxpayer.</p> <p>As Carney leaves for London, however, there is a niggling feeling among some in Canada that cracks are starting to appear in the country's outwardly successful economic model.</p> <p>A debate is raging about whether the country's reserves of black gold \u2013 and even its reputation as a \"safe haven\" amid the chaos of global markets \u2013 could become a curse, instead of a blessing.</p> <p>Since hitting a low of 62 cents against the US dollar in 2002, the Canadian dollar \u2013 the loonie, as it is known \u2013 has appreciated steadily. It hit parity with the dollar in 2007, and has hovered there ever since. There are growing fears that this may be evidence of a phenomenon economists call \"Dutch disease\" \u2013 where abundant natural resources drive up a country's exchange rate so far that other industries are crowded out.</p> <p>It's political anathema here, especially out west, to argue that oil and gas reserves are anything but a boon \u2013 or that the strength of the loonie is a problem.</p> <p>\"I look at it as, 'what are we producing best?'\" says Lurie with a shrug. \"To me, it's very clear that our economic advantage is in resources. If manufacturing's not doing well, maybe we shouldn't be doing it.\"</p> <p>Greg Stringham, of the Canadian Association of Petrol Producers, is keen to stress that reserves are widely spread across the country \u2013 with oil extraction taking place offshore in Quebec, to the east, and in British Columbia, to the west, as well as in Alberta. He points out that the complex technology required to extract oil from tar sands, or shale gas deposits from deep in the rocks, requires an array of parts \u2013 \"tanks, modules pumps \u2026 \" that are manufactured far and wide. \"That has really helped people to understand a bit more how important this was to the economy.\"</p> <p>\"Canadian industry has adjusted quite well to our currency,\" says Martin, the former finance minister. \"Of course, many people say it's because we're a commodity producer. I think the other reason for the strength of our currency is the strength of our balance sheet. We dealt with that in the mid-1990s and we're still reaping the benefits of that.\"</p> <p>Whatever the cause, there is little doubt that Canadian manufacturing was suffering, even before the downturn. \"The economy's become really unbalanced,\" says Bruce Campbell, of thinktank the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. (CCPA) \"We have seen this precipitous decline in manufacturing output in relation to the rest of the economy. What the lasting damage is, we don't know.\"</p> <p>Almost 300,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 2000 and 2011; although when Carney touched on the issue in a speech in Windsor, Ontario, in Canada's manufacturing heartland, he pointed out that a decline in industrial jobs has taken place across many industrialised economies over the past decade. \"Workers need to build skills and be prepared to shift jobs and even careers, if necessary,\" he warned. Unemployment in Ontario is 7.3%, against 4.8% in Alberta.</p> <p>The oil glut poses serious social questions, too. Like the financial services boom in the UK in the early noughties, Canada's resource extraction flatters the GDP figures, but despite what Bob Robinson of Westcor says, the benefits are not shared widely, even in the heart of oil country.</p> <p>Calgary is by far the country's most unequal city, and is becoming more so. It has its swish restaurants and casinos \u2013 but also food banks and homeless shelters. Recent research by the CCPA showed that the top 1% of Calgarians, as they are known, have seen on average a $570,000 increase in pay since 1982, adjusted for inflation; while the bottom 90% saw an increase of just $2,000.</p> <p>In a characteristically loose interpretation of his remit, Carney recently highlighted widening income inequality, underlining the fact that the share of income taken home by the top 1% of earners in Canada was the third-highest in the OECD \u2013 after the US and UK. His wife, Diana, who works for a centrist thinktank, Canada 2020, recently gave testimony on the issue in the Canadian parliament. \"One of the things about Carney which I think bodes well is that he has displayed a sensitivity to this issue,\" says Campbell.</p> <p>Perhaps the clearest sign of potential stress in the Canadian economy, and another issue repeatedly highlighted by Carney, however, is sky-high household debt: a side effect of what the International Monetary Fund has called an \"exuberant\" housing market.</p> <p>It is hard to walk down a street in Toronto without seeing vast signs advertising the scores of new \"condo\" developments in the city; while in Vancouver, the cosmopolitan melting pot in Canada's far west and its frothiest housing market, headlines last week highlighted the fact that a penthouse in a swanky new development had changed hands for a record $25m \u2014 a classic bubble tale.</p> <p>In its most recent report on the Canadian economy, the IMF suggested that average homes are on average 10% to 15% overvalued. As house prices have risen and interest rates have been slashed to help the economy through the slump, many homeowners have responded by borrowing more. Household debt now stands at 162% of GDP, which is similar to levels in the US and UK before the downturn.</p> <p>The finance ministry, with advice from Carney, has taken steps to slow the pace of credit growth; crucially, by tightening mortgage lending requirements. Growth rates of borrowing have come down but, at best, the heavy burden of debt is likely to be a drag on consumer spending for some time to come. At worst, it could leave Canadian households exposed if there is a sharp rise in interest rates, or a jump in unemployment.</p> <p>\"It's a gauge of vulnerability,\" says Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. \"It's not just a housing bubble potentially, but it's a personal debt bubble, which is quite closely related.\"</p> <p>He believes high debt levels and the effervescent housing market are a bigger threat to Canada than the international environment. \"The big risks in the past were external, which we don't really have any control over. It seems now that the domestic risks are more disconcerting.\" Clark, of TD Bank, agrees: \"I have been arguing for some time that the tailwinds that made us outperform the world for a certain period of time have gradually dissipated, and the headwinds have increased.\"</p> <p>In Calgary, the phlegmatic locals say they're always prepared for the worst. \"Calgary rides with what happens in energy,\" says Lurie. \"We do tend to go through booms and busts in Calgary, more so than in other areas.\" Meanwhile, Westcor's finance director David Vandegriff recalls a favourite Albertan bumper sticker during the deep recession of the 1980s: \"Please Lord, let there be another oil boom and we promise not to piss it away this time.\"</p>",

The announcement by RBS at 5.15pm on Wednesday about the departure of the 52-year-old Yorkshireman from arguably the highest-profile role in banking stunned the City. It sparked a wave of political recriminations about the hand of the government in forcing him out to clear the way for privatisation of the 81% taxpayer-owned bank before the general election in 2015. Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, whose own tenure at the bailed-out bank is also being called into question, admits that Hester would still be in the top job if the plans for privatisation were not on the table. \"If the privatisation wasn't there, we'd be rolling on, probably looking for Stephen to have a successor (later) in 2014,\" Hampton told the Observer. Hampton, who insists that he has \"no imminent plans\" to quit until Hester's replacement has \"their feet under the table\" said Hester's departure had been accelerated at the request of UK Financial Investments, the body that looks after the stakes in the bailed-out banks.By the time of the bank's annual meeting in 2015, Hampton will have served six years, so this is seen by some as a moment to bow out. Hester, who was admired by Osborne when the chancellor was in opposition, had not won as many friends in the coalition as he might. Aside from the rows over his bonus payments, he did not shrink the investment bank as far or as fast as the new coalition government wanted. Neither, in the eyes of coalition politicians, did he make lending to small business a high enough priority. Hester might argue that the goalposts were moving constantly while he was trying to stop the bank going bust \u2013 a rescue job that turned out to be far harder than he had thought it was going to be. During the meeting with Robin Budenberg, the chairman of UKFI, Hampton was told that the body had been \"sharpening\" its views on the future of RBS and wanted it to be ready for possible privatisation by the end of 2014. A chief executive was needed who would see through the sell-off and then stay on for another five years or so. \"That would mean that Stephen would potentially do nine or 10 years, which is an incredibly long time,\" says Hampton. And a prospectus for a share sale requires a chief executive to be \"enduring\", he adds. From the moment his departure was announced, Hester made it clear that it was not his idea to quit. It was \"a board decision,\" he told reporters on a hastily convened conference call 30 minutes after the announcement. \"I'm cooperating amicably,\" he said. Hester had known since the end of May that he was heading for the exit. He and Hampton had discussed on many occasions which one of them would leave first \u2013 they had arrived within months of each other after 2008 bailout and chief executives and chairman rarely bow out the same time. They had never resolved which one would go first, but with privatisation on the agenda next year, succession planning \u2013 usually discussed in June \u2013 was becoming more crucial. Hester, whom the board had assumed would step down after completing his five-year restructuring plan next year, had begun to test publicly the appetite for him to stay on. Accustomed to being asked how long he intended to stay \u2013 particularly after he admitted having nearly walked out in anger in January 2012 during the row over his bonus \u2013 at the start of May he was still handing out his stock answer. \"I took on a mission with this bank; that mission is shared with colleagues and we want to return this bank to doing the job for the whole nation that it can do, in cleaned-up form, supporting customers and with a profitable and successful future.\" But just a few days later, his language about staying on to see through a sell-off had hardened: \"If I'm wanted [to lead the privatisation], why wouldn't I want to do that?\" he said. By mid-May, speaking outside the bank's annual general meeting in Edinburgh, he was even firmer: \"If people think I can contribute, I'd like to see this company and this mission through to privatisation.\" Others, however, had other ideas. A fortnight ago, Hampton called a private meeting with George Osborne. The RBS chairman makes it clear that there was no disagreement between the bank and the government \u2013 in other words, he also thought it was time for Hester to go. The bank's board and the government had always been keen to get the bank out of state ownership as soon as possible. At the same time, some board members are said to have been forming the view that Hester, an accomplished investment banker who had been parachuted in to run RBS when it was on the brink of collapse, might find running a \"normal\" bank rather less exhilarating than the huge rescue job of the past five years. Hampton felt that finding a replacement for Hester could not be done in secret \u2013 or behind the back of the chief executive. With the search for Hester's successor by headhunter Anna Mann under way, the City is awaiting details from the chancellor about how he intends to steer the sell-off and is concerned about whether an appointment can be made by the end of the year. Some shareholders are anxious that Hester was forced out by Osborne and that there is too much political interference in the bank. Hence the \u00a31bn wiped off RBS's stock market value on Thursday. \"The message is that no matter what is said we are at the whim of the largest shareholder and that clearly implies a significant discount,\" one said. But mixed messages are coming out of the government. Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron appeared to be clearing the way for a big public sell-off of RBS; last week, however, he appeared to be softening expectations, talking about the public being more concerned about a bank that can contribute to the recovery of the economy. Treasury minister Sajid Javid told MPs that there was no timetable, no sell-off price and the 2015 general election was not regarded as a key date. Meanwhile, Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, waded into the debate about the shape of RBS, saying it could not be \"huge, big, hulking, what they call universal bank\". The parliamentary commission on banking standards, expected to report this week, could also call for a debate about splitting RBS into a good and bad bank. This could delay any attempt at privatisation, the Policy Exchange thinktank warned last week. Ulster Bank is the major problem that has yet to be fixed and an obvious candidate for bad bank treatment. Hampton concedes that the debate about the structure of RBS is still raging because the bank has stayed in government ownership longer than the three or so years that had been expected, partly because of the eurozone crisis. \"Because things have taken longer, these things get more debated in political circles,\" said Hampton. That debate is likely to become even more heated this week when Osborne sets out his plans for banking reform in Wednesday's Mansion House speech. No doubt Hester will be listening closely to ensure his resignation was not in vain.",

      "bodyText": "Last year, as George Osborne arrived to deliver his Mansion House speech, he was greeted by a BBC comedy presenter, who handed him a GCSE maths text book. The chancellor might have justifiably retorted with a study guide on delivering gags \u2013 but, to be fair to the novice comic, the bar for funnies at this event had already been set unattainably high. No one has ever bettered Gordon Brown's 2007 classic line: \"I congratulate you Lord Mayor and the City of London on these remarkable achievements, an era that history will record as the beginning of a new golden age for the City of London.\" Nor, frankly, should we try. While we can all benefit from studying Brown's comic timing, few can better the current chancellor's feel for political theatre. The departure of Stephen Hester from the Royal Bank of Scotland last week \u2013 supposedly at Osborne's urging \u2013 has set up this week's Mansion House address just splendidly. Ostensibly, the speech is always about the chancellor's take on the state of the British economy, but this year it will be as closely watched for his views on British banking, as he is thought to want to begin returning taxpayer stakes in RBS (and Lloyds) to the private sector before the election. Now that Hester has gone, some City wags muse, that is one of the biggest jokes of all. Red faces over Project Verde? There may be a limited market in UK high street banking but, when it comes to banking inquiries, supply might even be outstripping demand. This week sees the start of another probe by MPs when Lloyds Banking Group's striking chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and its ever so slightly less comely chairman, Sir Winfried Bischoff, appear in front of the Treasury select committee to explain the farce of Project Verde. You'll recall that little embarrassment involves Lloyds's efforts to offload the 632 branches it's been forced to flog by European competition authorities as the price of its state bailout, but the whole process is taking longer than a PPI claim to the bank's call centre. The Co-operative Bank had been the frontrunner to buy the rump of the black horse but the deal \u2013 which would have increased its share of the current account market from 2% to 7% \u2013 fell over in March after weeks of speculation about the Co-op's financial position and just before its debt was downgraded to junk and its chief executive quit. The committee wants to know how the deal got so far \u2013 not that it has a monopoly on that question. Igor and Bob best buddies again As the then boss of TNK-BP, he was chased out of Russia in 2008 amid speculation that the Kremlin was supporting a campaign of harassment. He returned in 2011 to sign \"a groundbreaking strategic global alliance\" between BP and Russia's leading oil company, Rosneft, only to get comprehensively bullied out of that one by his old TNK nemeses. So when BP boss Bob Dudley touches down in St Petersburg this week, you'd be forgiven for wondering if he'll have bothered packing his toothbrush. Dudley will be in the old city of revolution to attend Rosneft's annual meeting, as BP now holds a 20% stake in the firm. He is due to be voted on to the Russian group's board, which means he'll be serving as a director alongside one Igor Sechin, Russia's former deputy PM. That would be the same Sechin that WikiLeaks cables suggest Dudley blamed for the campaign that forced him to go on the run for his own protection in 2008. And the same man whom the Russian press calls \"Darth Vader\" \u2013 when they're not dubbing him \"the scariest person on Earth\". \"We are all friends now,\" insists a BP insider, who says Sechin has even visited its St James's base. Can this spirit of glasnost last? \"In Russia allegiances change,\" BP's man mutters.",

      "standfirst": "Whether the UK can get shale gas flowing as fast as the US has remains in doubt, but Centrica seems ready to give it a try", 
      "body": "<p>Expect to see more big names from the oil industry, such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil, moving into the British shale sector now that one of their competitors \u2013 Centrica \u2013 has taken the plunge. The international companies have always taken a keen interest in the UK fracking scene, despite endless statements from their chief executives that there are better prospects in China and elsewhere.</p> <p>There is some speculation this weekend that the reason Centrica paid a fairly toppy price for the stake in the Bowland Shale licence from Cuadrilla Resources was because it faced competition from Shell and others.</p> <p>It is not so much the geological uncertainty that made big oil hesitate in the past, but the fear of reputational damage. And as one of the industry players told the <em>Observer</em>: \"That all changes now because Centrica has elected to become the lightning rod for the industry.\"</p> <p>Indeed it will. Green groups opposed to fracking because of the chemicals used and because they believe more gas use means more carbon emissions have already condemned Centrica. A couple of small earthquakes in the Blackpool region that helped to trigger an 18-month drilling moratorium have heightened public concerns. Fracking remains banned in France, Bulgaria and some other countries.</p> <p>In fact it was always likely that the British Gas parent group would be first out of the blocks, not least because it has the largest retail supply business in this country.</p> <p>Equally, if anyone is going to have the inside track on what government is thinking about the future taxation structure planned for a shale gas regime, it is going to be homegrown Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, rather than say Peter Voser, the boss of Shell, who spends much more time in The Hague than London.</p> <p>Laidlaw is constantly in and out of Whitehall. Until recently he was part of David Cameron's Business Advisory Group, while Centrica, as one of the UK's few, and by far the biggest, British-owned power suppliers, stands most to gain from changes in UK energy policy.</p> <p>Was British Gas pushed by ministers to front UK shale? Certainly Centrica had privately expressed reservations about the flack it might take if it got involved at an early stage. Ministers were keen to give credibility to a sector populated by small firms, even if some have big backers behind the scenes, such as IGas's connections with the partly state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation.</p> <p>But it seems more likely that Laidlaw, who as recently as January had expressed the view that UK shale was no \"game changer\", just changed his mind and decided it was worth having first-mover advantage.</p> <p>He had no doubt spent much time talking to John Browne, whose chief executiveship at BP was characterised by being first off the blocks (into Russia, mega-mergers with Amoco etc) and just happens to be a director of Cuadrilla and the UK government's lead non-executive board member.</p> <p>So Centrica is to spend \u00a3100m helping Cuadrilla with an exploration programme which restarts in earnest next year with a new, fourth, well. A further \u00a360m is promised if the exploration turns into production.</p> <p>But the size and scale of the shale sector in Britain remains unclear.

      "bodyText": "Expect to see more big names from the oil industry, such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil, moving into the British shale sector now that one of their competitors \u2013 Centrica \u2013 has taken the plunge. The international companies have always taken a keen interest in the UK fracking scene, despite endless statements from their chief executives that there are better prospects in China and elsewhere. There is some speculation this weekend that the reason Centrica paid a fairly toppy price for the stake in the Bowland Shale licence from Cuadrilla Resources was because it faced competition from Shell and others. It is not so much the geological uncertainty that made big oil hesitate in the past, but the fear of reputational damage. And as one of the industry players told the Observer: \"That all changes now because Centrica has elected to become the lightning rod for the industry.\" Indeed it will. Green groups opposed to fracking because of the chemicals used and because they believe more gas use means more carbon emissions have already condemned Centrica. A couple of small earthquakes in the Blackpool region that helped to trigger an 18-month drilling moratorium have heightened public concerns. Fracking remains banned in France, Bulgaria and some other countries. In fact it was always likely that the British Gas parent group would be first out of the blocks, not least because it has the largest retail supply business in this country. Equally, if anyone is going to have the inside track on what government is thinking about the future taxation structure planned for a shale gas regime, it is going to be homegrown Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, rather than say Peter Voser, the boss of Shell, who spends much more time in The Hague than London. Laidlaw is constantly in and out of Whitehall. Until recently he was part of David Cameron's Business Advisory Group, while Centrica, as one of the UK's few, and by far the biggest, British-owned power suppliers, stands most to gain from changes in UK energy policy. Was British Gas pushed by ministers to front UK shale? Certainly Centrica had privately expressed reservations about the flack it might take if it got involved at an early stage. Ministers were keen to give credibility to a sector populated by small firms, even if some have big backers behind the scenes, such as IGas's connections with the partly state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation. But it seems more likely that Laidlaw, who as recently as January had expressed the view that UK shale was no \"game changer\", just changed his mind and decided it was worth having first-mover advantage. He had no doubt spent much time talking to John Browne, whose chief executiveship at BP was characterised by being first off the blocks (into Russia, mega-mergers with Amoco etc) and just happens to be a director of Cuadrilla and the UK government's lead non-executive board member. So Centrica is to spend \u00a3100m helping Cuadrilla with an exploration programme which restarts in earnest next year with a new, fourth, well. A further \u00a360m is promised if the exploration turns into production. But the size and scale of the shale sector in Britain remains unclear. The British Geological Survey is shortly expected to come up with some encouraging new reserve estimates. Equally, the Treasury will confirm the level of tax breaks available before the parliamentary recess next month. But the issue that will decide whether Britain can replicate the enormous success of the shale frackers in America, where prices have dropped like a stone, is whether the gas can be made to flow from the rocks easily and in large quantities. That will only be known once more wells are drilled, but Centrica is clearly optimistic. Deflation could be the way forward Hard though it is to believe, historically Britain has been as prone to bouts of deflation as it has to inflation. Not in the past half-century, of course, but in the three centuries or so since the Bank of England was founded in 1694, there have been as many years when prices have fallen as there have when they have risen. Indeed, until quite recently deflation was the natural order of things. Competition resulted in downward pressure on prices and it was only during wars that inflation moved upwards.

Because debt levels are already uncomfortably high; the collateral against which the debt is secured is impaired; and there has been a widespread backlash against debt that was sparked off by the financial crisis. As a result, the only way the age of inflation could be extended into the future is if central banks decide that it is a lesser evil than deflation. In the short term, that is certainly the case, which explains why central banks have been pumping credit into their economies through quantitative easing. But will central banks really be comfortable with the next stage on from QE, helicopter drops of money into economies? Joshi says that ultimately policymakers will prefer modest falls in the price level to the risk of runaway inflation, and that deflation will become the new normal. Cosy chair awaits Tucker Paul Tucker's decision to quit his job at the Bank of England was not unexpected.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Has the Labour party thrown in the towel? Are rightwing commentators correct in claiming that recent speeches by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls amount to surrender? Given the strength of Balls's compelling case against the coalition's austerity programme \u2013 from that prescient Bloomberg lecture in August 2010 onwards \u2013 the news that Labour intends to stick to the coalition's spending plans for 2015-16, essentially acquiescing in a policy it had successfully ridiculed, is disturbing, to put it mildly. That celebrated Bloomberg lecture drew reluctant admiration from no less a Conservative figure than Alexander \"Boris\" Johnson, who noted that George Osborne's warnings of a Greek-style sovereign debt crisis and cripplingly high interest rates proved wide of the mark. At the time Johnson, taking Balls seriously, expressed fears of a double-dip recession and called for the government to go easy on its austerity programme. We now seem to be witnessing a collective failure of nerve. At just the moment when even the International Monetary Fund is owning up to having got it wrong, Labour, fearful of entering the next election campaign being pilloried as the spending party, gives the impression of being trapped in the headlights. And just for good measure, those highly respected independent thinktanks, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute for Government, have lamely accepted that it is going to be a case of \"austerity, austerity, austerity\" for the remainder of the decade. One commentator has compared the situation to 1976, when the chancellor, Denis Healey, turned back at Heathrow rather than fly to an IMF meeting in Manila. The IMF people who mattered were closer to home, and there was an almighty crisis. Conservative commentators never tire of quoting the speech by prime minister Jim Callaghan to the Labour conference in the midst of that crisis, when he said that the days of spending one's way out of recession were gone. But, as Callaghan made clear in his memoirs, that speech was entirely tactical. The fact of the matter is that the only way an economy can emerge from depression is by spending its way out. And if the banking system has, to all intents and purposes, gone absent without leave, and the private sector is in the doldrums, then the public sector has to step in. Month by month, analysts grasp at straws whenever there is an economic indicator suggesting that there could possibly be the beginnings of an upturn. But in the early stages of a traditional economic recovery one should be looking for a sustained growth rate of two, three or four percent, until the huge amount of slack in the economy \u2013 idle plant, unused machinery, unemployed people desperate for work \u2013 is absorbed. Yet that most reputable of think-tanks, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which recently celebrated its 75th birthday, observes in its May review: \"The absence of a sustained period of robust growth has plagued the UK economy since the end of the 'Great Recession' in the second quarter of 2009.\" That was the time when, with world trade collapsing at a rate of 20% per annum, G20 policymakers, with Gordon Brown at the helm, steered the world economy back on course, with the aid of a $1 trillion collective stimulus. Brown wanted to maintain the stimulus: the US government did, but the 2010 coalition did not, in the name of budgetary consolidation. The US budget position improved dramatically with economic growth while the British deficit, in the absence of decent growth, continues to be an embarrassment. As Niesr notes about this country: \"Economic performance is perhaps better described as 'stagnant'.\" The coalition is presiding over the worst recovery ever. In his 2010 speech, Balls rightly said the deficit and level of national debt must be tackled eventually, \"but only once growth is fully secured and over a markedly longer period than George Osborne is currently planning\". Growth at this stage is manifestly not fully secured. The coalition is planning drastic cuts for 2015-16 without having the faintest idea whether the economy will have emerged from depression. For Labour to commit itself to acceptance of those cuts at this stage is economically unwise. Some political correspondents may salute the Opposition for heading off Conservative criticism, and listening to ill-informed focus groups, but this is all spin. As Balls said himself in 2010 of the banking crisis, the country \"has been through a once-in-a-generation event like the second world war \u2026 it was possible for our postwar government to have the wisdom and foresight to recognise the benefits of a slower, steadier approach to reducing an even bigger debt.\" The temptation for an electorate that has heard Labour attack austerity for three years, and now learns about what appears to be a major U-turn, is to ask: so what is the difference between the parties? Well, there is a difference. It was reported a few weeks ago that Labour had abandoned its plan to cut VAT. What Ed Balls actually said in his speech on 3 June was: \"Today, with growth prospects still very uncertain \u2026 a temporary VAT cut now is still the right prescription \u2026 \" Unfortunately, Labour is not in a position to make a temporary VAT cut. Without a major boost to demand, the situation in 2015-16 could still be one of a barely perceptible recovery from depression \u2013 which makes the adoption of plans for further spending cuts look all the more eccentric.",
