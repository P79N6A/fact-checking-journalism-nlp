      "bodyText": "As festivalgoers get home from enjoying The Who, Adam Ant and Queen on the Isle of Wight over the weekend, a warning has gone out that other events are surviving on such precarious finances that as many as one in 10 could close down by next year. The rising price of security and the huge demands on infrastructure could mean as many as 100 of this year\u2019s festivals will not reappear in 2017, according to research by delivery group ParcelHero. The warning comes as UK Music, the umbrella organisation for the industry, highlighted the huge contribution of live bands and music tourism to the economy. Live music events attracted more than 27m people last year, the group said \u2013 3.7m of those at festivals and the remainder at standalone concerts. It said 760,000 of the audience were overseas visitors spending an average of \u00a3852 a visit. The industry accounts for more than 39,000 full-time jobs, according to the research by Oxford Economics for Music UK. There is no doubt that festivals have become big business \u2013 an estimated 1,000 festivals (from music, to literary, to beer and food) will take place through 2016, six times as many as 12 years ago, ParcelHero said. But despite visitors paying an average of \u00a3200 for a ticket, and big events attracting thousands of revellers, the amount of money they make can be tiny in comparison with the overall budget, said David Jinks, ParcelHero\u2019s head of consumer research. Pretax profits at Glastonbury, for instance, fell from \u00a3764,000 in 2013 to \u00a386,000 in 2014, he said. \u201cIt just needs something like a wet summer and it could put some of the larger ones over the edge,\u201d he added. At particular risk, Jinks said, are some of the large numbers of recently launched festivals run by eager fans. Some of the smaller festivals at risk are run by enthusiasts [in which] everyone clubs together to pay for the event, he said. \u201cIt is music fans as opposed to business people. Some of those, if there is a poor summer, and if there are policing costs, they would definitely be endangered.\u201d A festival can run on a financial knife-edge, with one quarter of ticket prices typically taken up by VAT and royalty fees to songwriters. The logistical costs are big too: water, electricity, waste management, while security must police the event. Then comes the costs of the actual live acts. \u201cThe infrastructure costs of getting some of these big stages set up are incredible,\u201d said Jinks. The cost of powering a 10,000-capacity festival can be \u00a3100,000, according to the report. Policing the Isle of Wight festival has been put at \u00a31m. \u201cIt is when they start to expand that is when their bubbles burst, \u2013 the costs don\u2019t add up,\u201d said Jinks. This weekend, as well as the Isle of Wight, saw festivalgoers flock to Parklife in Manchester, Field Day in Victoria Park, London, Download at Donington Park in Leicestershire and Wildlife in Brighton. But there have been high-profile cancellations already this year. Last month, the Temples heavy metal festival in Bristol was cancelled four days before it was due to take place. Promoter Francis Mace said the financial backers had pulled their funding. \u201cI am deeply deeply sorry to all of those who will lose out as a result of this decision, having put three years of my life and having already lost so much of it to the festival I\u2019m afraid there is no option to continue with Temples Festival 2016 and I take full responsibility for events cancellation. I am truly sorry,\u201d he said in a Facebook post to ticketholders. Forgotten Fields, due to take place in Tunbridge Wells, was also cancelled, with the organisers blaming rising costs. \u201cDue to the rising costs of producing a quality event of this size, we are unable to produce a show that is of the standard both our team and customers would be proud of,\u201d a statement said. Music festivals and concerts have been the fastest growing area of leisure spending over the five years to 2015, according to market researchers Mintel. It estimated 40% of Britons went to at least one event, spending a collective \u00a32.1bn. Analyst Michael Oliver said he expected revenues to continue growing in the future, with ticket sales typically rising faster than average inflation, although the actual number of people attending could level off as more festivals fell by the wayside. \u201cIt is certainly not unknown for people trying to break into the market or even established operators to get into difficulty because it is so dependent on the quality of the acts you get,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you could have a fantastic event one year but if you can\u2019t get a really good line up for the following year you are going to be in trouble. \u201cWhether the number of people going to festivals continues to grow, I think you are going to see a plateauing in the number in the next two or three years \u2026 there are an awful lot of festivals and I think there is only really room for a set number of events.\u201d Festival facts in figures 50p The profit made a ticket sold at Glastonbury in 2014, with turnover at \u00a337m and total profits at \u00a386,000. 57 The number of festivals cancelled over the wet summer of 2012.

    "webTitle": "MPs draw up penalties for Philip Green if he fails to attend inquiry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs are preparing to invoke a list of sanctions against Sir Philip Green should the billionaire retailer fail to appear before this week\u2019s parliamentary select committee examining the collapse of BHS. The move, which could include the Topshop tycoon being found in contempt of parliament or facing a Commons vote on whether he is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be running a business, comes after Green said on Friday that he was not prepared to participate in the inquiry. The list of punishments, which are separate from the numerous calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood in the wake of the collapse of BHS, are derived from the template prepared by the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which has just faced down a similar challenge to its authority from the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley. When asked if the same list of options was now open to both the BIS and the work and pensions committees in their joint investigation of BHS, one member said: \u201cOh yeah\u201d. Green claimed on Friday that the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of the department store chain was biased and suggested he would not give evidence to MPs on Wednesday unless Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, stepped down. Green wrote to Field: \u201cI am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation. I therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry.\u201d Field had previously told the Financial Times that he \u201cwould laugh\u201d if Green offered less than \u00a3600m to settle BHS\u2019s pension debts. Over the weekend he told the BBC it was for the House of Commons to decide \u201cwho chairs these committees, not Sir Philip Green\u201d. BHS slumped into administration just a year after Green sold it for \u00a31 to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, who had previously been declared bankrupt and whose claims of previous business successes quickly evaporated. The collapse puts about 11,000 jobs at risk and leaves the company\u2019s pension scheme with a \u00a3571m deficit. The sudden failure of the business, as well as questions over Chappell\u2019s credentials, have led to calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, added to those calls in an article written for the Observer, in which he wrote: \u201cThe fact [Green] feels he can threaten to subvert parliament is an insult to the British public. If he refuses to come before parliament, Green should be stripped of his knighthood.\u201d On Sunday, Tim Farron became the first head of a major political party to press for the honour to be rescinded. The Liberal Democrat leader said: \u201cPhilip Green should be stripped of his knighthood. There should be no debate about it. Every day he keeps his gong it shames the honours system and dishonours the thousands of staff now having to look for work.\u201d Sir John Collins, a former chairman of Dixons who headed the Whitehall honours committee that proposed Green\u2019s ennoblement, has also said the tycoon should be stripped of the honour if his handling of BHS is found to have lacked integrity. Green\u2019s threat not to attend is the second time this year that a billionaire retailer has challenged the authority of a select committee. Ashley spent months refusing to attend a BIS select committee convened to examine allegations of draconian working conditions at the sports retailer. He continued to refuse despite receiving a formal parliamentary summons, but finally appeared last week after the committee hinted it would start the process of finding him in contempt of parliament. The appearance produced a confession from the billionaire that his company had failed to pay staff the national minimum wage, confirming the findings of a Guardian investigation last year in which undercover reporters exposed how compulsory searches in unpaid time meant the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum. Ashley also admitted that Sports Direct is under investigation from HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which polices the minimum wage. A spokesman for Green said he was still deciding whether he would appear before the committee this week. Ashley meantime has written to the administrators of BHS expressing an interest in taking over a number of stores. In his letter, reported by the BBC, he said he was keen to save the BHS brand and jobs, which is being wound down after administrators failed to find a buyer for the collapsed business. The move comes after Ashley is understood to have tabled a \u201clow-ball offer\u201d for the department store when it was in administration. The administrator, Duff &amp; Phelps, will reportedly respond on Monday by urging Ashley to make a formal bid for stores and the brand name. When Ashley was hauled in front of the BIS committee last week, he was asked if he had wanted to acquire BHS. He said he had \u201c100%\u201d wanted to buy the chain. The prospect of Ashley offering to save jobs will be seen by some as a mixed blessing, and the latest in a string of protests against the working practices at Sports Direct will be held on Monday. The Unite union is organising a march through Chesterfield, including an activist dressed up as Dick Turpin in response to claims that workers are being robbed of their wages. Unite\u2019s regional officer Luke Primarolo said workers employed through employment agencies were subject to \u201cdaylight robbery\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A one-off tax on Britain\u2019s super-rich is the only feasible way to tackle the government\u2019s spending deficit and protect vital public services, according to a report backed by the Labour MP Dan Jarvis and the left-of-centre Fabian Society thinktank. The levy would apply to UK residents with more than \u00a310m in assets, with a supplementary charge for those with more than \u00a320m in shares and property. The Fabian Society said the British tax authority, HMRC, could target the richest holders of \u201cpassive, unearned wealth\u201d to bring in extra cash, but that the rate at which the tax was charged should be left to the government of the day. Difficulties in estimating the extent of assets the super-rich hold also prevent supporters of a wealth tax judging how much a levy would raise, it said, following HMRC\u2019s failure to publish data on the wealth of Britain\u2019s top 1%. The report argued a levy would galvanise the tax authorities to crack down on those concealing their assets offshore or through complex ownership structures. Earlier this year the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has put forward proposals of its own for an annual wealth tax, said the chancellor, George Osborne, would need to raise more in taxes or cut expenditure further to meet his fiscal promise of generating a budget surplus by the end of the parliament. Jarvis said any sums raised by a one-off levy would make a significant impact on the government\u2019s finances. \u201cIn a country where the top 1,000 have combined wealth of \u00a3576bn, the revenue makes a sizeable dent in the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threshold is so high that only those who are truly wealthy pay the levy, it is one-off so those who pay it aren\u2019t driven away, it exempts many difficult-to-value objects such as family heirlooms.\u201d He said the tax was also needed to make a dent in the growing wealth inequality that was damaging the nation\u2019s cohesion and wellbeing. \u201cInequality of wealth soared during the Thatcher years. Extreme inequality tempts some in our society to opt out of Britain\u2019s shared institutions: state schools, NHS hospitals, even taxes. \u201cPrivate schooling turns inequality of outcome into inequality of opportunity \u2013 as the wealthy buy better outcomes for their children. Private hospitals insulated the wealthy from the shared experience of the decline of the NHS during the 1980s. But nothing is more corrosive to the body politic than tax avoidance.\u201d He said it \u201csticks in the craw\u201d of nurses, soldiers and small business people that others reduce their taxes \u201cthrough fictitious film schemes or Swiss bank accounts\u201d. Other European countries apply small annual taxes on wealth to supplement taxes on income and VAT, which are the exchequer\u2019s biggest sources of revenue. Thinktanks and economists have favoured wealth taxes that place an annual charge on the value of land or property. At the last election, the Labour party proposed an annual mansion tax on homes worth more than \u00a32m, to raise around \u00a31.2bn. The proposal, however, came under fire after it was revealed that between 70,000 and 100,000 homes were likely to be affected. Jarvis said the prospect of an annual tax that caught professionals along with the super-rich was politically unacceptable, leaving a one-off levy on the top 0.1% of earners as the only way of forcing the richest in society to make a decisive contribution to the UK\u2019s recovery from the financial crash. The tax would disregard employment and trading income, and focus on unearned income from property and shares. It would offer the super-rich a formula by which the level of tax was based on declared assets, but HMRC would investigate if taxpayers held assets offshore or through a complex web of company holdings. The report\u2019s author, Nick Donovan, said: \u201cThis is a detailed plan for a one-off wealth tax on those with more than \u00a310m net wealth. It is non-intrusive for those who have clearly played by the rules, but takes a stringent approach to calculating the wealth of those who may have underpaid taxes through aggressive tax avoidance.\u201d The Fabian Society\u2019s general secretary, Andrew Harrop, said: \u201cThe \u2018unique contribution\u2019 is a pragmatic measure that can be used to reduce the deficit and build up resilience to future economic shocks. But it conveys radical intent by taking a share of the huge financial rewards the super-rich are able to generate, not from hard work but from returns on their passive wealth.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "How to end the UK's gender pay gap", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than three decades after the equal pay act, the gender pay gap still stands at about 19%, with the average British woman earning around 80p for every \u00a31 earned by a man. David Cameron believes he has a few ways to narrow the gulf and has vowed to eliminate it \u201cin a generation\u201d. But for many people that is clearly too long to wait. There is little that employees can do for themselves to secure equal pay overnight, but what is there to stop their employers simply wiping out any disparity at their firms in one fell swoop? Nothing, it turns out. New government rules are coming in that will force bigger employers to publish their pay gap. The idea is to name and shame the worst offenders, but there are no legal requirements for employers to actually close the gap. But here\u2019s a simple idea: an organisation that finds there is a pay gap between its male and female employees could just raise women\u2019s pay. That is exactly what one London start-up has done. What\u2019s more, it plans to repeat the exercise every year. Marketing agency Brainlabs analysed pay across its 40 or so staff and found a difference of 8.6% between average men\u2019s and women\u2019s salaries. So it raised women\u2019s salaries by an average of 8.6%. Managers consulted with all the staff first and gave them three options: do nothing; raise women\u2019s salaries by an average 8.6%; or, give male employees a pay cut. The issue was put to a vote and the consensus was to raise women\u2019s pay (no one went for the third option). There were some objections \u2013 including the argument that there are not as many women to choose from in the tech industry to fill senior roles, according to Brainlabs director Sophie Newton. But for most that was no reason to leave a pay gap. Newton, a 27-year-old maths graduate, views the radical move as turning the gender pay problem on its head. Rather than waiting for policies and practical changes to level up men and women\u2019s pay over time, the employer levels the pay and then works backwards to make sure that individuals\u2019 pay represents value for money for the firm. By vowing to do the same audit and level average pay every year, Brainlabs hopes to keep everyone involved in recruitment and setting salary levels on their toes as the company grows. It now has 60 employees and will have more than 80 by the end of the year. The company is calling this annual levelling-off a \u201cpay gap tax\u201d. \u201cWe are penalising ourselves with this tax if we didn\u2019t get it right as business owners,\u201d says Newton. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, first of all there is a pay gap problem and we are going to fix that. But it\u2019s not just a pay problem, it comes down to whether the environment is fair and equal, how hiring and promotion work. We are working back to fix each one of those.\u201d Brainlabs is not alone in running out of patience. The University of Essex recently revealed it was raising female professors\u2019 pay, to bring their average salaries level with their male counterparts. It found there were no other significant pay gaps at other levels but with a one-off pay rise for professors it wants to ensure the university-wide pay gap is closed when the new academic year begins in October. The university expressed \u201cimpatience\u201d at waiting for the gap to close by other means and highlighted a widespread gender pay problem at professorial level in higher education. Similarly to Brainlabs, the university is not just raising women\u2019s pay but taking other steps to combat unconscious bias, such as ensuring senior staff encourage female professors to apply for pay rises when appropriate. It also plans regular pay audits. Time will tell if this approach works and whether other employers will be prepared to give it a try. When large companies \u2013 those with 250 or more employees \u2013 do finally begin publishing their pay gaps in 2018, the government plans to use the numbers to compile league tables. It promises to highlight sectors where pay discrepancies need tackling most. But there is a risk that just revealing big gaps will achieve little more than confirming what disgruntled workers already know. Highly qualified jobseekers might be able to shun the worst offenders, some consumers may even boycott the most inequitable brands, but it will make little difference to Britain\u2019s overall pay gap. Ministers know this, and so alongside the gender pay reporting rules they have also extended flexible working rights and brought in shared parental leave, meaning that for those families able to afford it, fathers can take time off work to care for small children. The government says the National Living Wage introduced in April will primarily help women and narrow the gender pay. The good news is that female employment rates have been rising and the pay gap has been narrowing. The bad news is that there is still ample evidence that many women are starting out their working lives on worse pay than men, partly because they are going into sectors where pay is lower overall. As long as such patterns continue the UK wide gender pay gap will endure. An analysis by the Trades Union Congress found young women with vocational qualifications earn 15% less than their male peers. That was an even bigger gender pay gap than the 10% between young men and women with academic qualifications. The organisation said the wide vocational pay gap was partly down to the fact that women work predominantly in sectors where pay is poorer and they remain a \u201crarity\u201d in better paying sectors such as engineering and construction. In 2015, just one in 40 vocational qualifications in construction were awarded to women. By contrast, in health and care, women dominated, with 64% of vocational qualifications. Gender pay reporting by itself will not change those imbalances. What is needed is better careers advice and more work to break down stereotypes. And then there is the motherhood pay penalty. For those women who do start out on similar pay levels there is still a big chance that having children will mean they end up falling behind financially. More flexible working rights are helpful, but opportunities are still too rare for men and women who want to work part-time because they have caring responsibilities. To change that will take nothing short of an revolution in employer thinking. They might know flexible working can boost morale, productivity and employee retention, but such potential gains appear to be too little incentive to prompt radical change. The same goes for equal pay. If incentives aren\u2019t working, perhaps penalties will. It\u2019s time for everyone \u2013 ministers included \u2013 to contemplate a pay gap tax.",

The idea is to name and shame the worst offenders, but there are no legal requirements for employers to actually close the gap. </p> <p>But here\u2019s a simple idea: an organisation that finds there is a pay gap between its male and female employees could just raise women\u2019s pay. </p> <p>That is exactly what one London start-up has done. What\u2019s more, it plans to repeat the exercise every year.</p> <p>Marketing agency Brainlabs analysed pay across its 40 or so staff and found a difference of 8.6% between average men\u2019s and women\u2019s salaries. So it <a href=\"http://www.brainlabsdigital.com/pay-gap/\">raised women\u2019s salaries by an average of 8.6%</a>.</p> <p>Managers consulted with all the staff first and gave them three options: do nothing; raise women\u2019s salaries by an average 8.6%; or, give male employees a pay cut.</p> <p>The issue was put to a vote and the consensus was to raise women\u2019s pay (no one went for the third option). </p> <p>There were some objections \u2013 including the argument that there are not as many women to choose from in the tech industry to fill senior roles, according to Brainlabs director Sophie Newton. But for most that was no reason to leave a pay gap.</p> <p>Newton, a 27-year-old maths graduate, views the radical move as turning the gender pay problem on its head. Rather than waiting for policies and practical changes to level up men and women\u2019s pay over time, the employer levels the pay and then works backwards to make sure that individuals\u2019 pay represents value for money for the firm. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0d9994f04546905354dee6d0c491daa0099de25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d9994f04546905354dee6d0c491daa0099de25c/0_10_489_489/489.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Newton\" width=\"489\" height=\"489\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Newton.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By vowing to do the same audit and level average pay every year, Brainlabs hopes to keep everyone involved in recruitment and setting salary levels on their toes as the company grows.

      "bodyText": "Last week was a bad one for capitalism. Two Commons committees, and an astonished outside world, watched a long list of highly paid individuals blame the downfall of BHS on everyone but themselves. Meanwhile, Mike Ashley did accept some responsibilty for goings-on at his Sports Direct but he had a mighty admission to make: some of his workers had effectively been paid less than the minimum wage. The reaction to these revelations has been enlightening. No chairman or chief executive of a FTSE 100 company has risen to express outrage. Professional bodies of accountants and lawyers have not called for a fundamental examination of ethical standards in their industries. The Daily Telegraph, in a leader column, told its readers that capitalism \u201cremains a force for good\u201d. It\u2019s as if the establishment would prefer the caravan to move along so that everyone can get back to the business of making money. Thank goodness, then, that the committee running the BHS inquiry has decided it wants more details, from more people. Last Thursday \u2013 a day after hearing the wandering testimony of Dominic Chappell, the thrice bankrupt who paid \u00a31 for BHS \u2013 it announced a fresh set of witnesses. Some 14 were called, including six who had already appeared. The 14 include three individuals from Goldman Sachs, including one of its two men in London, Michael Sherwood, who worked on Green\u2019s failed attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. It will also hear from Neville Khan, managing partner of Deloitte, and Lord Grabiner, chairman of Taveta, Green\u2019s holding company. These are very big cheeses. The more testimonies, the better, because two points are clear already from the BHS inquiry. First, Chappell was plainly insufficiently experienced to own BHS, a loss-making company with 11,000 employees and a large deficit in its pension scheme. Second, Green and Chappell could not have completed the deal if so many supposedly reputable firms and individuals had not performed their roles and lent their good names. These are crucial points if \u2013 as seems highly likely \u2013 it turns out that Green broke no rules in his selling of BHS. What is there to prevent owners of other companies with towering pension deficits selling to inexperienced purchasers? One safeguard, in theory, is regulation. But, at BHS, the sale proceeded without the approval of the Pensions Regulator. Green, supposedly frustrated by the slow and inconclusive progress of previous discussions, went ahead anyway, as he was legally entitled to do. That may be a loophole that needs to be closed. It may be that the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat financed by a levy on defined-benefit schemes, has created a perverse incentive for employers to shirk their pension responsibilities. The second safeguard is meant to be the accountants, lawyers and financial advisers. Yet law firm Olswang represented Chappell in the knowledge of at least one of his bankruptcies, and now refuses, citing client confidentiality, to say how much it was paid, or on what basis. Accountant Grant Thornton, Chappell\u2019s other key adviser, is a firm that likes to boast about its moral compass. Its new chief executive, Sacha Romanovitch, has launched a scheme called Vibrant Economy, with the aim of passing on \u201csomething better to the next generation\u201d. The 11,000 employees of BHS who lost their jobs may not laugh. Businesses will always fail, of course. But the sale of BHS to an underfunded individual with no retail experience and multiple bankruptcies is different. Green will give his account next week. After that, the Commons committees must keep pressing the advisers. None of the well-paid handmaidens to the transaction seems to have stopped to examine adequately the wider moral picture. With this in mind \u2013 and if a reformed pension system is still full of holes \u2013 the crisis in the corporate world runs much deeper than the inevitability of occasional accidents. Coasting Uber could step on the gas after nod from Brussels Given the sheer volume of court rulings that have gone against Uber lately, it would be no surprise to find that the world\u2019s judiciaries have been infiltrated by a cadre of disgruntled black cab drivers.

Brent crude is up \u2013 but Big Oil still isn\u2019t back in the black The oil price has hit $52 a barrel in recent days, which represents a 70% cost bounce-back since the middle of February. So are Shell, BP and the North Sea industry back in business now? And will car owners and other oil and gas consumers be put on the back foot? Can one expect to see crude values running up again to the $100 a barrel levels seen for the three years preceding June 2014? Perhaps: there is reason to believe that the bottom of this particularly brutal commodity cycle has indeed been reached. Most analysts are gently optimistic that the Brent crude benchmark will be back above $60 by year end, but see no reason to suppose it will be much higher for 2017 or much beyond. Last week Shell unveiled deeper cutbacks following its successful tie-up with rival BG, while BP hived off its \u00a31bn Norwegian business to a new venture with a local independent called Det Norske.

      "body": "<p>Last week was a bad one for capitalism. Two Commons committees, and an astonished outside world, watched a long list of highly paid individuals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony\" title=\"\">blame the downfall of BHS on everyone but themselves</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony\" title=\"\">Mike Ashley did accept some responsibilty for goings-on at his Sports Direct</a> but he had a mighty admission to make: some of his workers had effectively been paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>The reaction to these revelations has been enlightening. No chairman or chief executive of a FTSE 100 company has risen to express outrage. Professional bodies of accountants and lawyers have not called for a fundamental examination of ethical standards in their industries. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, in a leader column, told its readers that capitalism \u201cremains a force for good\u201d. It\u2019s as if the establishment would prefer the caravan to move along so that everyone can get back to the business of making money.</p> <p>Thank goodness, then, that the committee running the BHS inquiry has decided it wants more details, from more people. Last Thursday \u2013 a day after hearing the wandering testimony of Dominic Chappell, the thrice bankrupt who paid \u00a31 for BHS \u2013 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/09/bhs-collapse-could-cost-public-around-35m-philip-green-dominic-chappell\" title=\"\">announced a fresh set of witnesses</a>. Some 14 were called, including six who had already appeared.</p> <p>The 14 include three individuals from Goldman Sachs, including one of its two men in London, Michael Sherwood, who worked on Green\u2019s failed attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. It will also hear from Neville Khan, managing partner of Deloitte, and Lord Grabiner, chairman of Taveta, Green\u2019s holding company. These are very big cheeses.</p> <p>The more testimonies, the better, because two points are clear already from the BHS inquiry. First, Chappell was plainly insufficiently experienced to own BHS, a loss-making company with 11,000 employees and a large deficit in its pension scheme. Second, Green and Chappell could not have completed the deal if so many supposedly reputable firms and individuals had not performed their roles and lent their good names.</p> <p>These are crucial points if \u2013 as seems highly likely \u2013 it turns out that Green broke no rules in his selling of BHS. What is there to prevent owners of other companies with towering pension deficits selling to inexperienced purchasers?</p> <p>One safeguard, in theory, is regulation. But, at BHS, the sale proceeded without the approval of the Pensions Regulator. Green, supposedly frustrated by the slow and inconclusive progress of previous discussions, went ahead anyway, as he was legally entitled to do. That may be a loophole that needs to be closed. It may be that the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat financed by a levy on defined-benefit schemes, has created a perverse incentive for employers to shirk their pension responsibilities.</p> <p>The second safeguard is meant to be the accountants, lawyers and financial advisers. Yet law firm Olswang represented Chappell in the knowledge of at least one of his bankruptcies, and now refuses, citing client confidentiality, to say how much it was paid, or on what basis. Accountant Grant Thornton, Chappell\u2019s other key adviser, is a firm that likes to boast about its moral compass. Its new chief executive, Sacha Romanovitch, has launched a scheme called Vibrant Economy, with the aim of passing on \u201csomething better to the next generation\u201d. The 11,000 employees of BHS who lost their jobs may not laugh.</p> <p>Businesses will always fail, of course. But the sale of BHS to an underfunded individual with no retail experience and multiple bankruptcies is different. Green will give his account next week. After that, the Commons committees must keep pressing the advisers.</p> <p>None of the well-paid handmaidens to the transaction seems to have stopped to examine adequately the wider moral picture. With this in mind \u2013 and if a reformed pension system is still full of holes \u2013 the crisis in the corporate world runs much deeper than the inevitability of occasional accidents.</p> <h2>Coasting Uber could step on the gas after nod from Brussels</h2> <p>Given the sheer volume of court rulings that have gone against Uber lately, it would be no surprise to find that the world\u2019s judiciaries have been infiltrated by a cadre of disgruntled black cab drivers.</p> <p>The California-based taxi app has now fallen foul of courts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/uber-suffers-legal-setbacks-in-france-and-germany\" title=\"\">Germany, France,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/26/uber-pop-italy-order-discontinue-unfair-competition-taxi\" title=\"\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/09/uber-taxis-ban-spain-thailand\" title=\"\">Spain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/17/uber-dutch-police-launch-criminal-investigation\" title=\"\">the Netherlands</a> and Belgium \u2013 and that\u2019s just in Europe. Judges in Brazil and India have also thrown brass tacks under the wheels of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\" title=\"\">Uber</a> juggernaut, which has been rapidly gathering speed since the company was founded in 2009.</p> <p>One of the chief complaints is that its lower-cost UberPop service \u2013 now banned in a handful of countries \u2013 relies on drivers who do not have a licence to operate private hire vehicles. This angered traditional taxi drivers, whose lobby groups have found allies among the political classes.</p> <p>In France, Uber was found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/french-court-fines-uber-for-running-illegal-taxi-service\" title=\"\">guilty of running an illegal taxi service</a>, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of two years for executives held responsible. They avoided jail but, in a measure of the strength of anti-Uber sentiment in France, two executives had to pay combined fines of \u20ac50,000.</p> <p>But there may be hope for Uber in Europe. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/02/eu-commission-backs-sharing-economy-uber-airbnb\" title=\"\">European commission recently issued guidelines</a> stating that \u201csharing economy\u201d businesses such as Uber and Airbnb should be banned only as a last resort. It hinted that it could call upon these guidelines when determining whether national legislation violates EU treaties.</p> <p>So far, Uber has tended to drop its UberPop service rather than fight its corner: it relies for income instead on its more upmarket chauffeur-style services, which use fully licensed drivers.</p> <p>But the company has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/uber-assembles-advisory-board-of-international-power-brokers\" title=\"\">many friends in high places</a> and the thinly veiled message of support from the European commission may well embolden chief executive Travis Kalanick. If the commission continues to lean towards backing Uber, he will at some stage feel ready to test those bans in the highest European courts. And that could lead to a head-on collision.</p> <h2>Brent crude is up \u2013 but Big Oil still isn\u2019t back in the black</h2> <p>The oil price has hit $52 a barrel in recent days, which represents a 70% cost bounce-back since the middle of February.</p> <p>So are Shell, BP and the North Sea industry back in business now? And will car owners and other oil and gas consumers be put on the back foot? Can one expect to see crude values running up again to the $100 a barrel levels seen for the three years preceding June 2014?</p> <p>Perhaps: there is reason to believe that the bottom of this particularly brutal commodity cycle has indeed been reached. Most analysts are gently optimistic that the Brent crude benchmark will be back above $60 by year end, but see no reason to suppose it will be much higher for 2017 or much beyond.</p> <p>Last week Shell unveiled deeper cutbacks following its successful tie-up with rival BG, while BP hived off its \u00a31bn Norwegian business to a new venture with a local independent called Det Norske. Big Oil is still living beyond its means.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brexit is pointless \u2013 utterly pointless. It cannot even be distinguished by the label \u201cproject\u201d, because the Brexit people are unable tell us with an ounce of conviction what they have in store. The essence of their campaign is entirely negative: keep out immigrants \u2013 although some of the more prominent Brexiters, in common with so many of us, are descended from immigrants \u2013 and take a leap into the economic and trading unknown. The supply chains of so much business are now trans-European, but these would be needlessly disrupted as the nation turned in on itself. No wonder the markets are unsettled; and those of us with long memories know that when markets become seriously unsettled, it is difficult to prevent things from getting totally out of hand. One of the ironies of the recent turn of events is that, after the Remain side thought they had had the better of the economic argument, they became concerned that the Brexit camp had given up on that front and began to play the race card. They \u2013 we \u2013 are right to be concerned about the race card. But my own researches indicate that victory in the economic argument was not as decisive as some of my fellow Remain spirits believed. Personally, I accept the economic argument wholeheartedly. The idea of leaving the single market and then renegotiating is patently absurd, as is the fantasy that, without even a British member on the seven-person appellate body that resolves World Trade Organisation disputes, the Brexit gang can negotiate everything to the UK\u2019s advantage. Trade negotiations take decades, and, of all the skills shortages in the UK, the shortage of experienced trade negotiators is probably the most acute. But there appears to have been a backlash against the forces of the economic and political establishment, national and international. These have \u2013 to my mind, quite rightly \u2013 been warning about the potentially dire consequences of Brexit, but are generally thought to have overdone it. Although the British and international officials and economists who produce these forecasts are, in my experience, an honourable brigade, it is leading with one\u2019s chin to publish precise forecasts of the impact of Brexit on people\u2019s incomes in 2030. It was not difficult for the Brexiters to hit back at the chancellor with the marked discrepancy between his November forecasts and his March forecasts. As for George Osborne\u2019s warning that panic over Brexit might produce a collapse in house prices \u2013 well, this was intriguing: a fall in house prices is just what the younger generation wants, but not necessarily what the older, predominantly pro-Brexit, generation would be happy with. Now, it is apparent that both in this country with the onset of Ukip, in the US with the egregious Trump and continental Europe with the rise of the far right, the common factor might well be labelled \u201cglobalisation and its discontents\u201d. The other problem is dissatisfaction with elites. Many people don\u2019t like being told what to do by governments and international bureaucrats. It was plainly with this in mind that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, recently criticised London mayor Sadiq Khan for appearing on a Remain platform with David Cameron. I have the unfashionable view that McDonnell is a formidable political operator who should not be underestimated. My worry is that every time he impresses one with salient criticism of Osborne\u2019s austerity policies, he then goes and blows it by, for example, appearing to advocate civil disobedience, or with this recent example of criticism of Khan\u2019s decision to sit alongside Cameron. The fact of the matter is that the outcome of this referendum \u2013 the calling of which was the ultimate political folly of Cameron\u2019s leadership \u2013 is so important for the future of our nation that it transcends conventional political squabbles. It is a commonplace that Jeremy Corbyn and McDonnell are from the extreme-left, Eurosceptic wing of the Labour party. They have been slow to follow the good example of those great men before them, namely Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, who voted Leave in the 1975 referendum but subsequently rose above that position, and realised how important, for all the EU\u2019s flaws, was the goal of keeping Europe united and avoiding the horrors of the disunited interwar period after 1918. More recently, there have been signs that the relatively new Labour leadership has begun to realise the importance of the social protection aspects of the EU \u2013 rights which could well be torn to shreds by rightwing zealots such as Alexander (Boris) Johnson, Michael Gove and their motley crew after Brexit. So far, however, the general impression is that the Labour leaders have been reluctant and half-hearted about their conversion to the European cause. And there are a lot of doubters among Labour voters affected by discontent over globalisation. It would be an act of genuine statesmanship if Corbyn and McDonnell could throw themselves into the campaign to convince the doubters that the European Union is better than the alternative. It was the veteran pollster Sir Robert Worcester who recently told me: \u201cDon\u2019t-knows don\u2019t vote.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s appearance in front of MPs this Wednesday was always going to be the highlight of the parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS. Now the stakes have been raised after the work and pensions committee announced it was calling in Green\u2019s retinue to give evidence. The lucky invitees include Michael Sherwood, Green\u2019s main contact at Goldman Sachs; Neville Kahn, his long-time adviser at the accountants Deloitte; and the restaurateur and Tory donor Richard Caring, who used to own shares in BHS. There are also recalls for Anthony Gutman of Goldman and Lord Grabiner, among others. A group of MPs is seeking to remove Green\u2019s knighthood unless he puts hundreds of millions of pounds into BHS\u2019s pension scheme, so the pressure is on for a man who protects his reputation fiercely. With Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from Green for \u00a31, largely discredited, the committee\u2019s work looks like turning into a judgment on Green. To give Green credit, he hasn\u2019t tried to escape the inquisition, only wavering when the committee chairman, Frank Field, appeared to prejudge the outcome. Expect a pugnacious performance: but with all those advisers lined up to appear, Green\u2019s answers need to be watertight or he\u2019ll be back in the MPs\u2019 dock. Bank may break silence on Brexit With a week until the EU referendum, no one expects the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to make any change to interest rates when it announces its policy decision on Thursday. But what of the minutes of the rate-setting meeting, released at the same time? The civil service went into purdah over the referendum late last month, 28 days before the vote. The Bank isn\u2019t part of the civil service but it has chosen to abide by the same rules. However, the MPC minutes are classed as a regular publication and are therefore exempt. Mark Carney, the governor, told MPs the MPC would comment on the referendum in the minutes if it was relevant to its inflation target. Carney has already taken political flak over the Bank\u2019s judgments about the economy in the event of Brexit, so one might expect the MPC to hold off from any comments likely to inflame controversy so close to the vote. But Carney was clearly furious when Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Leaver, accused him of doing George Osborne\u2019s bidding and called for his resignation. The MPC might be inclined to display its resistance to such pressure if it has fresh thoughts on Brexit. Special guest in Liverpool The EU referendum has provided a boost for Liverpool\u2019s festival of business, which kicks off on Monday. Speakers on the first day are a Remain-heavy bunch, including Sir Terry Leahy, the former Tesco boss, and John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow. But lead billing at the biannual event goes to an anonymous senior cabinet minister. With business secretary Sajid Javid already on the list, it looks like the mystery figure will be George Osborne or David Cameron, who gave the keynote speech in 2014. Whoever it is will apparently use the opportunity to press the business case for staying in the European Union. Liverpool provides an ideal setting for such a speech, with the Remain campaign flagging and desperately needing Labour voters \u2013 many of them in the north \u2013 to back EU membership on 23 June. Whoever turns up, the most heavyweight political figure will be Lord Heseltine, who visited Liverpool after the 1981 riots and worked to regenerate the city. Javid might want to discuss his conversion to industrial activism over the steel crisis with Heseltine, whose pledge to \u201cintervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner\u201d was at odds with laissez-faire Thatcherism.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Philip Green\u2019s appearance in front of MPs this Wednesday was always going to be the highlight of the parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS. Now the stakes have been raised after the work and pensions committee announced it was calling in Green\u2019s retinue to give evidence.</p> <p>The lucky invitees include Michael Sherwood, Green\u2019s main contact at Goldman Sachs; Neville Kahn, his long-time adviser at the accountants Deloitte; and the restaurateur and Tory donor Richard Caring, who used to own shares in BHS. There are also recalls for Anthony Gutman of Goldman and Lord Grabiner, among&#xa0;others.</p> <p>A group of MPs is seeking to remove Green\u2019s knighthood unless he puts hundreds of millions of pounds into BHS\u2019s pension scheme, so the pressure is on for a man who protects his reputation fiercely. With Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from Green for \u00a31, largely discredited, the committee\u2019s work looks like turning into a judgment on Green.</p> <p>To give Green credit, he hasn\u2019t tried to escape the inquisition, only wavering when the committee chairman, Frank Field, appeared to prejudge the outcome. Expect a pugnacious performance: but with all those advisers lined up to appear, Green\u2019s answers need to be watertight or he\u2019ll be back in the MPs\u2019 dock.</p> <h2>Bank may break silence on Brexit</h2> <p>With a week until the EU referendum, no one expects the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to make any change to interest rates when it announces its policy decision on Thursday. But what of the minutes of the rate-setting meeting, released at the same time? The civil service went into purdah over the referendum late last month, 28 days before the vote. The Bank isn\u2019t part of the civil service but it has chosen to abide by the same rules. However, the MPC minutes are classed as a regular publication and are therefore exempt.</p> <p>Mark Carney, the governor, told MPs the MPC would comment on the referendum in the minutes if it was relevant to its inflation target. Carney has already taken political flak over the Bank\u2019s judgments about the economy in the event of Brexit, so one might expect the MPC to hold off from any comments likely to inflame controversy so close to the vote.</p> <p>But Carney was clearly furious when Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Leaver, accused him of doing George Osborne\u2019s bidding and called for his resignation. The MPC might be inclined to display its resistance to such pressure if it has fresh thoughts on Brexit.</p> <h2>Special guest in Liverpool</h2> <p>The EU referendum has provided a boost for Liverpool\u2019s festival of business, which kicks off on Monday. Speakers on the first day are a Remain-heavy bunch, including Sir Terry Leahy, the former Tesco boss, and John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow.</p> <p>But lead billing at the biannual event goes to an anonymous senior cabinet minister. With business secretary Sajid Javid already on the list, it looks like the mystery figure will be George Osborne or David Cameron, who gave the keynote speech in 2014.</p> <p>Whoever it is will apparently use the opportunity to press the business case for staying in the European Union. Liverpool provides an ideal setting for such a speech, with the Remain campaign flagging and desperately needing Labour voters \u2013 many of them in the north \u2013 to back EU membership on 23&#xa0;June.</p> <p>Whoever turns up, the most heavyweight political figure will be Lord Heseltine, who visited Liverpool after the 1981 riots and worked to regenerate the city. Javid might want to discuss his conversion to industrial activism over the steel crisis with Heseltine, whose pledge to \u201cintervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner\u201d was at odds with laissez-faire Thatcherism.</p>",
