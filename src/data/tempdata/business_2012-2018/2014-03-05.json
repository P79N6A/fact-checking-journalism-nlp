      "bodyText": "Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays have handed their bosses almost \u00a31m in shares to sidestep the new rules from Brussels which are intended to clampdown on bankers' pay. Similar handouts, which have become known in the City as \"allowances\", will be given to about 1,000 staff at Barclays and some 75 bankers at Lloyds. Barclays is facing outcry about its increased bonus payouts, which are being awarded despite a sharp fall in profits in 2013. Barclays has agreed a \u00a318,000-a-week shares payout for its chief executive Antony Jenkins, who earns a salary of \u00a31.1m a year. Lloyds' boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio is getting almost the same size allowance, after receiving a total pay package of \u00a37.5m last year. The new allowances at Barclays and Lloyds follow a move by HSBC last month to hand its boss, Stuart Gulliver, \u00a31.7m in shares a year to get around the bonus cap, which the EU introduced on 1 Januaryand the chancellor George Osborne is fighting in the courts. Barclays' annual report shows it also paid 481 of its staff more than \u00a31m last year \u2013 up from 428 in 2012. Eight workers were handed more than \u00a35m. However, more than half of the bank's total workforce of 140,000 earned less than \u00a325,000. Jenkins said Barclays had to pay higher bonuses to avoid a \"death spiral\" at the bank \u2013 because staff would walk out if they did not get bigger pay deals. At Lloyds 27 were paid more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000). Both banks fuelled the row over industry response to the EU bonus cap by announcing they would now ask their shareholders to support bonuses of 200% of salary \u2013 double the maximum payout level intended by the EU, which wants to limit bonuses to 100% of salaries \u2013 at their upcoming annual meetings. \"Taxpayers and ordinary bank workers will rightly view this as an act of contempt for the sacrifices they made since the financial crisis,\" said Rob Macgregor, national officer of the Unite union. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"The banks shouldn't be spending hours working out how to get around the bonus rules drawn up by the EU to avoid a repeat of the bad behaviour which caused the crash. Instead, senior bankers should accept that now is the time for moderation, not excess, and concentrate on lending to small businesses and paying back their debt to society.\" Jenkins' \u00a3950,000 allowance comes after a year in which he cashed in \u00a35.2m of previous share awards and was awarded another \u00a34m in bonus shares which could pay out in the years ahead. Last year he pledged to reform the bonus culture at the bank after the departure of his predecessor Bob Diamond in July 2012. He has since been urging staff to attest to the new \"Barclays Way\" \u2013 a set of cultural guidelines \u2013 although one in six have failed to sign up. Jenkins has been under pressure as the higher payouts were made after a year in which Barclays' profits slumped to \u00a35.2bn. The bank paid just \u00a355m in UK corporation tax. Jenkins infuriated Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, by criticising calls for bonuses to be deferred over 10 years. \"The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed. It will now be up to regulators to do the job,\" Tyrie said. The move by Lloyds to ask for backing for bonuses of 200% of salary puts the UK government \u2013 facing allegations that it is allowing banks to breach the EU rules \u2013 on the spot. It owns 33% of Lloyds shares through UK Financial Investments and could come under pressure from the public to use that stake to block any bonuses of more than 100%. UKFI refused to say if it would back the proposal from Lloyds, or any that might be put forward by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Treasury said only that it was assessing Lloyds' plans and that it had not received any proposals from 81% taxpayer owned RBS. As it published its annual report for 2013, Lloyds said it would claw back more bonuses from previous years as a result of near \u00a310bn of provisions it has been forced to set aside to cover the cost of mis-selling payment protection insurance. It is understood that former boss Eric Daniels has now had to repay his entire 2010 bonus of \u00a31.4m.Four other former directors have also had to repay bonuses, as well as a handful of other staff still employed by the bank. Banks are also required to disclose the number of \"code staff\" they employ \u2013 those who are deemed to take and manage risks. At Barclays 530 employees who fall into his bracket - up from 393 a year ago - and they received an average of \u00a31.4m each. Barclays hired a new finance director, Tushar Morzaria, last year after Chris Lucas left on health grounds. Morzaria, recruited from JP Morgan, received a \u00a31.2m bonus despite joining in October while Lucas received \u00a3500,000. One unidentified Barclays employee received a pay-off of \u00a33m. Small print in the Lloyds annual report shows that the new head of risk, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, received \u00a33.1m in 2013 and is entitled to a lump sum of \u00a3718,996 when he reaches retirement age or leaves due to ill-health.",

On the fifth anniversary of base rates falling to their current historic low, these trends could play a crucial role in the Bank of England's debate over the cost of borrowing and when to raise it. Threadneedle Street is reluctant to push up interest rates until at least next year. But analysis of employment trends by the Office for National Statistics shows that the labour market is tightening. Older workers, and especially women over the age of 50, have returned to the workforce in greater numbers than at any time in a generation, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. While the over-50s may be going back to work, younger people have withdrawn from the workforce in greater numbers than for several decades \u2013 in what many would regard as a sensible move back into education. Some employers have begun to talk about skills shortages, and manufacturing wages have been rising for some time at double the national rate of 1.1%. Recruitment agencies have produced analysis showing that a lack of candidates in key areas, such as accountancy, is already driving wages rises above the inflation rate, which has fallen to 1.9%. But while falling unemployment and a higher participation rate indicate a low level of slack in the economy, the increased use of part-time workers in the service industries, with many likely to be on flexible or zero-hour contracts, has kept productivity lower than in previous recoveries. Britain's largest business sector, accounting for three-quarters of activity, is under-employing its staff and has plenty of scope to increase output without triggering inflation-busting wage rises. So, far from being clear, the ONS report sends Bank of England governor Mark Carney a mixed message. The Bank has put forward a thesis that the UK's output gap is around 1.5%, which is more conservative than some consultancies, which pitch it nearer 5%, but higher than the 0%-0.5% some believe nearer the mark. Economists try to estimate the extent of the output gap because it gives a guide as to how near the economy is to full capacity. They estimate how near businesses are to buying new equipment and how near workers are to regaining the power to push up wages, both of which could increase pressure on prices. Under this regime, the only way to cool prices is to raise rates. The City expects the Bank to start raising rates next year, but the ONS gives Carney plenty of scope to argue that Britain is underperforming, with plenty of scope for most, if not all, employers to increase output without affecting inflation. And an increase in economic activity over the next couple of years could be sustained should younger people return to the workforce, migrants keep arriving and the unemployed find a way to retrain.",

That was 53 more than in 2012. At the top of the tree, eight individuals got more than \u00a35m, and another 54 earned between \u00a32.5m and \u00a35m. Again, those tallies were higher than in 2012. Overall, the bonus pool was increased from \u00a32.2bn to \u00a32.4bn. If this division of spoils \u2013 bumper hand-outs for senior staff while shareholders get scraps \u2013 strikes you as a distortion of capitalism, you are not alone. Even the Institute of Directors, the bosses' club, is flabbergasted that Barclays has the nerve to hand out bonuses worth three times the dividend pay-out to shareholders. \"For whom is this institution being run?\" it wonders. Quite. Chief executive Antony Jenkins' answer is that shareholders would be in an even worse spot if Barclays hadn't paid up. The investment banking division, where the big bucks are made, faced a \"death spiral\" of staff defections that was avoided only by awarding bigger bonuses despite the division's 37% slump in profits, he says. Resignations in the US were running at twice the previous year's rate, pleads the bank's pay chief Sir John Sunderland. These pay decisions are \"extremely difficult,\" intones \u00a3750,000-a-year non-executive chairman Sir David Walker. What's truly difficult, however, is to understand how Barclays hopes to meet its high-minded pledges to reform pay in the interests of the owners. The bond traders and supposed superstar deal-doers have the board over a barrel. When profits fall, they want bigger bonuses not to defect to JP Morgan, Citigroup or a hedge fund. When profits rise, it's down to the individuals' brilliance and they demand to be paid accordingly. As ever with Barclays, a happy land is promised around the next corner. Profits, with the help of technology, will recover; the investment bank will earn returns on equity greater than Barclays' cost of equity for a change; and the principle of \"pay for performance\" can be re-introduced from a new base. That's the theory. In practice, Jenkins has no more than a year to show he is living in the real world. Talk of a \"death spiral\" is desperate stuff. A chief executive can play that get-out card only once. Without an improvement in profits from investment banking, the only alternative will be to retreat from areas where Barclays is losing to big Wall Street firms. As matters stand, the division is dragging down the share price. Barclays, with a strong UK retail business and the excellent Barclaycard operation, is valued at just 0.8 times its book value. Lloyds, which doesn't have an investment bank, trades at 1.6 times. Meanwhile, Jenkins has chosen this moment to pick a fight over bonuses with the chairman of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, whose Banking Commission said some remuneration should be deferred for ten years to align rewards with the maturity of risk. Jenkins thinks deferral levels in the UK are already among the highest in the world, making it hard for him \"to attract the right talent.\" Tyrie responded dryly by saying \"it is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year's bonus round\" and that \"the new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed.\" No prizes for guessing who he had in mind. A year ago, Jenkins was the new-broom boss who would clean up Barclays. Now he appears as powerless as his predecessors to resist the bonus grabs. He is irritating politicians, and possibly the Bank of England too, with his objection to lengthy deferrals. And he can't point to a rising share price to pacify investors. \"2014 will be a critical year for Barclays,\" says Walker. You bet. Another year like 2013 and even the supine shareholders may conclude they're being taken for a ride.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking group has issued guarded advice that Scottish independence could have a \"material impact\" on its costs and borrowing, potentially driving costs up for its businesses and customers. In its annual report, Lloyds said the impact of a yes vote in September's referendum was uncertain, but that it could have a direct impact on its borrowing costs, tax position and costs of working under two different regulatory systems. Its cautionary notes are more muted than the explicit statements from RBS and the finance group Standard Life last month concerning their fears of independence having a \"significant impact\" on their business. However, it emerged that senior Lloyds executives believe they would have to move their group-registered office from Edinburgh to London under an EU directive which states that insurers and banks must have their head offices and registered offices in the same member state. Opposition parties in the Scottish parliament claimed that these developments showed a growing number of large employers were worried about the referendum, while Scotland's government insisted that many of the fears would be dealt with if the UK government agreed to a formal currency and banking union. Iain Gray, Labour's Scottish finance spokesman, said: \"The SNP can no longer continue to just put their fingers in their ears and claim that they do not really mean it. To simply dismiss these warnings is to treat the fears of Scottish workers in these companies with contempt.\" Last month, the new TSB bank, hived off from Lloyds to increase competition in retail banking, was established with its headquarters in London, despite being founded in Scotland. The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, said sources at Lloyds, and City regulators, had disclosed that they were taking legal advice about the 1995 EU directive on insurance, investment and credit providers, which so far remained untested in the courts and had no case law linked to it. Although only a small number of jobs are tied to Lloyds' registered office in Edinburgh, bank executives believe there is a clear logic to the directive's policy, since Scotland and the UK would be separate states after independence, with Scotland's future status as a new EU member state still unclear. Lloyds has set up working groups to investigate the possible impacts of independence; these are run by its Scottish executive committee at its small, largely symbolic, registered office at the Mound in Edinburgh, overseen by the banking executive Philip Grant. Lloyds said its \"key mitigating actions\" were to investigate \"the potential impact on the group's business and impact on customers of a vote in favour of Scottish independence\". Lloyds is taking a more cautious approach than Edinburgh-based RBS, which said last month that a yes vote could \"significantly impact the group's credit ratings and could also impact the fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory landscape to which the group is subject\". It is understood Lloyds would wait until there was a yes vote this September before making more explicit statements about its fears or interests post-independence, given that there would be at least 18 months of negotiations before Scotland became a separate state. The bank is not expected to follow Standard Life, which is one of Scotland's largest employers but does 90% of its business in the rest of the UK. Standard Life said last week it could move large chunks of its operations to England if independence left it facing greater costs and problems with a currency and finance sector regulation.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay's controversial corporate raid on the hotel group behind Claridges has been dealt a severe blow after the last independent shareholder, Irish property developer Paddy McKillen, won the financial backing of US private equity group Colony Capital. The shock move transforms McKillen's stretched financial position, allowing him to restore more than \u20ac250m (\u00a3200m) of overdue borrowings within his broader property empire to financial health, supported by fresh loans from the $31bn US investment group. It also pitches Colony \u2013 which co-owns Miramax and Fairmont Raffles Hotels with the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and others \u2013 against the Barclays in a major counter-challenge to their long-running battle for control of Coroin, the company that owns Claridges as well as The Connaught and The Berkeley hotels. Colony already knows the hotel group well, having owned it jointly with Blackstone before it sold out to McKillen and fellow Irish investors in a 2006 deal heavily financed with bank debt, much of it from Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland. Colony boss Tom Barrack yesterday said he had spotted a \"mispricing opportunity\" in McKillen's overdue borrowings, which the Irishman had been unable to refinance for years. The investment group and the Irish property developer have written to the Barclay family indicating they want to buy its interest in Coroin. They have not received a reply. A spokesman for the Barclays issued a short statement, saying \"nothing has changed\" except the name of lenders to McKillen. For three years the Barclays \u2013 best known as owners of the Telegraph newspaper titles, the Ritz hotel and Littlewoods \u2013 have been stalking McKillen's distressed loans, looking to acquire them from what was Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish lender nationalised in 2009 and last year transferred to liquidators. Had the twins got hold of his borrowings, McKillen feared they would have immediately called them in default, forcing McKillen to hand control to the Barclays. The long-running feud has seen McKillen spend millions in the courts challenging the Barclays' corporate raiding tactics. Despite failing to persuade the courts that the twins had breached the terms of a Coroin shareholder agreement, McKillen has refused to sell out.

      "bodyText": "Booming stock markets and global economic recovery continued the seemingly inexorable rise in the numbers of the world's super-rich last year, according to a report that predicts their ranks will swell by nearly 30% to 215,000 over the next decade. The world's so-called \"ultra high net worth individuals\" \u2013 those with $30m (\u00a321m) or more in assets apart from their main home \u2013 number 167,669, according to a report from estate agents Knight Frank \u2013 up 59% over the past decade. Roughly equal to the population of the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 and many of them do indeed have a place there \u2013 they control more than $20tn in assets \u2013 more than the national output of the US and Germany put together. London was home to more UHNWIs (4,224) than any other city in 2013 and this will still be the case a decade later, with nearly 5,000 expected to be living there, according to the report. Singapore and New York will leapfrog Tokyo and Hong Kong to take second and third places. The top six cities have more UHNWIs living in them than Latin America and the Middle East combined. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said the cluster of businesses, international appeal, heritage and democratic institutions in London and New York are not easy to replicate. But, he said, \"London wins over New York: It's more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it's a more global city.\" Britain is the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although the US is still more popular with the Asian wealth elite. Russia has seen an outflow of ultra-rich individuals to places like London, New York and Dubai. Pippa Malmgren, ex-economic adviser to George Bush, said: \"I would argue that the UK has now emerged as the world's most attractive residence for non-domiciles. The crackdown on tax havens in Switzerland has removed these old options for new capital. As a result, there has been a huge influx of global capital into the UK \u2013 and this is reflected in many things, including property prices.\" In coming decades both London and New York could be eclipsed by Asian cities, where luxury property markets are booming. The numbers of super-rich are forecast to double in Africa and India in the next decade. In China the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will soar by 80%. Bailey said: \"History, location and their long established wealth mean London and New York's positions look unassailable, at least for now. It is further down our leader board that the real city wars are being waged. The main battleground is Asia, where a handful of locations are slugging it out in the hope of establishing a clear lead as the region's alpha urban hub.\" Asian cities, led by Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, experienced the fastest growth in property prices last year, but some of the cities affected by the 2008 downturn \u2013 such as Dublin, where prime property soared 17.5% last year \u2013 are now on the road to recovery. As well as swanky estate agents and yacht builders, all this is music to the ears of the big jewellers, auction houses and most prestigious wine estates. The ultra-rich like to spend their wealth on jewellery, especially in emerging markets, followed by art, watches, wine and cars, a survey for the report found. Bailey said space travel and asteroid mining were hot investments, with 70 billionaires putting money into space or sub-orbital flights. Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic plans its first space flight this year, holds out the prospect of travelling from London to Sydney in a couple of hours \u2013 allowing Chinese or Indian investors to pop over to their Tuscan farmhouse on a whim. How they spend it Superyachts and private jets Superyachts \u2013 defined as those longer than 60 metres \u2013 and private jets are the preserve of the seriously rich and last April saw the launch of the world's biggest, the 180-metre Azzam. With a reputed price tag of \u00a3400m, it is widely understood to have been built for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi. The market for smaller yachts is only just returning to normal. Private jet sales also bounced back in the second half of 2013. Luxury brands Boston Consulting Group calculated earlier this year that the world's wealthiest spent \u00a31.1tn on luxury goods and services. Very little of that money would have been spent in Africa but the continent is expected to see the greatest growth in spending, along with the Middle East. Growth in luxury brand outlets is slowing in Asia, as the Chinese government cracks down on conspicuous consumption and many rich residents shop abroad. Rare stamps and coins Coins are becoming more popular in China, India and Russia. Gold Roman coins are particularly sought after. A 1794 US \"Flowing Hair Silver Dollar\" fetched a record $10m at auction in New York a year ago. Rare stamp values are also rising: The Stanley Gibbons China 200 rare stamp index climbed 36% between 2011 and 2012. Classic cars Classic car values are up 28% over the past 12 months, according to the Historic Automobile Group's Top Index. Not only the most famous marques are doing well: one of the biggest movers last year was Japan's first supercar, a Toyota 2000 GT from the late 1960s. Jewellery and art Gold prices are falling, but the best untreated stones \u2013 particularly 'fancy' diamonds and other coloured stones \u2013 are fetching record sums. Natural saltwater pearls, amber, coral and jade are also in demand. Contemporary and postwar works set new records last year, according to Art Market research: Francis Bacon's Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold for $143m at Christies in New York in October \u2013 a record for any artwork. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 6 March 2014 to clarify that it is the Chinese government which has been cracking down on conspicuous consumption.",

The dedicated whistleblower phone line, operating in 48 countries, comes in response to a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into allegations that the UK firm paid multimillion bribes in Indonesia and China. Rolls' chief executive, John Rishton, said the \"confidential reporting line\" was designed to \"make sure that we can hear about and address any matters of concern\".

      "bodyText": "British companies hired staff at the fastest rate in 16 years in February, as growth in orders and broader economic recovery fuelled confidence. The Markit employment index, combining the latest survey data from the services, manufacturing and construction sectors, rose to 56 in February from 55.7 in January, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. It was the highest since the combined series began in January 1998, achieved after all three sectors of the economy continued to recover last month with a rise in new orders and output. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the record rise in jobs was the \"most encouraging of all\". UK employment has been rising over recent months, and rose by 193,000 between October and December to 30.15 million people according to the latest official data. Analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that older workers, and especially women over the age of 50, have returned to the workforce in greater numbers than at any time in the past 40 years, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. It is likely that falling household incomes and the prospect of an impoverished old age have driven many of the over 50s to reconsider early retirement or stopping work to look after grandchildren. The return of older workers to the jobs market and the decision of more young people to stay in education has also meant that large parts of the private and public sectors are working nearer their full capacity than a year ago, the ONS found. But running counter to this trend is the increased use of part-time workers in the services industry, with many likely to be on flexible or zero-hours contracts, which has kept productivity lower than in previous recoveries. Meanwhile Markit surveys painted a positive picture of the private sector in both the UK and the eurozone, suggesting broad economic recovery continued in the early months of 2014. Businesses in the single currency bloc grew at the fastest pace for more than two and a half years in February, led by Germany. Markit's eurozone composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which monitors activity across thousands of businesses, rose to 53.3 from 52.9 in January. Activity in Germany's private sector rose to a 33-month high, but the news was less positive for France where business reported contraction. The gulf between growth in Germany and decline in France was the \"most striking in the history of the PMI surveys with the exception of early-2013\", according to Markit. In the UK, the services sector showed strong growth in February, despite extreme weather causing severe flooding in several parts of the country. Activity in the sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy, rose for a 14th straight month, boosting confidence among services companies which rose to the highest level in almost four and a half years. While some businesses reported disruption as a result of the floods, others said the mild weather had brought customers in. The headline services PMI index edged slightly lower to 58.2 in February from 58.3 in January, but economists said there was no cause for concern about the sector's recovery. Williamson said: \"The services economy notched up yet another month of robust growth in February, a performance that is all the more remarkable given the weather-related disruptions that have hit many businesses. \"Sustained strong growth in the services sector means it remains the most important driver of the economic recovery.\" Williamson added that the combined data suggested the economy overall was on course for growth of around 0.7% in the first quarter of 2014, in line with growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Confidence in the services sector was at its highest since September 2009 in February, pushing the business expectations measure to 74.7 from 74.3 a month earlier. Economists said there was every indication the UK economy was on course for a strong year in 2014. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, said: \"The UK is heading for another strong quarter of economic growth at the start of 2014, with a strong services PMI highlighting that the risks to the consensus GDP growth forecast of 2.7% for 2014 are skewed to the upside.

It is thought G4S, which has experience of GPS tags, G4S and Serco have been banned for bidding for the tagging contract after the launch of a fraud investigation into their existing tagging contracts with the MoJ.</p> <p>Buddi's share of the \u00a31bn contract was thought to be worth \u00a3300m. The other companies involved in the project are Capita, Astrium and O2's owners, Telef\u00f3nica.</p> <p>When Grayling announced the preferred bidders in August he said it brought the introduction of the most advanced tagging scheme in the world a step closer.</p> <p>\"Today's announcement is the start of a revolution in how we supervise offenders. We are now going to be able to track offenders wherever they go 24 hours a day. And we will be able to stop them going to places we don't want them going to \u2013 like paedophiles hanging around outside schools. All of this is going to be done with world-class British technology designed and built by the kind of business we want government to work with more,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that the deal with Buddi sent an important message that the government was serious about working with small enterprises.</p> <p>A MoJ statement said: \"We have been unable to agree on certain technical and commercial aspects of the contract with Buddi to provide tags. We have therefore decided to re-compete this element of the contract to ensure we deliver an efficient service that represents best value for hardworking taxpayers while protecting the public. Though we are disappointed not to have reached a solution that meets our needs with Buddi on this contract, we remain open to working with them in the future.\" It added that they remained on track to begin rolling out the scheme by the end of the year.</p> <p>Last year, more than half the police and crime commissioners in England and Wales petitioned Grayling to allow them to order GPS tags from Buddi for their forces. His department blocked the move, saying that a national contract had to be negotiated.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "The promise of a revolution in supervising offenders with a new generation of tags that could track them 24 hours a day by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has suffered a setback with the collapse of talks this week with the small British hi-tech company that was to deliver the hardware at the centre of the scheme. The breakdown sparked a furious exchange between the justice ministry and Buddi, which is run by Sara Murray, a member of Vince Cable's \"entrepreneurs' panel\", and chaired by the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens. Buddi was given preferred-bidder status in August to provide the hardware for the \u00a31bn GPS tagging scheme with the contract to be awarded by the end of last year. But the justice ministry has now confirmed that it has started the procurement process again, claiming that Buddi has failed to show it could supply the technology to keep track of 20,000 offenders at one time within the required timetable. Buddi insists that the justice ministry wanted a product that doesn't yet exist, demanded it hand over its intellectual property on its smart tags without any guarantee it w ould not be used by other companies, and refused to pay for any further development work. Murray said the hi-tech tag that justice ministry officials want was a \"figment of their imagination\", adding that the chances of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) now delivering on their end-of-year timetable was zero. She said in a staff email, that the firm had told the MoJ they had experienced continued delays, immediate demands for lengthy documentation, and that they were not interested in paying for development work. \"They want the development of a product which does not yet exist,\" she said. \"The MoJ have been an extraordinary diversion of much of our resources for two years now and this cannot continue, and we are excited for the prospects of the business now we are free of this unproductive and frustrating relationship.\" The MoJ maintained that the collapse of talks would not produce fresh delays for a contract that was already 14 months behind schedule.

It is thought G4S, which has experience of GPS tags, G4S and Serco have been banned for bidding for the tagging contract after the launch of a fraud investigation into their existing tagging contracts with the MoJ. Buddi's share of the \u00a31bn contract was thought to be worth \u00a3300m. The other companies involved in the project are Capita, Astrium and O2's owners, Telef\u00f3nica. When Grayling announced the preferred bidders in August he said it brought the introduction of the most advanced tagging scheme in the world a step closer. \"Today's announcement is the start of a revolution in how we supervise offenders. We are now going to be able to track offenders wherever they go 24 hours a day. And we will be able to stop them going to places we don't want them going to \u2013 like paedophiles hanging around outside schools. All of this is going to be done with world-class British technology designed and built by the kind of business we want government to work with more,\" he said. He added that the deal with Buddi sent an important message that the government was serious about working with small enterprises. A MoJ statement said: \"We have been unable to agree on certain technical and commercial aspects of the contract with Buddi to provide tags. We have therefore decided to re-compete this element of the contract to ensure we deliver an efficient service that represents best value for hardworking taxpayers while protecting the public. Though we are disappointed not to have reached a solution that meets our needs with Buddi on this contract, we remain open to working with them in the future.\" It added that they remained on track to begin rolling out the scheme by the end of the year. Last year, more than half the police and crime commissioners in England and Wales petitioned Grayling to allow them to order GPS tags from Buddi for their forces. His department blocked the move, saying that a national contract had to be negotiated.",

      "bodyText": "The continuing investigation into potential rigging of foreign exchange markets took an unexpected twist on Wednesday when the Bank of England suspended a member of staff in connection with its own review of the \u00a33tn a day market and began a formal inquiry into whether its staff knew about potential market rigging. The Bank also took the unusual step of releasing minutes of meetings held over six years until a year ago between Bank officials and of a group of foreign exchange traders who met three or four years a year which indicate that the possibility of fixing the market had been discussed as along ago as 2006. A suggestion that a group of traders had told the central bank the were exchanging information about their client's positions \u2013 one of the main themes of an investigation by regulators around the globe - in 2012 had sparked the initial internal review which in turn led the suspension of the official. The Bank escalated this investigation into its own practices on Wednesday, appointing the oversight committee of the Bank's court of directors \u2013 akin to the non-executive directors on a board \u2013 to look into whether officials condoned manipulation of foreign exchange prices. Lawyers from Travers Smith will conduct the formal inquiry for the committee, which the Bank promises to publish. The law firm has already been involved in the initial review of documents, including 15,000 emails, 21,000 Bloomberg and Reuters chat room records and more than 40 hours of telephone call recordings. The review found no evidence of collusion. Nevertheless the bank said it had suspended an employee. \"The Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes\" the Bank said. \"The Bank of England does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever. The Bank has today reiterated its guidance to staff regarding management of records and escalation of important information,\" it added. Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said there needed to honesty in the foreign exchange market, where London accounts for 40% of the trade. \"The reputational risks for the Bank of England in this matter are enormous,\" McFadden said. Last month the focus turned to a meeting between key officials at the central bank and leading foreign exchange dealers in April 2012, when they discussed the way they handled trades ahead of the crucial daily setting of a benchmark in the prices of major currencies and the most closely-scrutinised fix at 4pm each day. Foreign exchange dealers had been meeting with the Bank three or four times a year since 2005 but these meetings have not taken place since February 2013, the Bank said on Wednesday. The central bank on Wednesday published minutes of all those meetings - held at restaurants across the City and attended by the major foreign exchange traders from 10 or so major banks and chaired by Bank official Martin Mallett - but had previously released brief details of the April 2012 meeting at which Bloomberg said a senior trader had made notes showing that officials did not believe it was improper to share customer orders. The benchmark \u2013 known as WM \u2013 is at the centre of a broadening investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and investigators in the US and Switzerland. It is used to price a wide range of financial products but has been called into question after suggestions traders were sharing information about orders from clients in a way that could affect the price of the benchmark. According to the minutes of the meetings of the foreign exchange committee, the bank had first discussed possible manipulation of the markets in 2006. \"It was noted that there was evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. This was not in the interest of customers if the market was forced away from where it should be when the fixing snapshot was taken. It was noted that 'fixing business' generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour,\" the minutes from July 2006 - held in the Smith's restaurant in the City - said. The matter was discussed at the highest levels within the bank at the meeting of the court - chaired by Sir David Lees but attended by governor Mark Carney - in December 2013 and focused on the \"fix\" of the benchmark at 4pm each day. \"No decision has been taken on disciplinary action against any member of Bank staff. The Bank continues to support the Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into the foreign exchange market. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Bank to make any further comment on this matter,\" the Bank said.

Risks to banks, the financial system or customers from certain decisions may not become clear for some years. The Banking Commission recommended that in these cases the rewards should be much more closely aligned to the maturity of the risk, with deferral of some remuneration for up 10 years.</p> <p>This recommendation was accepted by the Government, Opposition, and both main regulators. The regulators will consult on its implementation later in the year - Mr Jenkins\u2019 reservation about deferral for longer than three years can be addressed then. </p> <p>It is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year\u2019s bonus round.

Rising backlogs and upbeat business confidence should support continued strength in business investment, which are shown to be performing particularly well in the latest national accounts.<br></p> <p>The strength of business sentiment is also being reflected in employment growth, which increased at a record pace in February.

This extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that Bank of England staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information. However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes.</p> <p>The Bank of England does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever.

Nevertheless, Eurozone GDP still contracted 0.4% overall in 2013...</p> <p>While consumer spending was lacklustre across the Eurozone in the fourth quarter of 2013, a 1.6% month-on-month jump in retail sales in January after a drop of 1.3% in December raises hopes that Eurozone consumers will be more sprightly over the coming months, supported by improved confidence overall, stabilizing employment and very low inflation.

The survey\u2019s headline activity index of 58.2 was essentially unchanged from January\u2019s 58.3 reading. The index therefore remains consistent on the basis of past form with strong quarterly gains in services output of about 1%. Meanwhile, the rise in the future activity index from 74.3 to 74.7 and the increase in the new business index from 58.9 to 59.2 suggest that the sector\u2019s near-term outlook is bright.</p> <p>Taken together with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the services PMI is consistent on the basis of past relationships with quarterly GDP growth of as much as 1.5%. Admittedly, it would be unwise to take this reading at face value, as the surveys proved to be far too upbeat in Q3 and Q4. Nonetheless, with business and consumer confidence strengthening, credit constraints loosening and the squeeze on real pay easing, the UK economy should experience another year of robust growth in 2014. Indeed, we still expect GDP to grow by about 3%, which would mark the fastest year of expansion since 2007.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5316f4fde4b093d4729c329f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-05T10:11:43.686Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Standard Chartered cuts bonus pool as profits fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Standard Chartered has cut its bonus pool and warned that business would stay difficult in the first half of 2014 after annual profit fell for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>The London-based bank, which makes almost all its profit in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, cut its 2013 bonus pool 15% to \u00a3772m. </p> <p>The bank, which defied the financial crisis to produce record profits every year, has had a tough time of it recently, especially in Korea, where it has had to write down $1bn of the value of its biggest acquisition.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s shares rose following the announcement after its capital position came in stronger than expected.

      "bodyText": "We had expected Barclays to publish its annual report by now but there\u2019s nothing yet. The blog is pretty much finished for the day but we may post an update when Barclays\u2019 report comes out. Otherwise, there will be a story online promptly with the important details. Lloyds Banking Group plans to pay chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio a fixed payment of about \u00a3900,000 to get round the EU\u2019s bonus cap, the bank said in its annual report. Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 whose total pay in 2013 was \u00a37.5m \u2013 is receiving the shares on top of his \u00a31.1m a year salary to ensure he does not suffer a fall in his earnings as a result of the cap. Jill Treanor\u2019s story about Lloyd\u2019 pay is here. Lloyds said it would seek shareholder approval to pay key staff bonuses worth 200 percent of their fixed pay. Under the EU rule, banks can only pay a bonus of up to one times salary unless shareholders authorise that to be doubled. Jill Treanor tweets that UK Financial Investments, which manages the government\u2019s 33% Lloyds stake, won\u2019t say whether it will support the bonus plans: Lloyds Banking Group has published its annual report, which of course contains details about pay. There are questions over what the banks paid last year and what they intend to do this year now that the EU bonus cap is in force. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting Lloyds\u2019 highlights: Bank bonuses are likely to dominate the rest of the day\u2019s business news when Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group publish their annual reports. Just to recap, Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has already said today that the bank increased bonuses for investment bankers to stop a potential \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of departures in the US. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has hit back at Jenkins over his criticism of proposals for longer-term bonuses. Standard Chartered cut its bonus pool for last year by 15% to \u00a3772m. Lloyds has just published its annual report. More to come. After the Bank of England suspended an official, Mark Taylor, the dean at Warwick Business School, has suggested an apparently simple way to prevent rigging of the currency market. Taylor, a former Bank of England and IMF economist and foreign exchange trader, said. One solution would be to take away the temptation to do this by taking the London 4pm fix average over an hour - so 30 minutes either side of 4pm rather than 30 seconds. It\u2019s a simple, workable solution because it would be a lot harder, if not impossible, to move a market as big as the FX market for an hour. Removing the incentive is much better than regulation because of the global, decentralised nature of the foreign exchange market. There\u2019s more detail on the Bank of England\u2019s investigation of claims that officials condoned information sharing in the foreign currency markets. Apart from the suspension of an unidentified Bank employee, the main news is that the Bank\u2019s court (equivalent to its board of directors) has ordered an extension of the investigation. City law firm Travers Smith has helped the Bank\u2019s own lawyers with the investigation so far. The firm will now carry out a further inquiry for the court and the Bank will publish its report. The Bank didn\u2019t give any hint when the investigation might finish. You can read Jill Treanor\u2019s story here. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, doesn\u2019t appear impressed by Antony Jenkins\u2019 comments about bonuses. Barclays boss Jenkins said Barclays increased bonuses in 2013 despite a fall in profits to prevent a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of departures at its US investment bank. He also criticised proposals that some bonuses should be deferred for 10 years. The idea was put forward by the parliamentary banking commission, chaired by Tyrie. Here\u2019s Tyrie\u2019s rejoinder: The payment of a bonus should be contingent on performance. It should not be a guaranteed part of remuneration. In some cases, performance is evident early on, in others it is not. Risks to banks, the financial system or customers from certain decisions may not become clear for some years. The Banking Commission recommended that in these cases the rewards should be much more closely aligned to the maturity of the risk, with deferral of some remuneration for up 10 years. This recommendation was accepted by the Government, Opposition, and both main regulators. The regulators will consult on its implementation later in the year - Mr Jenkins\u2019 reservation about deferral for longer than three years can be addressed then. It is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year\u2019s bonus round. The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed. It will now be up to regulators to do the job. London has held on to its crown - if that\u2019s the word - as the favourite city of the global super-rich, according to a report by estate agents Knight Frank. The full story by my colleague Julia Kollewe is here. London vies with New York as the top city for the wealthy to buy property but both will be eclipsed by Asian cities in the coming decades. Here\u2019s Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank: History, location and their long-established wealth mean that London and New York\u2019s positions look unassailable, at least for now. It is further down our leader board that the real city wars are being waged. The main battleground is Asia, where a handful of locations are slugging it out in the hope of establishing a clear lead as the region\u2019s alpha urban hub. The European Union has said it will provide \u20ac11bn of aid to Ukraine over the next two years, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has announced. The loans and grants would be delivered in coordination with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. The packaged depends partly on Ukraine signing a deal with the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThe package combined could bring an overall support of at least \u20ac11bn over the next couple of years, from the EU budget and EU-based international financial institutions,\u201d Barroso said, according to Reuters. The EU also intends to bring forward trade benefits Ukraine would have received if it had signed an association agreement with the EU last year. It will also work on providing energy to Ukraine through \u201creverse flows\u201d of gas from the EU. More reaction to the UK PMI survey. Here\u2019s Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club: Today\u2019s PMI services survey provides further evidence that the UK recovery is still going strong. Although headline business activity index ticked down a touch on its level in January, it still remains well above the historical average. Taking February\u2019s three activity surveys together, we appear set for another quarter of GDP growth at around 0.7% in Q1 2014, which keeps us on track for growth in the region of 2.7% over the year as a whole. The finer details of the services survey provide further good news, supporting the notion of a broader economic recovery. Rising backlogs and upbeat business confidence should support continued strength in business investment, which are shown to be performing particularly well in the latest national accounts. The strength of business sentiment is also being reflected in employment growth, which increased at a record pace in February. This is likely to translate into stronger wage growth, as companies begin to face skills shortages, fostering sustained strength in consumer spending. The Bank of England says its inquiry into allegations that senior staff colluded with currency traders has found no evidence to support the claims. However, the Bank has suspended an employee while it investigates whether the person complied fully with internal controls. The Bank\u2019s oversight committee has also appointed City law firm Travers Smith to prepare a report into whether officials colluded or knew about collusion in the currency markets. Travers Smith has been supporting the Bank\u2019s internal review till now. Here is the Bank\u2019s statement: It is a matter of public record that the Bank of England has been conducting an internal review into allegations that Bank of England officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the foreign exchange market or the sharing of confidential client information. This extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that Bank of England staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information. However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes. The Bank of England does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever. The Bank has today re-iterated its guidance to staff regarding management of records and escalation of important information. Those policies have been updated in recent months. In addition, the Oversight Committee of the Bank\u2019s Court of Directors will lead an investigation to assess whether Bank officials were: (a) either (i) involved in attempted or actual manipulation of the foreign exchange market (including the WMR FX benchmark), or (ii) aware of attempted or actual manipulation of the foreign exchange market , or (iii) aware of the potential for such manipulation or (iv) colluded with market participants in relation to any such manipulation or aware of any such collusion between participants; (b) either (i) involved in the sharing of confidential client information or (ii) aware of the sharing of such information between participants for the purposes of transacting business in the foreign exchange market; or (c) involved in, or aware of, any other unlawful or improper behaviour or practices in the foreign exchange market. The Oversight Committee has appointed external legal counsel, Travers Smith LLP, to prepare a report. That report will be published in due course. Travers Smith has hitherto been supporting the Bank in its internal review. All releases are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/default.aspx No decision has been taken on disciplinary action against any member of Bank staff. The Bank continues to support the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into the foreign exchange market. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Bank to make any further comment on this matter. CNN, citing state media, tweets that Russia plans to confiscate assets of US and EU companies if sanctions are imposed over Ukraine.

Furthermore, it marked a third successive quarter of expansion following six quarters of contraction through to the first quarter of 2013. It also meant that Eurozone GDP was up 0.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the first annual growth since the fourth quarter of 2011. Nevertheless, Eurozone GDP still contracted 0.4% overall in 2013... While consumer spending was lacklustre across the Eurozone in the fourth quarter of 2013, a 1.6% month-on-month jump in retail sales in January after a drop of 1.3% in December raises hopes that Eurozone consumers will be more sprightly over the coming months, supported by improved confidence overall, stabilizing employment and very low inflation. Even so, unemployment across the Eurozone is still very high while purchasing power is limited by generally low wage growth, so any pick-up in consumer spending looks likely to be gradual. Here\u2019s some reaction to the UK\u2019s strong services sector figures from Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics: February\u2019s UK CIPS/Markit services survey suggests that the economic recovery still has considerable momentum. The survey\u2019s headline activity index of 58.2 was essentially unchanged from January\u2019s 58.3 reading. The index therefore remains consistent on the basis of past form with strong quarterly gains in services output of about 1%. Meanwhile, the rise in the future activity index from 74.3 to 74.7 and the increase in the new business index from 58.9 to 59.2 suggest that the sector\u2019s near-term outlook is bright. Taken together with the manufacturing and construction surveys, the services PMI is consistent on the basis of past relationships with quarterly GDP growth of as much as 1.5%. Admittedly, it would be unwise to take this reading at face value, as the surveys proved to be far too upbeat in Q3 and Q4. Nonetheless, with business and consumer confidence strengthening, credit constraints loosening and the squeeze on real pay easing, the UK economy should experience another year of robust growth in 2014. Indeed, we still expect GDP to grow by about 3%, which would mark the fastest year of expansion since 2007. Standard Chartered has cut its bonus pool and warned that business would stay difficult in the first half of 2014 after annual profit fell for the first time in a decade. The London-based bank, which makes almost all its profit in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, cut its 2013 bonus pool 15% to \u00a3772m. The bank, which defied the financial crisis to produce record profits every year, has had a tough time of it recently, especially in Korea, where it has had to write down $1bn of the value of its biggest acquisition. The bank\u2019s shares rose following the announcement after its capital position came in stronger than expected. Some analysts have warned that lower profits could leave the bank short of capital. Here\u2019s chief executive Peter Sands from the results statement: 2013 was not a great year for Standard Chartered, and 2014 will inevitably have its own challenges, but we are very clear on what we have to do. We are making changes to adapt to the new realities. We have a strong balance sheet, great client relationships and superb capabilities. Our outlook for 2014 is one of modest growth. Market and trading conditions are more volatile and difficult than a year ago. While current performance momentum is ahead of the second half of last year, performance in the first half of 2014 will remain challenged both at an income and profit level. And here\u2019s some more detail, courtesy of Reuters: The bank said its pretax profit was $7 billion in 2013, down 7 percent from the year before. It had warned in December profits would fall due to losses in Korea, weak investmentbanking income and a slowdown in Asia\u2019s economic growth. The bank\u2019s shares were up 3.3 percent in early trade, having tumbled 28 percent in the last year, compared with a 19 percent rally by European banks as a whole. The stock had fallen earlier this week to not far from its lowest point for the year so far. Sands said the bank was targeting double-digit earnings growth as a \u201clonger-term aspiration\u201d, given slower income growth generally and pressure in Korea market, where higher loans losses have prompted the bank to shrink its business, putting some units up for sale and axing hundreds of jobs. The bank is selling businesses and emphasising cost control and Sands confirmed the bank was seeking buyers for a Hong Kong consumer finance business. The bank is also selling a consumer finance business in Korea. Sands reorganised the bank\u2019s structure in January and on Wednesday identified private banking, trade finance and banking services for mid-sized corporates as three areas of focus. The bank plans to more than double its assets under management by 2020 to $300 billion. Business activity in UK services dipped slightly last month but a survey showed the sector still powering ahead. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index was 58.2, down from January\u2019s 58.3 but orders rose more quickly and optimism about the coming year hit its highest for four and a half years. Job growth increased to its fastest rate since at least January 1998. Markit economist Chris Williamson said the survey suggested the economy would grow at its fastest this year since 2007. Here\u2019s Reuters early story: British companies hired staff at the fastest pace in at least 16 years last month, according to a business survey on Wednesday that showed strong economic growth has carried over into the first quarter. Although Markit/CIPS\u2019 services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) slipped in February to 58.2, its lowest level since June, from 58.3 in January, it still showed robust growth at firms ranging from banks to hairdressers despite bad weather. Readings above 50 signify growth, which has been the case for 14 straight months now. Orders in the economy\u2019s dominant sector grew more quickly and optimism about the coming year rose to its highest in 4-1/2 years. The composite index combining PMIs for manufacturing and construction, released earlier this week, plus the services sector edged down to 58.6 in February from January\u2019s 59.1. But a composite subindex showed the fastest rate of jobs growth since at least January 1998, when the data series first began. Overall, survey compiler Markit said the data pointed to economic growth of around 0.7 percent from January through March - the same as in the final three months of last year. \u201cThere\u2019s no end in sight to the good news,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Businesses in the eurozone had their fastest growth for more than two and a half years, the Markit composite purchasing managers index showed. The growth was led by the region\u2019s services sector, which expanded quicker than originally thought. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 early story: Euro zone private businesses enjoyed their fastest growth rate in over 2-1/2 years last month as the region\u2019s service industry expanded quicker than initially thought, surveys showed on Wednesday. The upturn in the 18-member bloc\u2019s fortunes was again led by Germany, but the gulf between growth in Europe\u2019s biggest economy and the decline in France has only been wider once in the 16-year history of the surveys. Markit\u2019s final Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which gauges business activity across thousands of companies and is seen as a good guide to economic health, was revised up to 53.3 from an initial flash reading of 52.7. That was the eighth month the index has been above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and beat January\u2019s 52.9. The surveys suggest the region\u2019s economy was on course to grow 0.4-0.5 percent in the first quarter, Markit said, more than the 0.3 percent growth predicted in a Reuters poll last month and would be the fastest expansion in three years. \u201cThe final PMI indicates that the euro zone economy grew at the fastest rate since June 2011, contrasting with the slowdown signalled by the flash reading,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit. \u201cHowever, regional divergences remain a concern,\u201d he added. Germany\u2019s composite PMI soared to a 33-month high but France\u2019s fell further below the break-even mark where it has languished for most of the past two years. Italy and Spain, the third and fourth biggest economies in the bloc, both had robust growth. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s tweet on the composite index: And on services: As the MPC starts its meeting, some papers are running stories on the effects of five years of record low interest rates on different groups. The Times reports (\u00a3) that near-zero rates have cost savers \u00a3117bn. That\u2019s the figure from the Save Our Savers campaign, which calculates that if rates had stayed at precrisis levels of 5.25% savings would be worth the equivalent of \u00a34,500 more for every household. The alternative view, made strongly by the Bank of England, is that if rates hadn\u2019t come down sharply the economy would have been completely wrecked, devastating savers and borrowers alike. City AM, published for free in London, reports that in the last five years more than a million homes were bought by first-time buyers who have only known low interest rates. The paper says these homeowners may not have prepared for rate rises when they finally happen. With services surveys coming out in the EU and UK, here\u2019s a quick catchup on the services data from China overnight. Here\u2019s what Reuters reported: Activity in China\u2019s services industry ticked up in February from a 2-1/2-year low the previous month, a private survey showed on Wednesday, confirming other data showing a pick-up in services even as manufacturing activity slows. The HSBC/Markit Services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 51.0 in February from January\u2019s 50.7, buoyed by new orders, remaining above the 50 line that separates expansion from contraction. The rise tallied with the official non-manufacturing PMI, released earlier in the week, which showed activity at a three-month high, and contrasted with two surveys that showed manufacturing activity slowed in the month. \u201cFebruary data signalled stronger expansions of business activity and new work at Chinese service-sector firms,\u201d HSBC/Markit said in a statement. \u201cThat said, the rates of growth remained subdued in the context of historical data.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of banking news expected today. Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group are set to publish their annual reports and Standard Chartered has announced its full-year results. Attention will inevitably turn to pay. Barclays and Lloyds are expected to reveal they are handing their bosses Antony Jenkins and Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio new share awards, on top of their salaries, to prevent their overall pay falling as a result of the EU\u2019s bonus cap. As we report today, one of the architects of the cap has called on the European Commission to sue the UK for ignoring the cap and allowing \u201cabsurd remuneration packages\u201d. In today\u2019s Telegraph, Barclays\u2019 Jenkins says the bank increased bonuses despite falling profits to prevent a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d as bankers quit Barclays in the US. The paper says the annual report will show the number of staff paid more than \u00a31m rose from 428 to between 475 and 500. Here\u2019s my colleague Jill Treanor\u2019s story on the subject. The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee starts its two-day meeting today - which is the fifth anniversary of record low interest rates. Governor Mark Carney is facing down market pressure to start increasing rates, arguing that the economic recovery is not yet firmly entrenched. Booming business and housing survey data have fuelled calls for a rate rise. Figures overnight showing prices in shops falling at their fastest pace for at least seven years could make Carney\u2019s position slightly easier. The purchasing managers index for services, which make up more than three-quarters of UK GDP, comes out at 9:30am. My colleague Nick Mead has come up with lots of charts to show who has won and lost in the time since rates were slashed to 0.5%. Below is a chart showing interest rates for personal loans and mortgages. For all the charts, click here. It\u2019s monetary policy week for the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. Both central banks announce their decisions on interest rates tomorrow facing different pressures. The ECB is struggling to revive the eurozone economy with unemployment stuck at 12% and persistent fears that below-target inflation could lead to deflation. So today\u2019s services PMI survey for the European Union will be closely watched ahead of the ECB\u2019s announcement tomorrow. Reuters reports that the ECB is already primed to loosen monetary policy: The European Central Bank is poised to take action to loosen lending conditions and drag inflation out of a \u201cdanger zone\u201d that threatens to stagnate the euro zone\u2018s fragile recovery. Inflation is running at 0.8 percent, far below the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2 percent, and banks\u2019 early repayment of bumper loans they took from the central bank is draining funds from the financial system - effectively tightening policy. Reversing this by ending operations to soak up money spent on Greek and other countries\u2019 bonds at the height of the euro debt crisis is the prime option for ECB policymakers at Thursday\u2019s meeting. An ECB source predicted there would be unanimous agreement to end so-called sterilisation of the bond purchases under the bank\u2019s Securities Markets Programme (SMP). The resultant release of around 175 billion euros ($242 billion) would roughly double the amount of excess liquidity in the euro zone financial system, help bring down interbank lending rates and could also lower the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar, the source told Reuters. Good morning. After two days of gyrations caused by the Ukraine crisis, markets are expected to respond more to the regular flow of economic and company news. It\u2019s a big day for business surveys with purchasing managers\u2019 indexes for services published for the EU, Germany and the UK. The closely watched reports come as Eurozone and UK ratesetters prepare to announce monetary policy tomorrow.",

Last summer Threadneedle Street was expecting rates to stay on hold until 2016 \u2013 but in the past six months the most likely date of a rate hike has come forward to the first half of 2015. The charts below explore who has won and who has lost over the past five years \u2013 and the factors the MPC will consider as it decides when to raise rates. As this chart based on data from the Bank of England shows, average interest rates on fixed mortgages and personal loans have been at historic lows. But the situation has been nothing to celebrate for pensioners and savers. Pensions expert Ros Altmann calculates that someone with a \u00a3100,000 standard variable rate mortgage has been \u00a33,290 a year better off since the rate cut, while someone with \u00a3100,000 in a cash ISA has been \u00a34,260 a year worse off. The chart above shows savings rates on instant access accounts, fixed rate bonds and cash ISAs languishing at rock bottom. Last August Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that he would not consider raising rates until the unemployment rate (then at 7.8%), fell below 7%. At that time the Bank was not expecting the jobless rate to fall to the threshold until early 2016. But as the chart above shows, the unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected \u2013 to 7.1% in the three months to November before rising to 7.2% in the latest data, the three months to December. Carney revised forward guidance as he presented his inflation report last month. A lack of inflationary pressure, spare capacity, and \"headwinds\" at home and abroad, meant that the base rate \"may need to remain at low levels for some time to come\", the report said. As the next chart shows, the services sector has now surpassed its pre-recession peak by 1.3% \u2013 but GDP as a whole has not yet caught up with where it was in the first quarter of 2008. The production sector remains 12.3% below peak, with manufacturing still down 8.8% and construction off 11.3%. As the chart above shows, inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has recently fallen below the Bank's 2% target for the first time in years. But there are increasing concerns about a bubble in the housing market. In the chart above Nationwide figures show the average price of a home in Britain rose for the 14th consecutive month in February to \u00a3177,846 \u2013 the highest since April 2008. A regional breakdown of the Nationwide figures (below) shows much of the increase is down to price rises in London and the south-east. But a survey this week by property researchers Hometrack found prices were up in more than half the country for the first time in 10 years.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s nice to get some positive economic data, and the GDP figures showing 0.8% growth in the December 2013 quarter were well above expectations, so let\u2019s have a look at the five things you need to know about today\u2019s national accounts figures.</p> <h2>1. Not just real growth but nominal growth is up</h2> <p>Joe Hockey, as all treasurers must do when selling the budget, tried to put on a gloomy face regarding these figures, but there is no doubt they are good for his budget. As I wrote last month, the predictions outlined in December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo), now look overly pessimistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/JYV0X/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Myefo prediction for real GDP growth in 2013-14 was 2.5%. With growth in the first half of this financial year already at 1.4%, GDP would only need to average 0.5% growth in the next two quarters to meet that target. And given that in 10 of the past 11 quarters real GDP growth has been above 0.5% that\u2019s a pretty good bet.</p> <p>But even better for the Treasurer is the nominal GDP figure. This figure is more closely aligned with tax revenue \u2013 because taxes are paid in nominal dollars, not ones adjusted for inflation. In the Myefo, nominal GDP growth for 2014-15 was revised down from the 3.75% outlook contained in the pre-election statement put out by Treasury to a mere 3.5%.</p> <p>Today\u2019s figures show nominal GDP growing annually by 4.4% in trend terms and 4.8% seasonally adjusted. At the current rate, nominal GDP looks good to be at least one percentage point higher than predicted in the Myefo. That will lead to a much better tax revenue \u2013 especially when you consider private corporation profits rose 2.8% in the past 12 months \u2013 the best result since 2011.</p> <h2>2. The mining investment boom is over, but here come the exports.</h2> <p>In my last column I was pretty pessimistic about the end of the mining investment boom. Expected capital expenditure was well down, but as I also noted this also marked the start of the production/export phase of the boom. Today\u2019s figures showed that quite clearly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/fdYMD/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points to growth over the past 12 months.

We\u2019re now beholden to mining exports for growth, not its investment. 3. Mining is still the king But the change in the phases of the boom hasn\u2019t changed mining still being the big driver of our economy. Over the past 12 months mining contributed the most to GDP growth, closely followed by the financial and insurance services industry and the healthcare and social assistance industry. The iron ore mining sector remains the biggest contributor in the industry to GDP growth, with the coal sector\u2019s contribution declining over the past 18 months. The oil and gas extraction sector has for the past six months had a negative impact on GDP growth. Overall the end of the investment mining-boom is reflected in the slight drop off in the contribution of the mining industry to GDP growth. This slight decline is also reflected by, for the first times since the middle of 2012, the industry seeing the biggest annual growth of value added is not mining.

If anyone wants to look for proof of the current IR system dragging down productivity, they\u2019ll have to keep looking. 5. We\u2019re starting to spend again For the seventh quarter in a row the household savings ratio (measuring how much of net disposable income is being saved) declined in trend terms. The savings ratio in trend terms is now below 10% - the first time this has occurred since June 2010. This is reflected by the annual growth of household consumption now at 2.5%, and the quarterly growth has increased for four consecutive quarters \u2013 the first time that has occurred since 2011. Fortunately we have not gone silly such as we were in the early 2000s when our savings ration was actually negative \u2013 meaning we were effectively spending more than we earned \u2013 and when household consumption was growing by up to 6% annually. But this increase does suggest some sort of improvement in consumer confidence. And we will need it, because while consumption by the national government contributed 0.1 percentage point to growth, an austere budget in May might see that reversed.

Popular sights such as Kew gardens, London zoo and Stonehenge all enjoyed a leap in visitor numbers last year. Overall, Britain's main attractions welcomed 6% more people last year than in rainy 2012, with an 8% increase at outdoor destinations. The Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, south-west London, had a 29% rise in visitor numbers, while at London zoo numbers rose 26.4% \u2013 thanks to the opening of the Tiger Territory exhibition \u2013 and Stonehenge was up 18.9%. The figures were published by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), whose members include the UK's most popular and important museums, galleries, palaces, castles, cathedrals, zoos, historic houses, heritage sites, gardens and leisure attractions. The 53 members manage nearly 2,000 tourist sites and have more than 100 million visitors a year \u2013 25% of the annual UK total. Overall, London attractions enjoyed a 12% increase in 2013, with English attractions up 5% and Scottish attractions also up 5%. The British Museum in central London remained the UK's most popular visitor attraction for the seventh year running, with a 20% rise in visitor numbers, to 6.7 million, making it the museum's most successful year on record. It was helped by its sellout exhibition Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Its new Vikings: Life and Legend exhibition opens on 6 March and is expected to be a big seller. In second place, up from third the previous year, was the National Gallery (6.03 million visitors), followed by the Natural History Museum with 5.35 million visitors. The Natural History Museum's director, Dr Michael Dixon, said: \"Last year was another record-breaking one for the Natural History Museum. I believe this reflects the enduring appeal of museums, and our events and exhibitions showcasing our unparalleled collections and research. It also shows the continued success of the free admission policy and the public's real interest in science and environmental issues.\" Only 18 of the Alva venues experienced annual decreases in numbers of more than 10% last year. In 2012, by contrast, 33 locations had a double-digit decline from 2011. Other attractions with big increases last year included the Tower of London (up 18.4% to 2.89 million), the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, south-east London (up 27% to 1.43 million) and Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, where the opening of the Mary Rose Museum resulted in a 55% rise in visitors to more than 674,000. Alva's director, Bernard Donoghue, said: \"2014 is sure to be a momentous year, the 450th anniversary of the birth of Shakespeare. We are delighted that Shakespeare's Globe in London and the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, along with the South Bank Centre in London, are Alva's newest members. In 2013, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust saw a 13% increase in visitor numbers, and they will build on this in 2014 by launching a brand new exhibition, Famous Beyond Words, later this month.\" He said further key anniversaries this year would generate huge interest : \"The 100th anniversary of world war one will be commemorated with the re-opening of IWM London, part of Imperial War Museums, in July 2014 and The Great War in Portraits exhibition just opened at the National Portrait Gallery. The recently refurbished Tate Britain will no doubt see strong visitor numbers too.\" Tourism minister Helen Grant said: \"It is fantastic news for the tourism sector that our top attractions received a boost in visitor numbers in 2013 and the government will continue to support the industry and promote Britain to the world as a great place to visit and do business with.\"",
