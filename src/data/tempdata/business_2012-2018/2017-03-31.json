      "bodyText": "More signs of growing activity from US oil companies, with drills added for the eleventh week in a row. The Baker Hughes rig count showed 15 rigs were added last week, taking the total to 824, which is 374 higher than this time last year. This marks the best quarter for rigs being added since the second quarter of 2011. In all ten oil rigs and five gas were added last week. Brent crude is virtually unchanged on the news, down 0.65 at $52.65 a barrel. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: It\u2019s not been a particularly good quarter for oil prices despite the agreed production quotas for OPEC, and it\u2019s not hard to see why when you look at the rise in the US rig count since the beginning of this year...This return of US shale, and record inventories has taken the edge off any expectation that oil producers will be able to engineer higher prices in the short term. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. It has been a positive quarter for markets but it drifted away somewhat on the final day. The FTSE 100 rose for the fourth quarter in a row, as the drop in the pound following the Brexit vote continued to boost overseas earnings. But a dip in commodity companies as metal prices fell, plus a drop in South African-related stocks such as Old Mutual following the sacking of the country\u2019s finance minister, saw the index slip back on the day. The pound meanwhile managed to edge up slightly between January and March after six quarters of decline, while oil fell around 7% during the period. This marks crude\u2019s worst quarterly performance since late 2015, as investors worried that Opec\u2019s production cuts were being outweighed by growing output from US shale producers. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax recorded its third successive quarter of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average - despite dipping on the day so far - is on course for a sixth successive quarterly gain. The Trump boost to US markets have meant they have held on to most of their recent rises even though doubts about the president\u2019s ability to enact his programme are growing, particularly in the wake of the healthcare defeat. Meanwhile, with the US Federal Reserve , emerging markets are also recovering: the MSCI Emerging Market Index has recorded its best quarter since 2012. The final scores for the day in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.60 points or 0.63% to 7322.92 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.46% to 12,312.87 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.65% at 5122.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.61% to 20,492.94 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 10,462.9 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.65% to 666.06 On Wall Street, the Dow is currently down 25 points or 0.12%. As the quarter drifts to a close, the FTSE 100 is on course for its fourth quarter of straight gains as dollar earners boosted the index in the wake of sterling\u2019s post-Brexit slump. Despite the gains, the quarter is ending on a downbeat note, with the index currently 23 points or 0.3% lower but the decline may not last into the next three months, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Those hoping for more downside in equities once the second quarter gets underway should beware the impact of seasonality. April, far from being the cruellest month for equity markets, is in fact one of the strongest historically, and over the past twenty years it is the strongest. This time could be different, but given an reflationary environment, economic growth and still relatively accommodative central bank policies, does it really make sense to argue with history? Over in Greece, there is more uncertainty after EU officials ruled out negotiations over the country\u2019s latest bailout programme being wrapped up any time soon. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Adding to the intense speculation now swirling around debt- stricken Greece\u2019s ability to conclude fraught bailout talks in the coming weeks, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem dismissed any possibility of the review being concluded at the next eurogroup session on April 7. The Malta meeting of euro area finance ministers had been mooted as the next deadline for the impasse between Greece and its creditors to finally be broken. Speaking after hopes were dashed that the deadlock would be resolved at a Euro Working Group on Thursday evening, the euroroup chairman told reporters: \u201cThe review will not be completed at the next euro group. We hope we can approve it soon but that will not happen on 7 April in Valletta.\u201d If Greece is to realistically conclude talks with creditors in time for massive debt repayments to be paid on 7 July, this needs to be done by May at the latest, insiders say. Any additional delay would reignite fears of a Greek default and unnerve markets. But the differences are manifest and myriad. The leftist-led government, which appears to have given ground on demands for yet more pension cuts and tax increases, is determined not to yield on what it sees as the illogical demands of the IMF for further liberalisation of the labour market. Energy reforms and the spectre of additional job losses have stoked deep disgruntlement in the ranks of the ruling Syriza party amid growing speculation of leftist MPS refusing to endorse the measures - and a government crisis erupting - when they are put to vote just before Easter. European markets are edging higher as we head to the close of trading, but the FTSE 100 is still lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 41 points after a host of US data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was plenty of US data for investors to deal with this afternoon; they just weren\u2019t that interested. The core PCE price index slipped from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month, while personal spending and income fell to 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. The Chicago PMI then rose to a better than forecast 57.7, something that was countered by a worse than estimated drop in consumer sentiment to 96.9. But, as mentioned, none of this mattered to investors, who seemed keen to end the quarter quietly. The Dow Jones trickled 0.2% lower after the bell, taking the index just the wrong side of 20700, but still up from where it was during Monday\u2019s \u2018Trump slump\u2019. Considering how soft the Eurozone\u2019s inflation figures were this morning it is surprising that the region has been so lifeless. Perhaps the euro had time to prepare following yesterday\u2019s weak German CPI reading, meaning the currency merely maintained its month low against the pound rather than seeing its losses widen. The flatness of the euro did nothing for the Eurozone indices, with both the CAC and DAX, the latter admittedly at a 2 year high, shrugging their way through the day. As for the FTSE, the UK index was Friday\u2019s worst performer, dropping 0.4% thanks to a wave of red in its commodity stocks. The pound couldn\u2019t do much with the morning\u2019s decent data, holding on to most of its Thursday growth against the euro while giving back 0.1% to the dollar. The FTSE\u2019s commodity stocks were hit by lower metal prices, while South Africa focused stocks such as investment group Old Mutual and packaging firm Mondi were weaker after the sacking of the country\u2019s finance minister Pravin Gordhan. Following the weaker than expecting US spending figures, it is probably not a surprise that consumer confidence was lower than expected this month. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index came in at 96.9 for March, up from February\u2019s 96.3 but below expectations of a figure of 97.6. And now some stronger than expected US data. The Chicago purchasing managers index for March has come in at 57.7, up from 57.4 in February and better than the forecast figure of 56.9. In line with other global markets, Wall Street has edged lower as investors decided to take some profits on the last day of the quarter. The first three months of the year have seen the strongest January to March performance in four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 31 points or 0.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened down a similar amount percentage-wise. Still with the US, and new data shows that consumer spending was virtually flat in February, and lower that forecasts. According to the Commerce Department, consumer spending rose just 0.1% last month following a 0.2% gain in January. The February increase was the lowest since August 2016 and fell short of expectations of a 0.2% gain. Analysts said part of the reason for the meagre increase was that the government delayed issuing income tax refunds this year in an effort to combat fraud. The personal consumer expenditures price index excluding food and energy - the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure - rose 0.2% in February month on month and 1.8% on an annual basis. This is below the Fed\u2019s target of 2% but the central bank is still on track for further interest rate rises this year. If you\u2019re looking for some lunchtime reading, check out this piece on Bloomberg on how financial workers in New York (and beyond, one imagines) are using WhatsApp to avoid compliance checks and share information. Wall Street\u2019s New Favorite Way to Swap Secrets Is Against the Rules Here\u2019s a flavour: How encrypted messaging is used varies widely on Wall Street. At the big banks, employees will often use such apps to share gossip, tell clients during morning sales meetings what they\u2019re looking to buy and sell (often within sight of their bosses) or even boast about a particularly profitable trade, the people said. A \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d mindset prevails. After betting big on Brexit, junk-bond traders at one of Wall Street\u2019s largest banks crowed about plans for a blowout celebration in a large WhatsApp chat group that included friends from rival firms.... More here: For those of you who want to dig into the details, here\u2019s some links to today\u2019s data: For the current account deficit: Balance of Payments: Oct to Dec and annual 2016 For the fall in the savings rate: Quarterly sector accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 For the fall in Service sector output in January: UK index of services: Jan 2017 For the latest growth figures: Quarterly National Accounts: Oct to Dec 2016 Here\u2019s our news story on the fall in the savings ratio, and what it means for the UK economy: Meanwhile in the eurozone, Mario Draghi might be tempted to enjoy a glass of gavi with his lunch, following the latest inflation data. Inflation in the eurozone tumbled to just 1.5% this month, according to new \u2018flash\u2019 figures, down from 2% in February. That takes the Consumer Prices Index back below the European Central Bank\u2019s target, and means president Draghi might feel less pressure from hawkish colleagues to slow his stimulus programme. However...it may not last. Economists point out that the slowdown is partly because Easter was in March last year, but comes in April in 2017. That means the traditional jump in airline prices, and certain foods, is coming later this year. In another concerning development, the UK service sector suffered a small contraction in January. Services output decreased by 0.1% between December 2016 and January 2017, says the ONS. That\u2019s only the fourth monthly fall since January 2015. It may show that the dominant sector of the UK economy has slowed a little. Monthly data can be volatile, of course, especially straight after Christmas. In the three months to January, service output rose by 0.6% - that\u2019s in line with the average, but does show a slowdown compared to the previous quarter. The ONS blames \u201ca slowdown in the distribution, hotels and restaurants component\u201d. Earlier this week we learned that UK borrowing on credit cards had hit an 11-year high; another sign that people are feeling a financial squeeze. With saving on the slide, and disposable incomes falling, some experts fear that consumers are stoking up serious problems. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is very concerned, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s figures should set alarm bells ringing. The last thing our economy needs right now is another consumer debt crisis. \u201cBut with wage growth stalling and prices rising, many households are having to rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. \u201cPeople raiding their piggy banks and borrowing more than they can afford is what helped drive the last financial crash. \u201cMinisters need to set out a plan for how they will protect living standards as we leave the EU. This must include a more ambitious programme for infrastructure spending to create better-paid jobs across the country. And end the unfair pay restrictions for public sector workers.\u201d Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group has a theory for why Britons are saving less... The Bank of England may be worried by the slump in Britain\u2019s savings ratio to that record low of just 3.5%. As the Indie\u2019s Ben Chu points out, the Bank had predicted it would fall -- but not as sharply as this! The fall in Britain\u2019s current account deficit is partly thanks to the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote. The cheaper pound makes imports pricier and exports more competitive, so it should cushion UK firms from the impact of Britain leaving the EU. Shilen Shah, bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, explains: The uncertainty created by Brexit led to some weakness in business investment during the quarter, however the weakness in Sterling did lead to an improvement in the current account, with the trade component leading the charge.\u201d Dario Perkins of City firm TS Lombard says there are two reasons why Britain\u2019s savings ratio has hit record lows: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned by the fall in Britain\u2019s savings ratio and disposable incomes: Beck says: \u201cThere are worrying signs in the data on the household sector, with a further drop in real incomes meaning that the savings ratio fell to the lowest level on record. Given that this pre-dates the worst of the inflationary pressures, it provides further evidence that 2017 is likely to be a very tough year for the consumer, with little or no scope to offset the headwinds from higher inflation by borrowing more. And given that higher household borrowing was a key part of the MPC\u2019s strong forecast for GDP growth, there must be a good chance that this will not be achieved, strengthening the case for a lengthy period of monetary policy inaction.\u201d Bad news! Britains households are saving less than at any time since record began over 60 years ago, as household disposable incomes slide. The UK saving ratio shrank to 3.3% in the last quarter, today\u2019s report shows, a sharp slide from 5.3% in July-September. That\u2019s the smallest savings ratio since it started being measured in 1963 (Between the end of the \u201cChatterley\u201d ban and the Beatles\u2019 first LP.) The savings ratio is the difference between aggregate spending and income in the household sector, and therefore measures the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income. The ONS also found that disposable incomes fell in the quarter - another sign that households are being squeezed by falling wage growth and rising inflation. The ONS says: The saving ratio fell to 3.3% in Quarter 4 2016, the lowest rate on record. The saving ratio has been declining since Quarter 3 2015 which primarily reflects stronger growth in consumer spending outweighing the rate of growth in household disposable income. Strong growth in consumer spending comes on the back of robust labour market activity, while the slowing in household disposable income growth largely reflects a fall in other investment income from property income. There are also \u2018technical reasons\u2019 for the fall in the savings ratio, including changes to pension funds holdings. But still, it\u2019s a worrying sign: Today\u2019s figures also show how Britain runs a large trade deficit with Europe, and a surplus with the rest of the world. The UK-EU trade deficit came in at \u00a319.5bn in October-December 2016, down from \u00a322.7bn in July-September,. And Britain ran a trade surplus of \u00a37.4bn with the rest of the world, compared with a\u00a33.0bn deficit in Q3. The ONS says: This was due mainly to the movements in erratic items widening the total trade surplus from \u00a32.6 billion in Quarter 3 2016 to a surplus of \u00a313.6 billion in Quarter 4 2016. Good news! Britain\u2019s current account deficit with the rest of the world has shrunk sharply. The UK\u2019s current account deficit was \u00a312.bn in October-December 2016, less than half the \u00a325.7bn racked up in the third quarter of last year. That\u2019s mainly thanks to a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit, the Office for National Statistics says. It means the current account deficit is just 2.4% of GDP, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 2011, and rather better than three months ago Breaking: Britain has cemented its place as the second-fastest growing advanced economy last year. UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the October-December period, the Office for National Statistics reports, unchanged from the earlier reading. That means Britain grew by 1.8% in 2016 - just behind Germany\u2019s 1.9%, but ahead of other G7 members. The ONS report also shows that Service sector grew by 0.8% - matching the earlier estimate Industry grew by 0.4%, up from 0.3%. Construction grew by 1.0%, up from 0.2% Business investment shrank by 0.9%, up from - 1.0% The ONS says: UK GDP growth in Quarter 4 2016 saw a continuation of strong consumer spending and strong output in consumer-focused industries; there has been a slowdown within business investment which fell by 0.9% driven by falls within the other buildings and structures and transport equipment assets, although this is a slightly improved picture from the second estimate of GDP, being revised up by 0.1 percentage points. More to follow.... UK households are still nervous about their financial situation as the Brexit process gets underway, a new report has shown. The Consumer Confidence Index produced by polling firm GfK came in at minus 6 in March, unchanged from February.. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: \u201cConsumers remain cagey about the state of their personal finances and the general economic picture for the UK, especially as wage growth fails to keep pace with the rising costs of living. This chart shows how consumer confidence has been negative since the referendum: Analysts at Barclays think it could weaken further as Brexit played out: We continue to expect overall confidence to soften in the course of this year, in line with weaker activity and slowing real income as inflation peaks just above 3% by mid-year. Confidence with regard to the wider economy could also deteriorate further as consumers begin to register the economic impact of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, now that article 50 has been triggered and that negotiations are set to start. A separate report has found that British business confidence has fallen this month as expectations for economic growth weaken. The latest Business Barometer from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking showed that 48% of companies were more optimistic about the economy, down by 2 points from last month, while 28% were less optimistic, up by 12 points. That created a \u2018net balance\u2019 for economic optimism of just 20%, down by 14 percentage points. The net balance of companies with a positive outlook for their individual prospects dropped 5 percentage points to 35%. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new post-reunification low. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 30,000 in March, to 2.556 million, new figures show. That pulls the jobless rate down from 5.9% to 5.8%. European markets have fallen in early trading, as investors prepare for this morning\u2019s UK growth figures and the eurozone inflation reading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 23 points, or 0.3%, to 7345. South African-focused insurer Old Mutual is the top faller, down 7.5% amid the political crisis triggered by the sacking of finance minister Gordhan overnight. There may also be some profit taking as we approach the end of the first quarter of 2017. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Market weakness may be explained by an element of risk-off into the week-, month- and quarter-end following one of the best starts to the year since 2013. This despite political risk aplenty, the most recent coming from South Africa. Britain\u2019s government has taken another step towards extricating itself from the financial sector, nearly 10 years after the credit crunch struck. The Treasury has sealed a deal to sell \u00a311.8bn worth of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, the building society which was nationalised in the wild days of autumn 2008. The mortgages will be sold to Prudential plc and to funds managed by Blackstone. The proceeds of the sale will allow Bradford &amp; Bingley to repay some of the \u00a315.65bn cost of its rescue. Chancellor Philip Hammond says the deal is \u201cvalue for money\u201d to the taxpayer, adding: \u201cThe sale of these Bradford &amp; Bingley assets for \u00a311.8 billion marks another major milestone in our plan to get taxpayers\u2019 money back following the financial crisis. \u201cWe are determined to return the financial assets we own to the private sector and today\u2019s sale is further proof of the confidence investors have in the UK economy.\u201d But the task isn\u2019t complete yet. Before today, the government held around \u00a316bn of loans made by Bradford &amp; Bingley, and further loan sales are expected before the end of 2018. Is Britain\u2019s housing market catching a spring cold? Prices fell by 0.3% in March, according to the latest data from Nationwide, the first monthly fall since June 2015. On an annual basis (a better measure), growth slowed to just 3.5% - the weakest level since August 2015. With home ownership now at its lowest rate since 1985, this might bring some relief to those trying desperately to grab onto the bottom rung of the housing ladder. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says there is a \u201cmixed picture\u201d across the UK. Six regions saw the pace of house price growth accelerate, six saw a deceleration and one (East Midlands) recorded the same rate as the previous quarter. Interestingly, the spread in the annual rate of change between the weakest and strongest performing regions was at its narrowest since 1978 at 6.8 percentage points \u2013 the second smallest gap on record. \u201cThe South of England continued to see slightly stronger price growth than the North of England, but there was a further narrowing in the differential. Northern Ireland saw a slight pickup in annual house price growth, while conditions remained relatively subdued in Scotland and Wales. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments, shows how the market has slowed since last summer: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two fairly interesting pieces of economic data are coming up this morning. At 9.30am, the third and final estimate of UK growth in the final quarter of 2016 is published. The top line, that Britain grew by a robust 0.7%, probably won\u2019t change. But we\u2019ll also learn how much of a current account deficit was racked up with the rest of the world. Economists are predicting that this deficit shrank, to perhaps \u00a316bn from \u00a325bn in July-September. RBC Capital Markets say: The National Accounts will bring news of the current account deficit for Q4 2016 where the smallest trade deficit since Q2 2011 should be a contributing factor to a narrowing in the overall current account deficit from the 5.2% recorded in Q3. New service sector data for January will also give an early hint on how the UK economy began 2017. Then at 10am, the flash estimate for eurozone inflation this month hits the wires. In February, the cost of living jumped by 2% - unleashing calls for the European Central Bank to stop its money-printing stimulus programme. Those voices may fall quiet today; eurozone inflation is expected to have dropped this month, perhaps to 1.8%, partly thanks to Easter falling later this year. A low inflation reading could trigger some euro-selling, as it would suggest the ECB would maintain ultraloose monetary policy for longer. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Last month we saw CPI hit the ECB\u2019s 2% target for the first time in four years, however this is expected to slip back to 1.8%, while core prices could also slip back from their current 0.9% to 0.8%. Anything weaker than this is likely to pressure the euro further in the short term. So it could be a lively morning.... Also coming up today Building society Nationwide is warning that the UK housing market is slowing, as it publishes its latest house price figures. More on that shortly. Uk telecoms regulator Ofcom is outlining plans to cut broadband prices, by making it easier for rival operators to access BT\u2019s superfast network. South Africa\u2019s markets may be lively, after prime minister Jacob Zuma fired his finance minister, Pravin Gordhan. The rand has already taken it badly, falling 2% in early trading.",

But a dip in commodity companies as metal prices fell, plus a drop in South African-related stocks such as Old Mutual following the sacking of the country\u2019s finance minister, saw the index slip back on the day.</p> <p>The pound meanwhile managed to edge up slightly between January and March after six quarters of decline, while oil fell around 7% during the period. This marks crude\u2019s worst quarterly performance since late 2015, as investors worried that Opec\u2019s production cuts were being outweighed by growing output from US shale producers.</p> <p>Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax recorded its third successive quarter of gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average - despite dipping on the day so far - is on course for a sixth successive quarterly gain. The Trump boost to US markets have meant they have held on to most of their recent rises even though doubts about the president\u2019s ability to enact his programme are growing, particularly in the wake of the healthcare defeat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, with the US Federal Reserve , emerging markets are also recovering: the MSCI Emerging Market Index has recorded its best quarter since 2012.</p> <p>The final scores for the day in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 46.60 points or 0.63% to 7322.92</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.46% to 12,312.87</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.65% at 5122.51</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.61% to 20,492.94</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 10,462.9</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.65% to 666.06</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow is currently down 25 points or 0.12%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58de748ee4b0a411e9aba578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-31T15:27:10.050Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the quarter drifts to a close, the FTSE 100 is on course for its fourth quarter of straight gains as dollar earners boosted the index in the wake of sterling\u2019s post-Brexit slump.</p> <p>Despite the gains, the quarter is ending on a downbeat note, with the index currently 23 points or 0.3% lower but the decline may not last into the next three months, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those hoping for more downside in equities once the second quarter gets underway should beware the impact of seasonality.

The leftist-led government, which appears to have given ground on demands for yet more pension cuts and tax increases, is determined not to yield on what it sees as the illogical demands of the IMF for further liberalisation of the labour market.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was plenty of US data for investors to deal with this afternoon; they just weren\u2019t that interested. The core PCE price index slipped from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month, while personal spending and income fell to 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. The Chicago PMI then rose to a better than forecast 57.7, something that was countered by a worse than estimated drop in consumer sentiment to 96.9. But, as mentioned, none of this mattered to investors, who seemed keen to end the quarter quietly. The Dow Jones trickled 0.2% lower after the bell, taking the index just the wrong side of 20700, but still up from where it was during Monday\u2019s \u2018Trump slump\u2019. </p> <p>Considering how soft the Eurozone\u2019s inflation figures were this morning it is surprising that the region has been so lifeless. Perhaps the euro had time to prepare following yesterday\u2019s weak German CPI reading, meaning the currency merely maintained its month low against the pound rather than seeing its losses widen. The flatness of the euro did nothing for the Eurozone indices, with both the CAC and DAX, the latter admittedly at a 2 year high, shrugging their way through the day. </p> <p>As for the FTSE, the UK index was Friday\u2019s worst performer, dropping 0.4% thanks to a wave of red in its commodity stocks. The pound couldn\u2019t do much with the morning\u2019s decent data, holding on to most of its Thursday growth against the euro while giving back 0.1% to the dollar.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FTSE\u2019s commodity stocks were hit by lower metal prices, while South Africa focused stocks such as investment group Old Mutual and packaging firm Mondi were weaker after the sacking of the country\u2019s finance minister Pravin Gordhan.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58de614de4b01ea2330bdea3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-31T14:04:39.037Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the weaker than expecting US spending figures, it is probably not a surprise that consumer confidence was lower than expected this month.</p> <p>The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index came in at 96.9 for March, up from February\u2019s 96.3 but below expectations of a figure of 97.6.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/847810833321271301\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnitedStates?src=hash\">#UnitedStates</a> Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final at 96.9  <a href=\"https://t.co/gV73G1pzKf\">https://t.co/gV73G1pzKf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6mzDNQHAQ7\">pic.twitter.com/6mzDNQHAQ7</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/847810833321271301\">March 31, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58de5e6ce4b0a411e9aba50f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-31T13:50:31.822Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And now some stronger than expected US data.

As sterling\u2019s fall made UK goods more competitive on overseas markets and boosted exports, there was a significant narrowing in the UK\u2019s current account deficit, the latest ONS growth figures showed. Economists said the rebalancing towards more exports would offset some but not all of the slowdown in consumer spending expected this year as incomes are squeezed. \u201cWhile the drop in the pound is clearly boosting inflation, it is also having some offsetting positive impacts through bringing about a long-awaited rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics. The current account deficit reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. In the fourth quarter of 2016 it more than halved to \u00a312bn from \u00a325.7bn in the third. It equated to 2.4% of GDP, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2011. The ONS said the improvement was mainly due to the sharp narrowing of the trade deficit, or the gap between exports and imports, which in turn was boosted by the fall in the pound since the EU referendum. Before last year\u2019s referendum on EU membership, the Bank of England had highlighted Britain\u2019s record current account gap and noted that the UK relies on foreign investors to fund the shortfall. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, expressed concern that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, foreign investors would become more nervous about buying or holding UK assets. Economists said those fears had not gone away with the latest figures and the pound remained vulnerable to news of another widening in the current account. \u201cThe stock of overseas\u2019 investors assets in the UK equates to a massive 547% of annual GDP. Sterling would depreciate further if only a small proportion of these investors took flight,\u201d said Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cSigns that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit could be a trigger for such a fire sale.\u201d Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Markit, said the narrower deficit was welcome news for the UK economy. He too was cautious about the country\u2019s future trade performance and ability to attract overseas investors but said the current account deficit should be lower over the coming quarters. \u201cSterling\u2019s marked weakening appears to be increasingly feeding through to lift exports, helped by current decent global demand. Additionally, the trade deficit should be limited by softening domestic demand limiting imports,\u201d said Archer.",

    "webTitle": "Ofcom must block Murdoch's Sky takeover, Miliband and Cable say", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take over Sky must be blocked because it would give him too much control of news media in the UK and he is not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner, according to a submission to Ofcom from the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the ex-business secretary Vince Cable. Miliband and Cable, outspoken critics of Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take over Sky, have the support of the Labour peer and barrister Charles Falconer and of Tory father of the house Kenneth Clarke, who have put their name to the submissions. The media regulator is assessing whether the takeover of Sky raises plurality issues and whether under 21st Century Fox\u2019s full ownership \u2013 it currently controls 39% of the pay-TV company \u2013 broadcasting standards would be maintained. Ofcom, which has until 16 May to deliver its decision to the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is also reviewing whether Fox is \u201cfit and proper\u201d to take control of Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. Miliband, Falconer, Clarke and Cable \u2013 who was forced to hand over responsibility for assessing Murdoch\u2019s failed 2010 bid for Sky after telling undercover Daily Telegraph reporters that he was at war with the media mogul \u2013 have filed two lengthy submissions fleshing out their arguments against the deal. An accompanying letter said that while the submission on plurality concerns was \u201ccomprehensive and detailed\u201d \u2013 it runs to 61 pages \u2013 the argument against allowing Murdoch more control of UK news media was succinctly summed up by Lord Justice Leveson in his 2012 report into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. \u201cAll the politicians who gave evidence before the inquiry said that Mr Murdoch exercised immense power and that this was almost palpable in their relations with him,\u201d said Leveson. The letter said this evidence of the \u201cimmense and outsized power\u201d of the Murdochs was central to Ofcom\u2019s public interest test, which states that the media regulator must \u201cprevent any one media owner, or voice, having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d. Fox\u2019s bid to snap up the 61% of Sky it does not already own would give Murdoch control of Sky News and pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. His ownership of UK news media also includes the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun as well as radio group TalkSport, which he controls through a separate company, News Corp. The letter asserted that \u201cthis would give them more control over the viewing and reading habits in our country than any other provider, apart from the BBC\u201d. The 33-page submission raised a catalogue of issues against Murdoch and Fox being fit and proper to take over Sky\u2019s broadcasting licence. \u201cWe believe on the grounds of fitness and propriety, this bid should be blocked,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe fitness test goes to the question of character and conduct. The record is one of persistent disregard for the law and regulatory control.\u201d During its investigation following Murdoch\u2019s previous attempt to take over Sky in 2010, Ofcom found that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence despite the phone-hacking scandal that embroiled the now-defunct News Corporation, then parent of Fox and Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch, then chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky, finding that his conduct had repeatedly fallen short of the standards expected. The political fallout ultimately resulted in Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bid and James Murdoch standing down as chairman of Sky and quitting the UK newspaper business to run Fox, the film and TV operation, from the US. \u201cWe do not believe that Ofcom could be satisfied that Sky would remain a fit and proper licensee if this bid was successful,\u201d said the letter from Miliband, Cable and Falconer. \u201cIndeed, we contend that no reasonable Ofcom properly directing itself on the test it has to apply could come to this conclusion.\u201d Following the failure of the previous bid, Rupert Murdoch spun off the publishing and newspaper assets into a separate company, News Corp, and film and TV into 21st Century Fox, with independent boards, in part a corporate governance measure to facilitate another tilt at Sky. In a letter to Bradley during the 10-day period she has had to review whether to refer the bid to Ofcom, Fox argued that in the six years since the aborted bid, the media landscape had changed beyond recognition. Fox said media plurality was flourishing with the rise of digital rivals such as Google and Facebook and news distributors and new outlets such as Vice, Buzzfeed and Huffington Post, while newspaper sales declined. Fox also argues that splitting the publishing and TV and film operations into two companies solves corporate governance, competition and plurality issues. \u201cWe are confident that a thorough review of our track record over 30 years will underscore our commitment to upholding high broadcast standards, and will demonstrate that the transaction will not result in there being insufficient plurality in the UK,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Fox. Opponents of the bid have raised concerns that Murdoch, who also owns the rightwing Fox News, will use his influence to drive the news agenda, thereby risking the \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News. Fox has also pledged to keep Fox News at arm\u2019s length and \u201ccontinue to broadcast news under the Sky brand maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Tribute bands are all the rage these days. So it should come as no surprise that the triggering of article 50 was marked by a homage to a band that toured the country in the summer of 2016: Project Fear. Project Fear 2017 has been playing its own versions of Beatles hits: I (Don\u2019t) Feel Fine, We (Can\u2019t) Work it Out and, of course, that all-time classic, While My Economy Gently Weeps. It has been quite a trip down memory lane to the days when the band\u2019s lead vocalist, George Osborne, was predicting immediate recession in the event of a Brexit vote. In the event, consumers carried on spending and the economy carried on growing. That\u2019s not to say everything is going to be plain sailing in the two years of negotiations that lie ahead. Nor is it to deny that Britain has some deep structural problems that badly need fixing. But it does mean treating with caution predictions that Britain will end up \u2013 as another 60s icon put it \u2013 on Desolation Row. That was the argument when Britain rightly declined to join the single currency in 2003 and it proved to be spectacularly wrong. It is not inevitable that the UK will suffer damage from Brexit. If the right decisions are made, the economy can flourish. This will be made easier if there is a free trade deal between the UK and the EU 27, but access to the single market is actually less important than making the right calls domestically. The idea that Brexit guarantees economic disaster is based on two assumptions, both questionable. Assumption number one is that Britain is leaving an EU that is doing well. That might have been true when the UK joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, but it is not the case today. Europe has taken longer to recover from the financial crisis than any other part of the developed world; four of its countries have needed emergency bailouts; one of its founder members, Italy, has seen living standards stagnate for two decades. Two European countries at either end of the continent suffered worst from the financial crisis: Iceland, which is not part of the euro, saw its banks go bust but is now booming; Greece has had a bigger and longer slump than that endured by the US in the Great Depression and is still on financial life support. The single currency, which has amplified the impact of the financial crisis for many member countries, is part of the story. But so is a lack of economic dynamism. Consider the companies that have emerged from nowhere to have a big impact since the single market came into being in 1993: Google, Facebook, ebay, Amazon, Uber. The common feature is that they are all American. Many of these companies have emerged from US universities, which fill 17 of the top 25 places in the world rankings compiled by the Times Higher Education. Britain has five slots, the rest of the EU has none. Europe has become more sluggish as economic policy has become centralised. Per capita GDP in the original EU6 states gradually converged on American levels in the first four decades after the second world war, peaking at 80% in the 1980s. It has since fallen to 65% of US levels. Over the past decade the volume of UK exports to the EU has grown by only 4% due to stagnation in many eurozone markets, while exports to the rest of the world have grown by 42%. On current trends, the share of Britain\u2019s trade accounted for by the EU will be 30% by 2030, a level last seen in the early 1960s. The latest balance of payments figures show that Britain runs a deficit with the EU, but a surplus with the rest of the world. The second assumption is that membership of the EU is all that stands between the thriving Britain of today and the low-wage tax haven of tomorrow. Actually, Britain is already a low-wage, low-investment, low-productivity economy that happens to be bolted on to a massive financial centre. It would be fatuous to argue that the EU is somehow responsible for the structural defects of British capitalism, because the dominance of finance over industry and the reluctance to invest in new plant and skills has been a feature of the economy for at least a century. But at the margin, membership of the EU has accentuated those trends. The economic geography of the single market involves an international division of labour so that countries concentrate on what they do best. Germany is best at precision engineering; Britain is best at finance and so has acted as the merchant banker for the rest of the EU. That has made London extremely rich, but widened the gap between the capital and the rest of the country. It is no accident that London was so strongly for remain in the referendum, but its economy has more in common with the crescent of prosperity running through northern Italy, eastern France, the Low Countries and the western L\u00e4nder of Germany than it does with the rest of the UK. Similarly, free movement of labour has allowed employers to meet extra demand by taking on more staff at the minimum wage or just above, rather than by investing. That helps explain why employment is at record levels, but productivity has been feeble. The cry from employers now is that curbs on migration will push up their costs and lead to consumers paying higher prices. Actually, consumers are already paying through the taxes that fund the in-work benefits which subsidise poverty wages. There is an argument that says the UK currently has the best of both worlds: it is inside the single market, yet outside the single currency. Up to a point that\u2019s true, but it ignores the fact that the recovery since the financial crash is built on unsound foundations. The feelgood factor is the result of ingesting large doses of monetary happy pills; ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Mainland Europe is just as addicted to the drugs. In their different ways, both Britain and the eurozone are zombie economies: Britain because the economy runs on worryingly high levels of debt; the eurozone because there is no political appetite for the further integration that might make the single currency work. The big challenge for the UK government is not negotiating a free trade deal to replicate as far as possible the access granted by the single market; it is to remedy long-running defects so that the economy is more competitive and sustainable. Trade does not lead to innovation and investment; rather innovation and investment lead to trade. Does the UK need Brexit to have a modern industrial strategy, to devolve power or boost public investment? In theory, no. In practice, change comes only during periods of upheaval, when it\u2019s clear the status quo is no longer working. Historically, it is crises that force governments, businesses and individuals out of their comfort zone. Brexit is just such a crisis \u2013 for both Britain and the eurozone. It would be a crying shame to let it go to waste. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2017. An earlier version said Iceland \u201cis not \u2026 part of the single market\u201d. To clarify: as a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland does participate in the EU\u2019s single market, with exemptions for agriculture and fisheries policies.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor has triggered the sale of an \u00a311.8bn package of Bradford &amp; Bingley loans bought by the taxpayer at the height of the financial crisis. The loan book will be sold to the insurer Prudential and US private equity firm Blackstone, after what the Treasury described as \u201ca highly competitive sale process\u201d. Philip Hammond said the deal delivered value for money for UK taxpayers. \u201cThe sale of these Bradford &amp; Bingley assets for \u00a311.8bn marks another major milestone in our plan to get taxpayers\u2019 money back following the financial crisis. \u201cWe are determined to return the financial assets we own to the private sector and today\u2019s sale is further proof of the confidence investors have in the UK economy.\u201d The Treasury said it would be the first in a series of sales that will allow Bradford &amp; Bingley to repay its \u00a315.65bn debt to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and corresponding loan from the Treasury. It expects the process to be concluded before the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year. \u201cAny further sales will be subject to market conditions and ensuring value for money,\u201d the Treasury said. Bradford &amp; Bingley was effectively nationalised by the then Labour government in 2008 in a series of bailouts as banks and financial institutions were engulfed by the global financial crisis. Its mortgage book and investment portfolios were transferred to government control, while Spanish bank Santander bought its network of branches and deposits. UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), established in 2010, manages Bradford &amp; Bingley\u2019s loan books on the Treasury\u2019s behalf. The latest deal will leave UKAR with a \u00a322bn balance sheet, down from \u00a337bn in September 2016 and \u00a3116bn in 2010. The Treasury is also pressing ahead with plans to fully offload its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, which now stands at below 3%. When the bank was bailed out in 2008, the taxpayer owned a 43% stake. More than \u00a319.5bn has been returned to the public purse since the original \u00a320.3bn state rescue. While the government is selling off its stake in Lloyds, it retains a 73% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, which it also bailed out during the financial crisis. Hammond said in October that the time was not right to sell its stake in the Edinburgh-based bank.",

      "bodyText": "On every table in the modern concrete atrium, corks were popping as representatives of the main producers in the 300-year-old French champagne industry gathered for their annual London tasting. But the atmosphere was far from celebratory. The biggest brands in the champagne market, from Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon to Bollinger, were gathering on the same day that Theresa May officially triggered the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. As a result, the crisp finish of a Pol Roger or a Veuve Cliquot was tempered by the sour taste of Brexit among the 500-plus attendees at Central Saint Martin\u2019s art school, near the Eurostar terminal in St Pancras. For one importer, Brexit has already made its impact felt through the declining value of sterling, which has suffered double-digit falls against the dollar and euro. Andrew Hawes, managing director of Mentzendorff, which ships Bollinger into the UK, said: \u201cWe are a UK company importing 100% foreign-produced products, so we have borne the full brunt of falling sterling. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to hold off price rises for as long as possible but since January we have had no choice but to increase them. It was inevitable.\u201d Producers and agents are starting to introduce price increases \u2013 typically of between 5% and 10%. The Wine and Spirits Trade Association has already warned that a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of Brexit, inflation and rising alcohol duty will push up the prices of champagne and prosecco in the UK by \u00a31. Even without price rises, appetite for champagne has dimmed. While the UK remains champagne\u2019s number one export market by volume, sales slumped by 8.7% in 2016 to 31.2m bottles. Sales by value were even worse hit, plunging by 14% to \u00a3381m. The Champagne Bureau, which promotes the drink in the UK, blamed the poor performance on sterling. It also singled out a drop in sales of heavily discounted own-label champagne in supermarkets as a reason for the slump in UK sales last year. Consumers previously plumping for bottom-end \u00a310 supermarket champagnes are now drinking cheaper sparkling wines such as prosecco. Total champagne sales fell by 2% globally, to 306m bottles, also hit by a 2.5% decline in France \u2013 still representing around half of the overall market \u2013 the report showed. In value terms, global champagne sales reached \u20ac4.7bn (\u00a34.1bn) last year, just shy of an all-time record. However, UK sales of prestige cuv\u00e9es \u2013 producers\u2019 top champagnes \u2013 have surged by 88% since 2010, while ros\u00e9 champagne sales have risen by a quarter over the same period. At Saint Martins, the event\u2019s tasting area this year included, for the first time, ros\u00e9 and Blanc de Blancs champagne as well as the usual vintage. \u201cUK consumers are no longer seduced by the cut-price propositions but their appetite for premium-priced champagnes is plainly growing with ros\u00e9 and prestige cuv\u00e9es gathering momentum,\u201d said Champagne Bureau director Fran\u00e7oise Peretti. \u201cWe should not be surprised. What we see here is a reinforcement of that special status in the minds of its most loyal customers.\u201d So the champagne industry\u2019s strategy for coping with a referendum vote that punished a perceived metropolitan elite is to give that elite something more expensive to quaff. Typical of the new wave of specialist cuv\u00e9es is Perrier-Jouet\u2019s new Blanc de Blancs \u2013 showcased at the event \u2013 which has just gone on sale in the UK for about \u00a370 and has been chosen by the Ritz as its champagne of the month in April. Thibaut Le Mailloux, spokesman for Comit\u00e9 Champagne which helped to organise the tasting, said: \u201cOver the last 10 years the number of prestige cuv\u00e9es has doubled and there is much to celebrate in this sector. The love affair that the British have for champagne is not going to go away \u2013 it is here forever.\u201d",
