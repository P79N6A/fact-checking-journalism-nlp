    "webTitle": "\u2018Corporate wolves\u2019 will exploit TTIP trade deal, MPs warned", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The controversial TTIP trade deal between Europe and the US could depress workers\u2019 wages by \u00a33,000 a year and allow \u201ccorporate wolves\u201d to sue the government for loss of profit, MPs have heard. The claims were made in a highly-charged House of Commons debate, with many Conservative MPs defending the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership free trade deal and opposition MPs warning that it risks giving too much power to big US corporations. Anti-TTIP campaigners claim one million people have signed a petition against the deal, mainly because of worries that it could open the door to US health companies running parts of the NHS. This has been firmly denied by the UK government and the European commission, who have said public services are explicitly excluded. However, Labour is still worried that the proposals not do enough to protect the public interest. Many MPs have particular concerns about the investor-state dispute settlement clauses, which would give private companies the right to sue the government in international tribunals for loss of profit arising from policy decisions. Labour MP Geraint Davies, who called the debate, urged negotiators to drop controversial clauses, insisting the judicial system in each country was sufficient protection in mature democracies. His motion called for the UK parliament to play a role in scrutinising any eventual deal, instead of it being passed exclusively by Brussels. \u201cThe harsh reality is this deal is being stitched up behind closed doors by negotiators with the influence of big corporations and the dark arts of corporate lawyers - stitching up laws that will be quite outside contract law and common law, outside the shining light of democracy, to in fact give powers to multinationals to sue governments over laws designed to protect their citizens.\u201d \u201cMy view is we should pull the teeth of the corporate wolves scratching at the door of TTIP by scrapping the investor-state dispute settlement rules altogether and so we can get on with the trade agreement without this threat over our shoulder.\u201d Caroline Lucas, the former Green party leader and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said she believed TTIP amounted to a corporate takeover and cited independent research from Tuft University suggesting workers\u2019 wages could suffer by \u00a33,000 a year. \u201cCountries like the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland who are in trade agreements which include this kind of investor-state relationship have been sued 127 times and lost the equivalent money that could have employed 300,000 nurses for a year,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea this isn\u2019t a problem is patently wrong; this is about a corporate takeover and that is why it is right to oppose this particular mechanism.\u201d One Tory MP to object to aspects of the current deal was Zac Goldsmith, the member for Richmond Park, who said TTIP would lead to reduced food standards because of lower US levels. \u201cFree trade agreements are normally about reducing tariffs to trade, taxes and so on on imports and exports. There are some but there are very few between us and the States so the focus will be on standards,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many respects, it is hard to imagine harmonisation of standards between the EU and the US resulting in better standards for us. \u201cTake food \u2026 our standards are I think undeniably higher than the standards applied in the US on a whole range of issues - hormones in beef and pork, the use of steroids, chlorine treated chicken meat, clear labelling of food processes \u2013 we have a fundamentally different approach. We are told by our government that the food standards are safe, nothing is going to happen, but try telling that to US agro-business giants who have been engaging in an orgy of lobbying and who have very high expectations. \u201cI ask members of my own party, why is not OK to hand the reins of our ancient democracy to an unelected EU bureaucracy but it\u2019s absolute fine, it\u2019s great to allow those same unelected Eurocrats to delegate our same democracy to unelected multinational corporations?\u201d The deal was defended by Matthew Hancock, a Conservative business minister, who said concerns about TTIP were scaremongering and misleading. The government claims TTIP could benefit families by \u00a3400 a year through cheaper prices. \u201cTTIP is about fair and free trade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conclusion that trade raises wages and prosperity is one that is borne out not only in the theory and the evidence. That has happened in the decades that I have been on this earth in a greater way than any other time in history.\u201d He said the investor-state dispute settlement clauses were necessary to protect companies investing in areas covered by the deal. Following the debate, Allie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said the debate had been misinformed and was risking the entire deal. \u201cMPs need to engage properly in the discussions around TTIP rather than jumping on the misinformation bandwagon that is currently rolling across Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cIoD members are clear that we need the deal, with nine out of 10 backing it to create jobs and growth. \u201cMany of TTIP\u2019s loudest opponents claim to be in favour of free trade, while hiding their protectionist agenda behind misleading scaremongering about the NHS and investor-state dispute settlement. \u201cTrade unions, meanwhile, have mistakenly tried to paint TTIP as the plaything of multinationals, despite the fact that small- and medium-sized enterprises actually stand to benefit the most. Politicians who are close to trade unions have a particular duty to stand up and make the case for increasing exports and boosting inward investment.\u201d",

      "standfirst": "<p>At North American International Auto Show, America\u2019s affair with gas-guzzling giants took another blow: even the pickups were eco-friendly</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Two of the big themes at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week were pickup trucks and environmentally friendly cars.</p> <p>More surprisingly, automakers are trying to combine them. <br></p> <p>Those two concepts \u2013 size and fuel efficiency \u2013 have rarely been compatible in the past, but 2015 may be the year they finally reach a d\u00e9tente. The irony is that it\u2019s also the year that oil is at $45 a barrel, making gas unusually cheap and lessening demand for electric vehicles. Detroit, as has often been the case lately, may be late to the party. <br></p> <p>The new alliance between big cars and fuel efficiency was apparent in a surprising twist from Hyundai. The automaker followed its eco-vehicle presentation with the unveiling of something unusual: a vehicle that blurs the line between car and truck. The Santa Cruz <a href=\"http://www.hyundainews.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/42741/hyundai-introduces-convention-shattering-santa-cruz-crossover-truck-concept-at-detroit-international\">\u201ccrossover truck\u201d</a> concept is aimed at a customer group Hyundai calls \u201curban adventurers\u201d. The front looks like a car, with two doors and seating for five, but it has a small, extendable pickup bed out back. <br></p> <p>Dave Zuchowski, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said at a press conference Monday that the car would be as useful to outdoor sports enthusiasts as it would be to weekend gardeners and schleppers of antique furniture. In short, it appears to be a vehicle for millennials who are just settling into adult life.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt may not be the vehicle the auto industry expects, but it\u2019s the vehicle these customers want and demand,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2493ee5173487e946e3ba9c1df941b21150621eb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/15/1421336324326/37f5eb99-d0b0-4df1-8906-f20fe366dd73-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Detroit cars 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detroit\u2019s international auto show sees a preponderance of eco-friendly cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Preston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This hybrid, fuel-efficient mullet of a car \u2013 business in the front, party in the back \u2013 is a bid to court drivers of pickup trucks, which, after years of being relegated to the work-vehicles category, are having a renaissance. </p> <p>Domestic full-size pickup trucks took the top three sales slots in the US, <a href=\"http://%20http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-autosales.html\">according to the Wall Street Journal.</a></p> <p>The Ford F-150, long the bestseller among pickups, is followed in sales by the Chevrolet Silverado and the Ram. <br></p> <p>The three models each outsold everything else on the market, including popular midsize sedans like the Honda Accord and Ford Fusion and crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape.<br></p> <p>Automakers have been playing an aggressive game of one-upmanship for full-size pickup trucks. Ram introduced an acclaimed new model for 2013, General Motors followed suit for the 2014 model year, and Ford introduced a mostly aluminum-bodied F-150 in Detroit last winter for the 2015 model year. This year\u2019s show began with the F-150 claiming the <a href=\"http://northamericancaroftheyear.org\">North American Truck/Utility of the Year award</a>, an honor that was bestowed upon the Silverado last year.<br></p> <p>The growing sales of pickups have led automakers to step up the testosterone in their design and marketing. As pickup trucks have gained in popularity, their looks have become more muscular. Today\u2019s slate of light trucks looks like the mechanical embodiment of steroid-addled athletes, greeting the world with huge chrome grilles and bulging fenders. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"271b71e820a652b8e1c33f58a2ef36d925f191bc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/15/1421336385718/ced3b480-ca3b-4b70-92ba-5cd361e89dd0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Detroit cars 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pikcups abound at the Detroit auto show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Preston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nissan, not to be left out of the act of manly truck-flexing, <a href=\"http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/2016-nissan-titan-xd-makes-world-debut-at-north-american-international-auto-show\">introduced its redesigned Titan XD</a> with a video that crowed: \u201cWhen you see the front of this truck, you know something big is lurking under the hood.\u201d <br></p> <p>The something big under the hood is a turbo-diesel V8, but it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to guess at the innuendo in Nissan\u2019s marketing for the truck.</p> <p>This kind of pitch appeals most to American men, and so automakers are selling \u201cmade in the USA\u201d as a benefit. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan, stressed at a press conference Monday that the Titan XD was designed, engineered and would be built in the United States. He also said that Nissan\u2019s full-size pickup was aimed at potential customers who wanted the power of a heavy-duty pickup at the lower price of a lighter vehicle. <br></p> <p>The midsize pickup trucks had been relatively stale since General Motors introduced its new US-market Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon twins at the Los Angeles auto show in 2013. <br></p> <p>But Toyota jumped into the fray, <a href=\"http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/2015+naias+2016+toyota+tacoma+dominates.htm\">drawing back the cover on an all-new Tacoma for 2016</a>. Toyota eschewed the huge grille displayed on GM\u2019s midsize trucks in favor of a front fascia reminiscent of the Ford Fusion, or an Aston Martin. Toyota also stressed how American its truck is. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe0f717f26a3ce3e3379d825109a45adccbb61f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/15/1421336440968/02164647-cb56-40fe-a492-845de4b89a95-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Detroit cars 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the need for speed?

The automaker <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/01/12/shelby-gt350r-mustang.html\">introduced the Shelby GT350R</a>, a high-performance version of the new Mustang, and the <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/01/12/ford-redefines-innovation-with-gt-supercar.html \">Lamborghini-like </a>GT supercar.<br></p> <p>But first, Ford unveiled an expansion of its F-150 line, the <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/01/12/all-new-f-150-raptor.html\">latest edition </a>of its offroad-tuned Raptor model. There seemed to be a collective sharp intake of breath from several corners of the room when Ford announced that the new high-performance truck would be V6-powered, but the automaker justified the move by calling the truck the \u201csmartest\u201d Raptor ever. Apparently in today\u2019s world, even muscle trucks can be green.<br></p> <p>Among the economy-oriented green vehicles displayed at the show, technology was key. Chevrolet led the green charge Monday morning, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/12/chevy-introduces-new-electric-bolt-200-miles-per-charge\">introducing</a> a new Volt hybrid for 2016 and a surprisingly European-looking battery-electric concept called the Bolt, both of which were the recipients of new battery technology.<br></p> <p>Acura managed to enter the supercar arena at the same time as it waded into the green pool with its new NSX. Like its aluminum-bodied predecessor, which was discontinued after 2005, the new NSX is V6-powered.

      "bodyText": "Two of the big themes at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week were pickup trucks and environmentally friendly cars. More surprisingly, automakers are trying to combine them. Those two concepts \u2013 size and fuel efficiency \u2013 have rarely been compatible in the past, but 2015 may be the year they finally reach a d\u00e9tente. The irony is that it\u2019s also the year that oil is at $45 a barrel, making gas unusually cheap and lessening demand for electric vehicles. Detroit, as has often been the case lately, may be late to the party. The new alliance between big cars and fuel efficiency was apparent in a surprising twist from Hyundai. The automaker followed its eco-vehicle presentation with the unveiling of something unusual: a vehicle that blurs the line between car and truck. The Santa Cruz \u201ccrossover truck\u201d concept is aimed at a customer group Hyundai calls \u201curban adventurers\u201d. The front looks like a car, with two doors and seating for five, but it has a small, extendable pickup bed out back. Dave Zuchowski, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said at a press conference Monday that the car would be as useful to outdoor sports enthusiasts as it would be to weekend gardeners and schleppers of antique furniture. In short, it appears to be a vehicle for millennials who are just settling into adult life. \u201cIt may not be the vehicle the auto industry expects, but it\u2019s the vehicle these customers want and demand,\u201d he said. This hybrid, fuel-efficient mullet of a car \u2013 business in the front, party in the back \u2013 is a bid to court drivers of pickup trucks, which, after years of being relegated to the work-vehicles category, are having a renaissance. Domestic full-size pickup trucks took the top three sales slots in the US, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ford F-150, long the bestseller among pickups, is followed in sales by the Chevrolet Silverado and the Ram. The three models each outsold everything else on the market, including popular midsize sedans like the Honda Accord and Ford Fusion and crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape. Automakers have been playing an aggressive game of one-upmanship for full-size pickup trucks. Ram introduced an acclaimed new model for 2013, General Motors followed suit for the 2014 model year, and Ford introduced a mostly aluminum-bodied F-150 in Detroit last winter for the 2015 model year. This year\u2019s show began with the F-150 claiming the North American Truck/Utility of the Year award, an honor that was bestowed upon the Silverado last year. The growing sales of pickups have led automakers to step up the testosterone in their design and marketing. As pickup trucks have gained in popularity, their looks have become more muscular. Today\u2019s slate of light trucks looks like the mechanical embodiment of steroid-addled athletes, greeting the world with huge chrome grilles and bulging fenders. Nissan, not to be left out of the act of manly truck-flexing, introduced its redesigned Titan XD with a video that crowed: \u201cWhen you see the front of this truck, you know something big is lurking under the hood.\u201d The something big under the hood is a turbo-diesel V8, but it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to guess at the innuendo in Nissan\u2019s marketing for the truck. This kind of pitch appeals most to American men, and so automakers are selling \u201cmade in the USA\u201d as a benefit. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan, stressed at a press conference Monday that the Titan XD was designed, engineered and would be built in the United States. He also said that Nissan\u2019s full-size pickup was aimed at potential customers who wanted the power of a heavy-duty pickup at the lower price of a lighter vehicle. The midsize pickup trucks had been relatively stale since General Motors introduced its new US-market Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon twins at the Los Angeles auto show in 2013. But Toyota jumped into the fray, drawing back the cover on an all-new Tacoma for 2016. Toyota eschewed the huge grille displayed on GM\u2019s midsize trucks in favor of a front fascia reminiscent of the Ford Fusion, or an Aston Martin. Toyota also stressed how American its truck is. There was much talk about green technology in Detroit this week, but only a small amount of it was heard at Ford\u2019s presentation. The automaker introduced the Shelby GT350R, a high-performance version of the new Mustang, and the Lamborghini-like GT supercar. But first, Ford unveiled an expansion of its F-150 line, the latest edition of its offroad-tuned Raptor model. There seemed to be a collective sharp intake of breath from several corners of the room when Ford announced that the new high-performance truck would be V6-powered, but the automaker justified the move by calling the truck the \u201csmartest\u201d Raptor ever. Apparently in today\u2019s world, even muscle trucks can be green. Among the economy-oriented green vehicles displayed at the show, technology was key. Chevrolet led the green charge Monday morning, introducing a new Volt hybrid for 2016 and a surprisingly European-looking battery-electric concept called the Bolt, both of which were the recipients of new battery technology. Acura managed to enter the supercar arena at the same time as it waded into the green pool with its new NSX. Like its aluminum-bodied predecessor, which was discontinued after 2005, the new NSX is V6-powered. But the new car is a hybrid. Built from aluminum, carbon-fiber and other lightweight materials, the NSX is powered by a twin-turbo V6 and three electric motors. Put against the more conventional one motor, one engine hybrid setup \u2013 if there is such a thing \u2013 multiple electric motors has come to define the cutting edge of technology. Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent company, said at a press event Sunday that the automaker planned to have 10 plug-in hybrid models in its lineup by 2017. This week, Mercedes introduced one of them: the C350 plug-in hybrid, which the automaker said could travel up to 20 miles on a fully charged battery. Mercedes has not yet released fuel economy numbers for the car, but said the gasoline engine and electric motor, which combined produce 275 horsepower and 443 lb ft of torque, can launch it from zero to 60 mph in a scant 5.9 seconds, on the way to a top speed of 130 mph. Mercedes also announced an electric version of its Smart Fortwo Flashlight edition, which it said had a range of about 90 miles. Audi unveiled the plug-in hybrid Q7 e-tron Quattro crossover Monday. Again, no word on fuel economy numbers, but acceleration is relatively quick \u2013 the hybrid drivetrain propels the car to 60 mph in 6 seconds, and the top speed is 140 mph. Hyundai said it would begin selling a hybrid model of its Sonata sedan in the spring and a plug-in hybrid version this summer. While the plug-in hybrid\u2019s \u201cnormal mode\u201d fuel economy numbers \u2013 38 miles per gallon for the city and 43 miles per gallon for the highway \u2013 are slightly lower than the plain hybrid\u2019s 39 city, 44 highway, the plug-in model boasts a 22-mile range. In autos, when one model rises, another is sure to fall. This means slow times are ahead for that American stalwart, the midsize sedan.

      "bodyText": "The Swiss owner of Cartier watches saw its share price plunge after announcing that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had hit sales, while a shock decision to end Switzerland\u2019s currency cap against the euro eroded investor confidence. Richemont, which is the world\u2019s second-largest luxury goods firm, owns brands including Purdey shotguns and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels jewellers. It was the biggest faller on the Swiss stock market on a day expected to be the worst for the index since Black Friday in 1987. In early trading, Richemont led the fallers on the Swiss stock market, as SFr127bn (\u00a385bn) was wiped off the value of Swiss companies, following a surprise decision by Switzerland\u2019s central bank to abandon its three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs against the euro. Shares in Richemont tumbled 17%, followed by Swatch, down 14%, and the Julius Baer private banking group, down 12%. The overall Swiss market was down nearly 10%. Watchmakers were hardest hit, because the central bank\u2019s decision to scrap the currency cap will make their goods more expensive in vital foreign markets. Nick Hayek, the boss of Swatch described the decision as \u201ca tsunami\u201d for Switzerland and its export industry. The shock decision came as Richemont revealed that sales in Asia had fallen as a result of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and a crackdown on lavish gift giving in China. Richemont\u2019s sales in Asia Pacific were down 12% to \u20ac1.07bn (\u00a3822m) in the final three months of 2014, as a result of a \u201cdifficult trading environment in most markets, primarily in Hong Kong and Macau\u201d, the company said.

      "bodyText": "Upmarket estate agent Savills has upgraded its annual profit forecast after the government\u2019s overhaul of stamp duty triggered a surge in the sale of expensive homes. The agency now expects 2014 profits to be \u201cwell ahead\u201d of its previous expectations, following a stonking December that also recorded a number of big commercial property deals in the UK and Europe. George Osborne\u2019s surprise announcement in the autumn statement that wealthy homeowners will pay more stamp duty triggered a last-minute frenzy of deals. Wealthy buyers scrambled to complete their purchases before the changes took effect just hours later, at midnight on 3 December. As well as rushing through deals that had already been agreed, Savills conducted one entire transaction from offer to exchange of contracts, that same evening, saving the buyer of a \u00a35m house more than \u00a3160,000 in tax. The chancellor scrapped the previous slab structure, in which stamp duty was paid at a single rate on the entire property price, and increased the levy charged on homes worth between \u00a3925,001 and \u00a31.5m to 10%. The rate hits 12% on the portion above \u00a31,500,000. Those buying an average family home worth \u00a3275,000 are saving \u00a34,500 in tax while those buying an average London home save \u00a34,900, according to HM Treasury. For many estate agents, this meant Christmas came early, as the changes reignited the housing market. Shares in Savills rose more than 5% to 686p on news of the upgrade. City analysts had previously expected the firm to make profits before tax of \u00a389m in 2014. House broker Numis raised its profit estimates for last year to \u00a399m from \u00a390m, and for this year to \u00a3107m from \u00a3105m. It hailed 2014 as a \u201chighly successful year for the group\u201d. Savills remains cautious about the first half of this year, citing uncertainty around the general election in May and the timing of a sustainable recovery in the Hong Kong property market. Bovis Homes became the latest housebuilder to issue an upbeat trading statement, despite recent evidence that the housing market is cooling. It built 30% more homes last year than in 2013, which is expected to result in a \u201cstrong increase\u201d in annual profits.",

      "bodyText": "The oil and gas industry has called for a 50% cut in North Sea taxes and said that up to a 100 fields were in danger of closing because of the plunging oil price. The warning from Malcolm Webb, head of lobby group Oil &amp; Gas UK, came as BP cut 300 jobs in Aberdeen. Before a meeting with Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, who is visiting Aberdeen, Webb said politicians had for too long ignored a problem in the industry that had been evident for years. \u201cSome companies are paying 80% as the highest tax rate on fields in the North Sea. We would like to see 30% as the top tax rate and our industry treated as the same as any other.\u201d \u201cWe now have a situation where one third of UK offshore fields are in negative cash flow, that means approaching 100 fields. \u201cIf we have sub-$50 oil for a couple of years it is inevitable that some will be closed and decommissioned.\u201d The oil price, which had fallen to below $45 earlier in the week, recovered to just above $50 a barrel on Thursday, a gain of more than 3% on the day. Webb said the closure of Britain\u2019s ageing oilfields would endanger more profitable ones because pipeline networks were often connected. BP\u2019s job cuts in Aberdeen, Britain\u2019s oil capital, follow similar moves by Shell and Chevron last year. Trevor Garlick, Regional President for BP North Sea said: \u201cWe are committed to the North Sea and see a long term future for our business here. However, given the well documented challenges of operating in this maturing region and in toughening market conditions, we are taking specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust, and we are aligning with the wider industry.\u201d He added: \u201cWhilst our primary focus will be on improving efficiencies and on simplifying the way we work, an inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 200 onshore staff and 100 contractor roles.\u201d Davey, the latest in a number of politicians to visit Aberdeen recently, said he was determined to address the challenges the North Sea industry faces both in the short and longer term as a matter of priority. \u201cThe threat to jobs has been brought home by the news from BP today. We have great sympathy with all those directly affected. \u201cBP is a significant investor and employer in the North Sea and the UK government recognises the importance of the North Sea sector, both in terms of thousands of Scottish jobs it supports and its overall benefit to the whole UK economy.\u201d But Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of the Unite union, accused politicians of doing too little too late. \u201cPeople are paying with their livelihoods, because of a failure by the oil majors and the Westminster government to prepare for a fall in oil prices. They\u2019ve made hay while the sun shone, but put aside little for a rainy day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Swiss National Bank has abandoned the currency cap with the euro, making a visit to Switzerland yet more expensive. What does it mean for a holiday? The price of a ski pass in Switzerland\u2019s most popular ski resort, Verbier, has just gone from silly to plain insane. At Wednesday\u2019s rate a week-long lift pass for one person would have cost around \u00a3290 in sterling terms. When the Swiss franc soared on Thursday morning the same pass would at one point have been heading towards \u00a3400. Even after currency markets settled down (a bit) it will now set you back around \u00a3320. Throw in boot and ski hire and a family of four could pay more than \u00a31,750 for a week as well as their flights, accommodation and food. Crystal Ski, one of the larger ski operators, said most holidaymakers will already have purchased in advance in sterling, so they would be protected. \u201cThe main impact will be the cost of lunch on the mountain,\u201d said a spokeswoman. Is this the death-knell for the Swiss tourist industry? Possibly. The number of Brits travelling to Switzerland for ski holidays has been tumbling for years, down to just 5.5% of the 867,000 UK holidaymakers who hit the slopes last year. Austria \u2013 which is in the euro \u2013 now attracts five times as many British skiers as Switzerland. Crystal Ski stopped offering chalet holidays in Switzerland this year because sky-high wages for staff made it uneconomic \u2013 it said rates were approaching \u00a330 an hour. Sterling has risen strongly against the euro over the past year, making holidays in France and Austria cheaper. Is it now the most expensive place in the world? No one heads to the mountains or lakes knowing it will be cheap, but prices still have the power to shock. Bananas are four times the price of those in the UK and a burger and fries is typically SFr20 \u2013 now \u00a313.30. The top-rated hotel on TripAdvisor in Geneva is the Four Seasons, and its basic room rate is now \u00a3449 a night. Is Switzerland now only for the royals (and hedge fund managers?) Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson may be rueing their recent purchase of a luxury chalet in Verbier thought to be worth up to \u00a313m. It is understood it was bought with a multimillion-pound mortgage, believed to be at least \u00a38m. If the mortgage is in Swiss francs, then the monthly payments will now soar in sterling terms. Zug, the Swiss canton that plays host to hedge fund managers attracted by its low income tax rate, may now see something of an exodus. Each time the Swiss franc climbs, so does the cost for overseas firms of hiring employees, paying for offices \u2013 and paying mortgages if they are in local currency. Who else does this affect? Apart from Swiss watchmakers and other industries, whose products will now look seriously overpriced on world markets, one of the more unexpected casualties will be homebuyers in Hungary and Poland. Hundreds of thousands foolishly took out mortgages denominated in Swiss francs because at the time it meant super-low interest rates. In effect, a 30% increase in the Swiss franc against, say, the Hungarian forint means that the monthly cost of servicing the loan also goes up 30%. Many were already in arrears before the leap in the Swiss franc (although compensation arrangements have mostly been put in place); if more and more default it could put intense pressure on the local banking system. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2015 to correct some exchange rates",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency dealer World First The Swiss National Bank has thrown in the towel and given up trying to weaken its currency in the face of outright deflation and a falling European single currency. This is a complete capitulation. The pressure and belief that the European Central Bank will launch a bond buying programme in the coming week \u2013 further devaluing its currency \u2013 has been enough to make the Swiss National Bank step out of the way. Nobody wins when you stand in the way of a freight train, except for the train. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com The SNB has close ties with the European Central Bank (ECB). This move could be a sign that the SNB thinks (or knows) that the ECB will embark on QE at next week\u2019s meeting, and the size of its QE programme could be bigger than the market expects \u2013 perhaps $1tn, not the $500bn that was \u201cleaked\u201d last week. If the SNB is so spooked it is disbanding a policy that it has held dear since 2011, then the rest of the market may want to reconsider their expectations for next week\u2019s ECB meeting. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International Central banks around the world are likely to be on alert following the extreme reaction in currency markets to the change in Swiss National Bank policy. The current state of markets may be no less crisis-prone than in pre-2007 times. The threat that international regulators have so far failed to address is that which arises from global investors\u2019 practice nowadays of running mismatched currency positions as between assets and liabilities. The so-called \u201ccarry trade\u201d is one that could yet occasion serious trouble for international markets and the global economy. To meet this threat, though, regulators would have to extend their monitoring of the financial system well beyond the banks. This is, indeed, a direction in which some of them would like to move. In the meantime, central banks will be on the lookout for the incipient signs of distress that might portend more generalised problems. If nothing else, Thursday\u2019s market action serves as a reminder that current conditions are far from the old \u201cnormal\u201d. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at Swissquote Bank The panic situation in the Swiss franc is expected to continue until a new game plan [emerges]. In its official communication, the SNB stated that \u201cdivergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas have increased significantly \u2013 a trend that is likely to become even more pronounced. [\u2026] In these circumstances, [\u2026] reinforcing and maintaining the minimum exchange rate for the Swiss franc against the euro is no longer justified\u201d. But we believe that any intervention from the SNB would be similar to dropping a handful of sand on the beach. The volatilities are expected to continue. Alex Dryden Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management This move wasn\u2019t completely unexpected; it was becoming increasingly painful for the SNB to maintain this support for the Swiss currency cap. That said, the additional interest rate cut is a surprise and it will now mean investors will have to pay around 80 basis points to hold Swiss currency on deposit for three months. The SNB hopes that this will dissuade investors from viewing the Swiss Franc as a safe-haven and therefore avoid a negative shock for the Swiss economy. Jan Dehn, head of research at fund manager Ashmore The prospect of QE from the ECB is now triggering reactions in non-euro countries, such as Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank on Thursday decided to pre-empt ECB QE by cutting interest rates by 0.5% to -0.75%, while at the same time removing the 1.20 euro cap for the exchange rate. Indications are that SNB immediately began to intervene to weaken the CHF. Investors will now effectively be charged 75 basis points for the pleasure of investing in Switzerland. Bear in mind the broader backdrop for this. Currencies are becoming more and more important drivers of global sentiment and the global backdrop therefore remains extremely volatile. In 2014, Japan embarked on a brash new experiment to create inflation and weaken its currency in an attempt to grow at the expense of other countries. Europe is set to follow suit very shortly. Monetary policies in Japan and Europe amount to \u201cbeggar thy neighbour\u201d policies; they are substitutes for proper domestic adjustment and reform. They transfer the cost of adjustment to other countries. It is by no means certain that these policies will work; they do not address any underlying structural problems.",

Investors were also trying to work out what this meant for the much anticipated quantitative easing plans expected to be unveiled by the European Central Bank next week.</p> <p>The falls follow another overnight decline on Wall Street and despite rises in Asia, and wiped out all the early investor optimism.</p> <p>On the positive side, the biggest riser so far is information services group <strong>Experian</strong>, up 34p at \u00a310.99 after it reported flat organic revenues for the third quarter but said it was confident of returning to growth.

After a volatile few minutes trading the FTSE 100 is currently down 60.07 points lower at having earlier climbed as high as 6472, as the euro found its own level against the Swiss franc with a hefty slump. Investors were also trying to work out what this meant for the much anticipated quantitative easing plans expected to be unveiled by the European Central Bank next week. The falls follow another overnight decline on Wall Street and despite rises in Asia, and wiped out all the early investor optimism. On the positive side, the biggest riser so far is information services group Experian, up 34p at \u00a310.99 after it reported flat organic revenues for the third quarter but said it was confident of returning to growth. Oriel Securities said: We value the shares at around \u00a312 using our discounted cashflow model. At the current price the stock is supported by a 6.3% free cashflow yield. We expect clearer articulation of strategy at the capital markets day on 28 January. Liberum said: We remain optimistic that organic growth should pick-up in the final quarter, not least aided by the annualisation of prior year acquisitions, the reducing size of consumer relative to the group as well as a continuation of improved trading conditions in credit services.

The slowing growth in the broader economy, and specifically in the housing sector, suggests that this year the RBA will not sit on its hands, and that its first move will be to cut rates.<br></p> <p>The last time the RBA changed the cash rate was back in August 2013, and the 17 month stretch without a change in interest rates is the second longest. If the rates are kept unchanged next month, it will tie with the 18 months from January 1995 to June 1996, when the RBA sat on its hands.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/IzNN6/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But to give you an idea of how different things are now, back then the cash rate for 19 months remained at 7.5% \u2013 a rate that seems impossibly high.<br></p> <p>Of course the economy has changed somewhat since then.<br></p> <p>In 1994, interest rates at 17% were fresh in people\u2019s minds and inflation remained a major concern. The RBA actually increased the cash rate in December 1994 to 7.5% because of fears of inflation due to the economy growing too fast.<br></p> <p>Throughout 1994 the average standard variable home loan rate of 8.75% was the lowest for 20 years, and it helped lead to the economy growing 5% in that year. Then, prime minister, <a href=\"http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9452\">Paul Keating</a>, suggested the rates were increased \u201cto shave the top off demand so we keep this recovery sustainable\u201d.<br></p> <p>By contrast, the current average variable rate has been at 5.95% for over 12 months. The last time mortgage rates were that low for that long The Beatles had yet to release <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Be\">Let it Be</a>. But rather than needing to \u201cshave\u201d demand, the RBA will cut rates to boost it.<br></p> <p>The big change in the outlook came with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/dec/04/australias-dreadful-gdp-figures-six-things-you-need-to-know\">September GDP figures</a> in early December, which saw the economy grow well below expectations at just 2.7%.<br></p> <p>Prior to these figures, the market suspected interest rates would continue to stay steady for most of this year, with a 50% chance the RBA would cut them by July.<br></p> <p>The week after the GDP figures came out, the likelihood of a rate cut by July rose to 74%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/qHY0v/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By the start of last week, the market was pricing in a 70% chance of a rate cut by April, and predicting that it would definitely happen by June. This week the expectations of rate cuts have increased even further, with the market suggesting an 83% chance of the RBA cutting rates all the way to 2.0% by the end of the year. </p> <p>Now, we shouldn\u2019t assume that just because financial traders believe the RBA will cut rates that it will happen. After all, 12 months ago the market expected that the cash rate by the middle of this year would 3.0%.<br></p> <p>But there does appear to be a fair bit of evidence that the expectation of a cut is more likely to be right than wrong.<br></p> <p>Above all else the main impact of interest rates is on the housing market.

      "bodyText": "In 2014, for the first time since 2004 the RBA did not change interest rates in a calendar year. The slowing growth in the broader economy, and specifically in the housing sector, suggests that this year the RBA will not sit on its hands, and that its first move will be to cut rates. The last time the RBA changed the cash rate was back in August 2013, and the 17 month stretch without a change in interest rates is the second longest. If the rates are kept unchanged next month, it will tie with the 18 months from January 1995 to June 1996, when the RBA sat on its hands. But to give you an idea of how different things are now, back then the cash rate for 19 months remained at 7.5% \u2013 a rate that seems impossibly high. Of course the economy has changed somewhat since then. In 1994, interest rates at 17% were fresh in people\u2019s minds and inflation remained a major concern. The RBA actually increased the cash rate in December 1994 to 7.5% because of fears of inflation due to the economy growing too fast. Throughout 1994 the average standard variable home loan rate of 8.75% was the lowest for 20 years, and it helped lead to the economy growing 5% in that year. Then, prime minister, Paul Keating, suggested the rates were increased \u201cto shave the top off demand so we keep this recovery sustainable\u201d. By contrast, the current average variable rate has been at 5.95% for over 12 months. The last time mortgage rates were that low for that long The Beatles had yet to release Let it Be. But rather than needing to \u201cshave\u201d demand, the RBA will cut rates to boost it. The big change in the outlook came with the September GDP figures in early December, which saw the economy grow well below expectations at just 2.7%. Prior to these figures, the market suspected interest rates would continue to stay steady for most of this year, with a 50% chance the RBA would cut them by July. The week after the GDP figures came out, the likelihood of a rate cut by July rose to 74%: By the start of last week, the market was pricing in a 70% chance of a rate cut by April, and predicting that it would definitely happen by June. This week the expectations of rate cuts have increased even further, with the market suggesting an 83% chance of the RBA cutting rates all the way to 2.0% by the end of the year. Now, we shouldn\u2019t assume that just because financial traders believe the RBA will cut rates that it will happen. After all, 12 months ago the market expected that the cash rate by the middle of this year would 3.0%. But there does appear to be a fair bit of evidence that the expectation of a cut is more likely to be right than wrong. Above all else the main impact of interest rates is on the housing market. Lower interest rates means more people take out loans to buy and build houses and apartments, which means people get employed to build them, who then have money to spend in the shops and thus the growth multiplies throughout the economy. But despite having such low interest rates, last week the monthly building approvals figures showed that for the first time since May 2012, the annual growth of private sector building approvals was negative: And it is a trend that occurs across the nation. Most states \u2013 even those where the annual growth of building approvals remains positive \u2013 have lower growth than 12 months ago. Only Tasmania, coming off a very low base, is experiencing improvement: Mostly the fall is in the building of apartments, but the growth in approvals of new houses is also dropping. A year ago the approvals of houses in New South Wales were growing by 26%; now it is just 8% \u2013 the lowest since November 2012: This drop-off was also reflected in the housing finance data released last week. The total value of owner-occupier housing finance grew by just 0.06% in the past year \u2013 down from 18% in December 2013. And while the annual growth of finance for the construction of new dwellings remains positive at 11%, it is still well down on the 20% this time last year. And even the growth of investor financing, which is believed to have driven much of the increase in housing prices in Sydney in the past 18 months, has dropped off considerably. In December 2013, investor financing for dwellings was growing by 34% a year \u2013 now it is half that at 17%: It all suggests a lot of heat is coming out of the housing market quite quickly. While this should reduce the growth of prices and will be welcomed by those trying to get on the housing ladder, the RBA \u2013 and the government \u2013 will be worried if housing construction continues to slow. While the RBA is always mindful of employment, its main remit is to watch inflation. But inflation at the moment is hardly a worry at all. With oil prices halving in the past six months, and wages growth at record lows, the problem isn\u2019t that the there is too much heat in the economy, but that it is too cold. And when the economy finds itself in times of trouble, the RBA governor comes speaking words of wisdom. Whether lower rates will be the answer we\u2019ll have to wait to see, but I can\u2019t imagine Glenn Stevens will be content to let them be.",
