      "bodyText": "A leading thinktank has warned the government it risks worsening inequality during workers\u2019 lifetimes by cutting tax credits and reducing income tax rates for the richest. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the long-term positives of higher in-work benefit payments were clear, citing a study of workers\u2019 finances over the past 70 years. In the absence of higher income tax rates, top-up payments from tax credits and other in-work benefits were the main reason the income gap closed over a worker\u2019s lifetime. The study will add to the pressure on George Osborne to explain how the mix of tax and benefit changes in recent budgets will avoid widening the income gap between rich and poor. The chancellor was criticised after the July budget when he said that a higher minimum wage \u2013 which he called the \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 would offset the effect of widespread tax credit cuts. At the time, the IFS warned that the \u00a34bn extra income resulting from the rise in the minimum wage would fail to balance \u00a312bn in welfare cuts. In its latest report, the tax and spending thinktank said policymakers needed to be aware that the impact of the cuts would be felt over a worker\u2019s lifetime, entrenching the wedge between the rich and lower-income workers. It said that perceptions of an underclass of families out of work for most of their lives was misplaced and that almost all workers were in employment for a majority of their working lives. This finding meant that tax credits for people in work had the biggest effect on closing income inequality. The report said tax credits also avoided creating a bigger poverty trap, which deters jobseekers from finding work when their out-of-work benefit incomes rose above wage levels. Barra Roantree, one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThe sharp distinction often made in policy debates between working and non-working families is not especially useful: in reality very few individuals are permanently out of work, the poor are not always poor and, albeit to a lesser extent, the rich are not always rich.\u201d He said income taxes on the richest earners were effective at generating income for the government and reducing inequality, in sharp contrast to the government\u2019s view that higher tax rates on the better off fail to produce higher receipts. The figures include most personal taxes and benefits, but do not take into account business taxes or the benefits from public service spending. The report pointed out that while existing studies showed almost two-thirds of individuals paid more in taxes than they received in social security in a single year, more than nine in 10 individuals paid more over their lifetime. Part of the reason for the reduction in tax burden related to the way the tax and benefit system takes from an individual at one age and gives back to them at another. It said large numbers of people were in and out of work or in receipt of social security benefits for particular problems such as sickness or bereavement. \u201cIn a single year, 64% of individuals in the UK pay more in taxes than they receive in social security. But most individuals experience considerable change over their lifetimes: for example those not in paid work in one year are often in work in another year,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cExtending the period of analysis from a single year to an entire lifetime increases the percentage who pay more in taxes than they receive in social security to 93%.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "High-speed internet access via smartphones could become a feature on European airline flights following a deal involving the German carrier Lufthansa \u2013 but voice calls will be blocked at first. Lufthansa will offer Wi-Fi on its short- and medium-haul flights from 2017, provided by the satellite firm Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom. The companies claim their venture, which combines ground-based mobile broadband networks and the nascent satellite networks already used on some planes, will permit a more reliable, faster connection than passengers currently experience. Although Lufthansa is the only airline trialling the network so far, Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom claim it will eventually provide sufficient capacity for planes across Europe\u2019s flightpaths. Airlines have focused on offering Wi-Fi connectivity on long-haul flights, but the services have been a long way from replicating the broadband speeds on the ground. One European airline, Norwegian, offers free Wi-Fi aboard its planes. Lufthansa is to start rolling out broadband internet access to passengers on its planes from next year using existing satellite connectivity, but Carsten Spohr, the airline\u2019s chief executive, said they were thinking further ahead: \u201cWe want to engage in the development of next-generation technology. \u201cThe provision of reliable, consistent broadband connectivity aboard our planes, which will match that of high-speed home broadband in terms of speed and quality, is of extreme importance to us.\u201d Spohr suggested passengers would be able to book flights or order groceries for home delivery after they land \u2013 but will probably block Skype-style calls that would disturb neighbouring passengers. The price of using onboard Wi-Fi is likely to be linked to the ticket price and class of travel, with benefits for frequent travellers. Deutsche Telekom will build a new mobile broadband network of approximately 300 masts with a far greater range than most conventional sites, able to transmit data over a range of 80km and to the operating altitude of passenger planes. Once the plane is at an altitude of more than 10,000 feet, the ground-based network would work alongside Inmarsat\u2019s satellite, which would in effect fill in gaps in the coverage \u2013 with switching between signals managed in the plane. While most inflight Wi-Fi has been slow, the industry sees it as a major attraction to lure customers onboard. However, the prospect of high-speed internet access to facilitate communication in the sky has not been universally welcomed. A US government watchdog recently warned that onboard Wi-Fi could enable hackers on commercial flights to bring down the plane. Its Accountability Office said that would-be attackers could exploit new vulnerabilities: \u201cThis interconnectedness can potentially provide unauthorised remote access to aircraft avionics systems.\u201d",

Yet the backers plough on regardless because they have invested so much time, money and energy. As financial assumptions are undermined, and delays occur, new reasons to proceed are invented. In this way, the project acquires a life of its own. Completion, at almost any cost, becomes the priority. Hinkley Point C, the government\u2019s hoped-for \u00a324.5bn nuclear power station in Somerset, is a classic of this genre. Once upon a time, it was possible to believe that a new nuclear fleet in the UK could provide reliable, low-carbon energy at a reasonable price to consumers. Yet two of those goals \u2013 reliability and cheap generation \u2013 simply aren\u2019t going to be delivered by Hinkley Point, and it\u2019s about time the government admitted as much. On the reliability front, Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors are struggling to open for business elsewhere on the continent. EDF\u2019s plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule. \u201cOur view is that EPR\u2019s future is bleak: too big, too costly, and still unproven,\u201d said HSBC\u2019s analysts last month. In terms of costs to consumers, the agreed price is horrendous. Hinkley\u2019s output will be guaranteed at \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour, rising with the rate of inflation every year for 35 years. That rate is more than twice the current wholesale price. Even onshore wind is cheaper; by 2023, Hinkley\u2019s latest estimated opening date, offshore wind may be too. Yet still the farce continues. In Monday\u2019s episode, the chancellor, George Osborne, tried to do EDF\u2019s job by encouraging wavering Chinese investors to commit their slug of the financing for Hinkley. He announced a \u00a32bn loan guarantee (the first of a potential \u00a316bn) and half-promised something far more interesting to his hosts \u2013 the chance to construct their own nuclear reactor, build to a different design, in Essex. This is undignified stuff for a UK chancellor. If the Chinese don\u2019t want to fund Hinkley despite all the subsidies and guarantees thrown at the project, too bad. The Treasury could fund the thing itself, if it really wanted to, without making semi-promises to Chinese nuclear constructors. Osborne, instead of travelling to Beijing to plead for cash, would have done better to stay at home and order an independent review of Hinkley\u2019s economics. He might find, as HSBC did, that there is \u201clittle logic for the UK government committing to the existing EPR model\u201d. Unfortunately, there is now little chance of that happening \u2013 Hinkley must proceed because the government has decided that a U-turn would be too embarrassing. RSA jilted with no suitors Stephen Hester and RSA refrained from calling Zurich Insurance a bunch of timewasters but it would have been a reasonable insult to throw. After two months of negotiations, and with an agreed price of 550p a share on the table, the Swiss retired meekly on Monday, pleading the need to get their own house in order before attempting a \u00a35.6bn takeover. This is limp stuff from Zurich. Insurers exist to handle losses and cannot be surprised when a big claim arrives. In this case, the supposed deal-breaker was a $275m whack from the port of Tianjin explosion in China. In reality, if such a sum could undermine a run at RSA, the bid approach was probably wrong-headed in the first place. Martin Senn, Zurich boss, has some explaining to do to his shareholders. As for Hester, he is now obliged to go back to plan A, which means completing the disposal programme (the operation in the Middle East is the last remaining big one) and cutting costs in the UK, Scandinavia and Canada. The strategy makes sense since RSA, in terms of efficiency and underwriting, is off the pace set by traditional rival Aviva. Yet, in the current low-interest rate climate, where investment income generates next to nothing, the prospect is one of hard graft. Consolidation is still the likely long-term trend for this industry so, one of these years, RSA may reappear in the takeover window. But, for now, RSA shareholders are obliged to confront one uncomfortable lesson from this episode: despite all the chat about rival bidders when Zurich announced its approach in July, nobody turned up. In the circumstances, you can understand why RSA\u2019s share price settled almost 10% below the pre-approach level. CMA delay They are busy folk at the Competition and Markets Authority, where they are investigating the state of play in two big politically sensitive markets \u2013 banking and energy. No surprise, then, that timetables are slipping. Provisional findings on retail and small-business banking are due next month, having originally been planned for this month. On energy, full findings have been pushed out to next June, instead of this Christmas. A lot of people have a lot of opinions, it seems, and \u201cthe inquiry group also wants to ensure it has sufficient time to conclude the further evidence-gathering and analysis required for the final report\u201d. Fair enough \u2013 and it\u2019s best to ensure the analyses and remedies are robust. But the CMA could do itself a favour by not wasting time on silly inquiries like the study of Poundland\u2019s acquisition of 99p Stores. It took two attempts to arrive at the correct (and obvious) answer that competition would not be harmed.",

The Treasury could fund the thing itself, if it really wanted to, without making semi-promises to Chinese nuclear constructors.</p> <p>Osborne, instead of travelling to Beijing to plead for cash, would have done better to stay at home and order an independent review of Hinkley\u2019s economics. He might find, as HSBC did, that there is \u201clittle logic for the UK government committing to the existing EPR model\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is now little chance of that happening \u2013 Hinkley must proceed because the government has decided that a U-turn would be too embarrassing.</p> <h2>RSA jilted with no suitors</h2> <p>Stephen Hester and RSA refrained from calling Zurich Insurance a bunch of timewasters but it would have been a reasonable insult to throw. After two months of negotiations, and with an agreed price of 550p a share on the table, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/zurich-abandons-rsa-takeover-bid-after-tianjin-blasts\">Swiss retired meekly on Monda</a>y, pleading the need to get their own house in order before attempting a \u00a35.6bn takeover.</p> <p>This is limp stuff from Zurich. Insurers exist to handle losses and cannot be surprised when a big claim arrives. In this case, the supposed deal-breaker was a $275m whack from the port of Tianjin explosion in China. In reality, if such a sum could undermine a run at RSA, the bid approach was probably wrong-headed in the first place. Martin Senn, Zurich boss, has some explaining to do to his shareholders.</p> <p>As for Hester, he is now obliged to go back to plan A, which means completing the disposal programme (the operation in the Middle East is the last remaining big one) and cutting costs in the UK, Scandinavia and Canada. The strategy makes sense since RSA, in terms of efficiency and underwriting, is off the pace set by traditional rival Aviva. Yet, in the current low-interest rate climate, where investment income generates next to nothing, the prospect is one of hard graft.</p> <p>Consolidation is still the likely long-term trend for this industry so, one of these years, RSA may reappear in the takeover window. But, for now, RSA shareholders are obliged to confront one uncomfortable lesson from this episode: despite all the chat about rival bidders when Zurich announced its approach in July, nobody turned up.</p> <p>In the circumstances, you can understand why RSA\u2019s share price settled almost 10% below the pre-approach level.</p> <h2>CMA delay</h2> <p>They are busy folk at the Competition and Markets Authority, where they are investigating the state of play in two big politically sensitive markets \u2013 banking and energy.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/competition-watchdog-extends-deadline-energy-industry-report\">Competition watchdog extends deadline for UK energy industry report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No surprise, then, that timetables are slipping.

      "bodyText": "As Alexis Tsipras becomes prime minister for the second time, the mood on the streets of Athens is hardly euphoric. Helena Smith reports: A huge storm, violent, dark and loud rumbled through Greece on Monday, thunder and lightning skittering through the skies. After Sunday\u2019s general elections it was not lost on many: in Athens residents saw in the tempest a perfect metaphor, an omen even, that the old was finally being washed away. \u201cPeople voted for change, for what they believed would be a fresh start,\u201d said Lefteris Pavlis who owns a chain of eateries in the city centre. \u201cThey voted to give Alexis Tsipras a second chance which says a lot about the state of the opposition.\u201d And yet the triumphant return to power of the young leftist and his Syriza party \u2013 this time pledging to overturn the old order of corruption, cronyism and vested interests - was not uppermost in the minds of most. What was uppermost was the daily grind of living. \u201cThere are problems,\u201d sighed Vangelis Evangelides who sells nuts in the narrow streets beneath the ancient Acropolis. \u201cLots of problems. Will Syriza be able to solve them?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s hope they can.\u201d Almost six years into their worst financial crisis in modern times Greeks are exhausted, weary of self-examination, worn down by economic and political uncertainty and the depredations of austerity. On the streets Monday, outside banks and kiosks and shops, the mood, if anything, was strangely sombre. \u201cWhat election?\u201d quipped Panagiotis Katsanos who runs a kiosk on Mitropoleos street in Athens\u2019 city centre. From 7 am to 1 pm around 150 people had stopped by to say \u2018good morning\u2019 or buy cigarettes, newspapers and soft-drinks but not a single person had mentioned the election. \u201cI\u2019m telling you not one person,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cNobody cares because the feeling is they are all the same, they all tell lies, so what\u2019s the difference.\u201d In the vegetable stalls off Athinas street, vendors echoed that view. \u201cTen people this morning have had me weigh olives,\u201d said Tassos Kounoupiotis. \u201cWe have got to that point where money is so tight. Politics and politicians belong to another world.\u201d It was clear as pollsters took stock of the election result that voter apathy \u2013 the force behind an abstention rate that at almost 44% reached a record high \u2013 has now become the reality of Greece. Tsipras is the fifth prime minister to be voted into office since the crisis began. In winning his gamble for a fresh, four-year mandate he has emerged as the dominant figure in Greek political life but for many his victory does not reflect them. That, say analysts, will make implementation of the draconian reforms international creditors are demanding in return for a third rescue programme of \u20ac86bn in bailout funds harder still. The snap poll saw very little discussion of the spending cuts and reforms the new administration will now have to embark on. A Greek default and ejection from the euro zone will loom if they are not enforced, \u201cIt was incredible that a man who betrayed every single promise he ever made, who oversaw a period where the banks were closed and capital controls were enforced, who played such a big part in worsening the economy, was again voted in so spectacularly,\u201d said Plavlis. \u201cThe controls have eased it\u2019s true, but every small business is having a really hard time,\u201d he lamented. But, he said, it was undeniable that the era of Tsipras was now upon Greece. \u201cHe has promised the sun will shine there are a lot of people out there who are going to be hoping today\u2019s storm isn\u2019t his first broken promise.\u201d On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Meanwhile Alexis Tsipras has officially been sworn in as prime minister. Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said the real winner in the weekend election is the troika of creditors, the ECB, EU and IMF. Writing in the Guardian he says: During the past five years, troika-authored bills made it through parliament on ultra-slim majorities, giving their authors sleepless nights. Now, the bills necessary to prop up the third bailout will pass with comfortable majorities, as Syriza is committed to them. Almost every opposition MP (with the exception of the communists of KKE and the Nazis of Golden Dawn) is also on board. Of course, to get to this point Greek democracy has had to be deeply wounded (1.6 million Greeks who voted in the July referendum did not bother to turn up at the polling stations on Sunday) \u2013 no great loss to bureaucrats in Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington DC for whom democracy appears, in any case, to be a nuisance. Tsipras must now implement a fiscal consolidation and reform programme that was designed to fail. Illiquid small businesses, with no access to capital markets, have to now pre-pay next year\u2019s tax on their projected 2016 profits. Households will need to fork out outrageous property taxes on non-performing apartments and shops, which they can\u2019t even sell. VAT rate hikes will boost VAT evasion. Week in week out, the troika will be demanding more recessionary, antisocial policies: pension cuts, lower child benefits, more foreclosures. The prime minister\u2019s plan for weathering this storm is founded on three pledges. First the agreement with the troika is unfinished business, leaving room for further negotiation of important details; second, debt relief will follow soon; and third Greece\u2019s oligarchs will be tackled. Voters supported Tsipras because he appeared the most likely candidate to deliver on these promises. The trouble is, his capacity to do so is severely circumscribed by the agreement he has already signed. More here: The victory by Alexis Tsipras in Greece\u2019s election at the weekend does not seemed to have spooked the markets, but nor has it enthused them much either. In fact it was Wall Street\u2019s recovery from Friday\u2019s Federal Reserve-induced losses that provided much of the support for shares during the day. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 4.6p or 0.08% to 6108.71 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.33% to 9948.51 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.09% at 4585.5 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.12% to 21,755.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.1% at 9856.8 In Greece the Athens market dipped 0.58% to 693.54 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up nearly 80 points or 0.5%. Back with Greece, and Alexis Tsipras does not have long to wait to regain his role as prime minister: (These are local times). Part of the reason for the rise in US markets could be weak housing figures, which would add to the general feeling that a rate rise this year may not actually materialise. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It is debatable whether the miss in US existing home sales, down to 5.31m against the 5.5m expected, helped the US indices with their gains; traditionally in 2015 weak American data has been a boost to the markets, but the violent reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates the same last week complicates the bad data/strong Dow relationship that had been so strong this year. Yet it is likely that there has been a slight correction in regards to last Friday\u2019s fall, helping the Dow Jones to tentatively re-cross the 16500 mark. A quick look at the markets. Wall Street has recovered some of the losses it suffered on Friday, following the news that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates on hold and was concerned about the state of the global economy, particularly China. Ahead of a raft of Fed members speaking this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently nearly 150 points or 0.9% higher. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 0.27%, hit by the news that a tie-up between Zurich and RSA Insurance has fallen apart, leaving RSA shares 21% lower. Germany\u2019s Dax is virtually flat, up just 0.06% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.91%. In Athens, the market is down 0.58% following Alexis Tsipras\u2019 election victory. And here are the final results of the Greek election: Is another show down between Athens and Europe on the horizon before the new government is even sworn in? The Independent Greeks party has just issued a withering statement in response to remarks made earlier by the president of the European parliament Martin\u2019s Schulz, reports Helena Smith in Athens. The German has repeatedly said that he (and others) would have preferred Syriza to have teamed up with parties from the centre left such as To Potami. This morning, he admitted calling Tsipras to ask \u201cwhy he was continuing a coalition with this strange, far-right party.\u201d Admonishing Schulz for the intervention, the Independent Greeks have now implied that the European Parliament president is being funded by defence industries! \u201cOnce again we express our sadness at Mr Schulz\u2019s lack of respect for the institution that he serves with his interventions in the internal affairs of a country,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBeyond insulting the Greek people and the party of Independent Greeks, he must, at last, understand that he cannot, without consequence, call any party that doesn\u2019t take commissions from the defence industries that fund him \u201cextreme right.\u201d The Independent Greeks are conservative, nationalist and have close links with the Greek Orthodox church. Party leader Panos Kammenos once famously put down the failure of Greeks to revolt against austerity to secret mind-altering substances being sprayed over them (by who we do not know). The two parties differ on issues ranging from immigration, the state\u2019s contentious relationship with the Church and gay rights (to name but a few) but Syriza cadres, a mixture of Marxists, greens, Maoists and old-style socialists say the alliance between the two went very well during their first term in office. Time for a quick recap of the key points Alexis Tsipras is meeting with top aides now to agree a new cabinet, after yesterday\u2019s election success. He\u2019s expected to reappoint Euclid Tsakalotos, the former finance minister, to his cabinet, but possibly in a new role. Tsipras should be sworn in tonight as prime minister, but perhaps not until 8pm local time (6pm BST). He is still expected to form a second coalition with the Independent Greeks party, after talks in a rain-drenched Athens. Tsipras also been deluged with some rather pointed congratulations messages from European politicians. European Council president Donald Tusk, and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, have both warned that Greece must move fast to implement the bailout programme. European parliament president Martin Schulz has annoyed some in Greece, after criticising Tsipras for teaming up with Kammenos\u2019s \u2018strange, far-right\u2019 party Fitch, the ratings agency, has warned it could downgrade Greece if it clashes with its creditors over a bailout programme again. Greek bond yields strengthened this morning, as traders gave a cautious welcome to the election result. Nick Fletcher will steer you through the next few hours. Alexis Tsipras and Panos Kammenos are all smiles in Athens today, as they finalise their new government. European stock markets have mainly risen today. Tsipras\u2019s comprehensive win last night\u2019s has calms fears that another election might be needed this year. As Guy Foster of Brewer Dolphin explains, there is short-term relief, but problems on the horizon. Ultimately the return of Tsipras is the safest option in the short run. It means both the government and opposition are committed to ensuring thr terms of the bailout are implemented. (In the long run, however, the unsustainability of Greece\u2019s debt burden is extreme and makes economic porgress incomprehensibly difficult. We expect, therefore, that unless the creditors can find a politically acceptable way of offering debt relief, the Greek crisis will return. The German DAX is being dragged back by the scandal that has hit Volkswagen. Its shares have slumped by 20% after it was accused of falsify emissions data. Here\u2019s a video clip of Tsipras triumphantly claiming victory last night, for those who didn\u2019t catch it at the time. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has put his summer spat with Alexis Tsipras behind them. In his letter of congratulation, Juncker vowed to \u201cstand by Greece\u201d and support the new government as it implements the new measures agreed under the bailout. Juncker added his voice to those urging Tsipras to deliver reforms quickly, and cited the refugee crisis ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders on Wednesday night. Here\u2019s the letter. You might remember that the pair fell out badly in June, after the Greek PM accused creditors of trying to humiliate his country. The Commission president hit back, saying he felt betrayed by Tsipras\u2019s antics. Over in Athens officials are saying that it is more than likely the former finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will be given a cabinet role - but they are keeping mum as to what that position will be. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Asked about the rumours that he\u2019s been reappointed as FM, one aid told us: \u201cI think for sure he will be back but in what position nobody knows,\u201d. The Oxford-educated economist has repeatedly said that the bailout accord he signed in July is not the best of agreements. \u201cIt is a difficult agreement,\u201d he told Star TV as the first exit polls rolled in revealing that the leftists were heading to victory. Tsakalotos is a prominent figure in the dissident faction known as the Group of 53 - Syriza cadres who ideologically share many of the beliefs of the breakaway militant Left Platform but in the name of governance support the more pragmatic stance of those coalesced around Tsipras. He reportedly wavered before standing in the elections. It is likely that the British-trained academic - among the few straight talkers on the Greek political scene - will prefer a different post connected to the economy (and the country\u2019s crucial need for investments) but not necessarily in the hot seat of the finance minister. George Chouliarakis, another UK-trained economist - he lectured at Manchester University before going into politics - who has won plaudits heading the ministry in the interim government and would likely retain the position if Tsakalotos doesn\u2019t replace him. Rating agency Fitch has warned that there is still a high risk that Greece\u2019s bailout programme flounders, triggering a new downgrade. In its first comment on the election, Fitch says: Greece\u2019s general election looks set to deliver a more cohesive administration with a renewed mandate for the country\u2019s third bailout agreement, slightly reducing risks to programme implementation. But the government\u2019s ownership of the programme is likely to remain less than whole-hearted, and its negotiating stance unpredictable. Fitch explains that the first review of the programme, due this autumn, is the most \u2018onerous\u2019 It includes contentious pension and tax reforms and a supplementary budget, but its successful completion would unlock at least modest official-sector debt relief, a key goal for the government. Fitch is particularly worried that Tsipras\u2019s political rhetoric still contains an anti-austerity element, even though Syriza is committed to implement the programme. For example, Tsipras said following Sunday\u2019s vote that Greece can recover from its economic crisis \u201cthrough tough work,\u201d but that \u201cthe Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity.\u201d So it will be tricky to rebuild trust between Greece and its creditors, and hard to win domestic political and popular backing for the third bailout. Fitch had upgraded Greece\u2019s rating to \u2018CCC\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019 last month, after its bailout was agreed. But it could act again: A repeat of the prolonged breakdown in relations between Greece and its creditors leading to another funding crisis could bring the rating back down. A record of successful programme implementation could lead to an upgrade, as could economic recovery, further primary surpluses, and official-sector debt relief. Tsipras has also told Syriza officials that the \u201cfirst big battle\u201d will be the discussions over debt relief. Those discussions could start once Greece has passed the first review of its new bailout. Reuters newsflash: Alexis Tsipras has told his party members that the new government\u2019s top priority is to restore stability to the economy, and to the banking system. Greek media are reporting that Euclid Tsakalotos has been reappointed as Greece\u2019s finance minister. Tsakalotos won plaudits for his brief stint in the role over the summer. He was installed after Yanis Varoufakis resigned, and played a key role in negotiating the third bailout deal at a series of eurogroup crisis meetings. So it could be a popular appointment with the markets. Over in Athens Alexis Tsipras\u2019 office has announced that the leftist Syriza leader is about hold a meeting his new comrade in arms, Panos Kammenos, our correspondent Helena Smith. Tsipras will meet the Independent Greeks party leader at Syriza\u2019s party HQ in Athens form 3pm local time (ie now). The new cabinet make-up is expected to be discussed. At least two former ministers have told Helena they expect to be re-instated to their old posts. One said: \u201cOur plan is to change everything. To turn everything in the public administration around to get it working efficently.\u201d Martin Schulz\u2019s criticism of Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner hasn\u2019t pleased some citizens in Greece, who feel the European Parliament chief has no business interfering in national politics: From Pireas @aprositicat says: Blog reader James Wilkins of Thessaloniki agrees that Schulz should keep out. Martin Schulz\u2019s intervention about Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner once again shows how little he respects Greece even though he calls himself a friend. Greece isn\u2019t the only country where coalitions are a reality, he adds: I always thought the coalition in Germany a bad idea but it is a matter of opinion. Golden Dawn, Greece\u2019s extremist party, came third in Sunday\u2019s election. GD grew its share of the vote, from 6.3% in January to 7% this time. It polled well among the unemployed, and those who live on Greek islands hit hard by the refugee crisis. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith explains: In terms of absolute numbers Golden Dawn was the only party to hold its ground,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, political commentator and Athens University professor. \u201cIt was not at all affected by the very high rate of [electoral] abstention. Its performance is a danger and disgrace for our democracy.\u201d Bloomberg has also looked at GD\u2019s success. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cThe eastern Aegean islands have many angry voters who feel the massive refugee inflow is destroying them financially largely because of the impact on tourism,\u201d said George Pagoulatos, professor at the Athens University of Economics and Business. \u201cIf the European Union fails to integrate the migrants, that would only raise the popularity and appeal of xenophobic and extreme right-wing parties in Europe.\u201d More here: Greek Election Triumph for Left Masks Gains for the Far Right There\u2019s no shortage of top Brussels politicians with advice for Greece\u2019s leader. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner responsible for the euro, has called for Alexis Tsipras to get his new government in place fast. Once those reforms are agreed, debt relief is a possibility, Dombrovskis added. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas had told reporters that the EC \u201ccongratulates Alexis Tsipras for his victory\u201d. Schinas then reminded hacks at that Tsipras\u2019s first government committed to an \u201cambitious programme of reforms\u201d. \u201cThe new government will now have the mandate to carry out those reforms... There is a lot of work ahead and no time to lose.\u201d European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has also told Tsipras that it\u2019s time to deliver. Ouch. Martin Schulz, head of the European Parliament, has launched a blunt attack on Alexis Tsipras for reforming his coalition with the Independent Greeks. Schulz told France Inter radio that he couldn\u2019t understand why Tsipras would leap back into an alliance with the right-wingers. He said: \u201cI called him (Tsipras) a second time to ask him why he was continuing a coalition with this strange, far-right party. \u201cHe pretty much didn\u2019t answer. He is very clever, especially by telephone. He told me things that seemed convincing, but which ultimately in my eyes are a little bizarre.\u201d (quote via Reuters) Political analysts were shocked in January when Syriza and the Independent Greeks first teamed up. The radical left-wing alliance and the populist, nationalist right-wingers appeared unlikely allies, bound only by a joint hatred of austerity and Brussels bailouts. Eurocrats would probably have been happier if Tsipras had paired up with a moderate, pro-EU group like To Potami, or perhaps Pasok, Greece\u2019s mainstream socialist party. Instead, Tsipras is sticking with Panos Kammenos, head of the Independent Greeks. Kammenos caused a stir in March when he reportedly threatened to unleash a wave of Syrian migrants across Europe unless Greece\u2019s creditors provided more help. Greek newspapers are hailing the Tsipras Era, after last night\u2019s success. UBS, the Swiss bank, has warned that Greece could still leave the single currency in the next year if its latest bailout programme flounders. Vladimir Putin has also congratulated Tsipras. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Putin congratulated the Greek leader in a telegram and \u201cexpressed hope for the continuation of constructive dialogue and active shared work for the future strengthening of mutually beneficial Russian-Greek cooperation\u201d, the Kremlin said in a statement. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has urged Alexis Tsipras to work \u2018constructively\u2019 with the rest of Europe to tackle Greece\u2019s problems. He has sent a short letter to Tsipras, in which he congratulates the new PM on winning Sunday\u2019s elections - and pushed him to show proper leadership on issues such as the refugee crisis. Tusk wrote: Many of the biggest challenges facing the European Union as a whole are the same as those facing Greece as a country, such as the refugee crisis and the creation of sustainable growth and jobs. I trust that Greece, with your new Government will contribute constructively in seeking solutions to all those challenges. Your dedication and leadership in implementing the economic adjustment programme is crucial in order to make a difference in the recovery of the Greek economy. Tusk was a key player in this summer\u2019s Grexit drama, and called the emergency summit in July where the Greek PM capitulated to his creditors\u2019 demands. He reportedly barred the door and refused to allow Tsipras and Angela Merkel to leave the room, when negotiations appeared to have floundered for good after a night of drama and deadlock. There\u2019s no sign of jubilation in Athens this lunchtime, where that nasty storm has driven people dashing for shelter. Greece is no longer the biggest crisis facing the EU: G\u00fcnther Oettinger, European Commissioner for energy, has cautioned the new Greek PM that he can\u2019t start backtracking.... The Greek financial crisis could soon rear up again, if Tsipras cannot get to grips with the huge challenges facing the country. Michael Jacobides, Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship, London Business School, explains: The current government will need to both push through deep reforms and run the country at a time when liquidity has evaporated, the migrant issue has become explosive, and when big decisions (including bank recapitalization, dealing with Non Performing Loans) are still ahead. If the new government exhibits the same lack of managerial and administrative competence that we saw in the last few months, trouble will soon rise. Early reports on the government composition are worrisome. Early indications suggest there will be few changes to key ministers, despite significant issues with operational efficiency over the last few months. Barring pleasant surprises, Greece may return to the news headlines sooner than we would wish. The head of Spain\u2019s anti-austerity party, Pablo Iglesias of Podemos, has spoken with Tsipras over the phone to offer his congratulations, Ashifa Kassam reports. On Sunday night, shortly after right-wing New Democracy conceded defeat, Iglesias took to twitter to congratulate Tsipras, saying: \u201cThe Greek are very clearly saying who they want as prime minister. Congratulations @tsipras_eu. Strength, my friend.\u201d Hours later, Iglesias relayed his message to Tsipras in a phone conversation. The Greek election divided Spain\u2019s anti-austerity Podemos party, with Iglesias throwing his support behind Tsipras, while others in the party backed Popular Unity. Last week two elected Podemos politicians from Andalusia, Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez and Jes\u00fas Romero, travelled to Greece to rally behind the breakaway party of anti-austerity MPs. \u201cSupporting Tsipras now is crazy,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez told Spanish news site El Diario. \u201cSupporting Tsipras will cost us, it\u2019s going to make it tough to win the elections, because what Tsipras did was consolidate the dominant discourse of bipartisanship that there is no alternative, no possibility of change.\u201d Here\u2019s some welcome news - the flow of capital out Greece which began a year ago appears to have ended. That\u2019s via Mark Whitehouse of Bloomberg View, who calls it a glimmer of hope for Tsipras. Since the government reached a deal with its European creditors in July, people have started bringing money back into the country. Let\u2019s be clear: The months of negotiations between Greece and its creditors, and the agreement that ensued, are nothing short of a political and economic fiasco. Europe, and particularly Germany, imposed terms that -- though they include some much-deemed reforms -- will stifle growth in the near term and leave the government even deeper in debt, if the country\u2019s leaders can even follow through. Greece\u2019s economy, which had been poised to start recovering, is now expected to shrink through 2016. That said, data from the Greek central bank -- which records a liability for every euro that leaves the country\u2019s banking system -- suggest that the end of the standoff has at least brought a bit of relief. Politico has a handy list of the key points from yesterday\u2019s poll. Greeks are sick of elections. Turnover hitting its lowest level on record, with almost half of voters staying away after a muted election campaign The Greek people have not punished Syriza despite a chaotic seven months in power. Tsipras has only lost four seats, despite not delivering on his commitments from July. Time for more of the same. Syriza and the Independent Greeks moved quickly to agree another coalition last night The leftist rebels have been soundly defeated. Popular Unity, led by former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, didn\u2019t attract enough support to enter parliament. The hard work starts now. Tsipras now has to implement the harsh bailout terms agreed this summer. Syriza has benefited from being a left-wing party. Unions and anti-austerity campaigners would have protested more fiercely about the third bailout had the right-wing New Democracy party caved into it. The Athens stock market has dipped a little this morning, as Syriza\u2019s surprise victory fails to thrill traders. Piraeus Bank was the biggest gainer, up 4%, but Alpha Bank dropped by 3.4%. The main ATG index is down 0.5%, and has eben Fund manager Costis Morianos, head of Athens-based Asset Wise Capital Management, says investors had expected Tsipras to get back in. He said (via Reuters): \u201cThe market had pretty much discounted a Syriza win and there is some profit taking, but prices are attractive.\u201d The market is down 15% so far this year, having recovered from its lows in July. Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence is worried that Tsipras and his Independent Greek (Anel) allies lack the skills to reform the country: Another SYRIZA-ANEL deal also means that the cabinet will once more be composed of politicians with limited capacity and competence, as demonstrated before. While the government can most likely continue to rely on mainstream parties for support during key votes, implementing the approved measures will remain challenging. During the election, Tsipras vowed to improve the bailout deal if he was re-elected. And Piccoli fears ructions between Greece and its lenders, if Tsipras doesn\u2019t take full ownership of the measures. Tsipras has been rewarded for presenting himself as a critic of the bailout, and another deal with ANEL indicates that he will not move on this front. The failure of the anti-austerity Popular Unity party to hit the 3% vote threshold means that most of Greece\u2019s new MPs will support the new bailout deal (officially at least) MoU = memorandum of understanding, the measures Greece agreed with its creditors in return for the third loan deal. Hopefully the rain, hail and thunder that just struck Athens isn\u2019t an omen..... Alexis Tsipras\u2019s \u201csurprisingly convincing victory\u201d means that the Greek drama is relegated to the sidelines again, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. Syriza\u2019s January election victory was clearly more a function of wanting to get rid of the establishment parties associated with crony capitalism and corruption, rather than vote against \u201causterity\u201d. In the bond market, Greece\u2019s sovereign debt is strengthening in value as traders react to the election result. This has pushed down the yield on Greek two-year debt, from 10.9% to 10.55%. Lower yields mean higher prices, indicating the debt is seen as a safer bet. Tsipras\u2019s success hasn\u2019t had much impact on the euro, which is trading flat against the US dollar at $1.1313. Simon Smith, chief economist at the currency trader FxPro, explains \u201cIn the wider picture, it\u2019s not going to make life any easier for the likes of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank and the negotiations surrounding debt sustainability over the coming months.\u201d Here\u2019s the result, with just a few tens of thousands of votes still to be counted. Several eurozone politicians have already congratulated Tsipras on his victory, including French president Francois Hollande and eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem. But they may also be concerned that the new Greek government\u2019s majority actually be narrower than the old one. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts more instability. But there\u2019s a big difference this time -- Syriza has shed its most radical element, the Left Platform. They split off to form Popular Unity, but have failed to win enough votes to get into parliament. We should remembered that turnout at yesterday\u2019s election hit a record low: Tsipras\u2019s new government will have to move quickly to overhaul the Greek economy. As my colleague Jon Henley explains, the first review of Greece new cash-for-reforms deal is subject to quarterly reviews, with the first due next month. The new government\u2019s first task \u2013 with a new \u20ac3bn tranche of aid at stake \u2013 will be to revise the 2015 budget to take into account major pension and income tax reforms. It must also finalise a procedure to recapitalise Greek banks by December and move fast to remove capital controls imposed earlier this summer to prevent a full-blown bank run. Here\u2019s Jon\u2019s latest dispatch from Athens: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For most politicians, failing to deliver on your election promises, imposing crippling capital controls, and nearly leading your country out of the euro would have career-limiting consequences. But not for Alexis Tsipras, one of the most remarkable and durable leaders to have graced European politics in recent years. Sunday\u2019s general election has seen Tsipras gallop back to power, defying prediction and the pollsters again. With 99% of the votes counted, Tsipras is guaranteed to have won 145 seats in the Greek parliament. He\u2019s set to form a second coalition with the Independent Greeks, who have got 10 seats, giving a majority of just 5 in the Greek parliament. Last night\u2019s celebrations were more muted than in January, given Greece has now signed up to a third bailout, laced with the sort of austerity Tsipras had once promised to consign to history. So now, the hard work starts -- the new PM must now implement the measures agreed with Greece\u2019s creditors, from labour market reform to bank recapitalisation. If you missed yesterday\u2019s action, here\u2019s our latest story: Greek general election: Syriza returns to power We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the Greek vote, and other key events through the day....",

After Sunday\u2019s general elections it was not lost on many: in Athens residents saw in the tempest a perfect metaphor, an omen even, that the old was finally being washed away. </p> <p>\u201cPeople voted for change, for what they believed would be a fresh start,\u201d said Lefteris Pavlis who owns a chain of eateries in the city centre. \u201cThey voted to give Alexis Tsipras a second chance which says a lot about the state of the opposition.\u201d </p> <p>And yet the triumphant return to power of the young leftist and his Syriza party \u2013 this time pledging to overturn the old order of corruption, cronyism and vested interests - was not uppermost in the minds of most. What was uppermost was the daily grind of living.</p> <p>\u201cThere are problems,\u201d sighed Vangelis Evangelides who sells nuts in the narrow streets beneath the ancient Acropolis. \u201cLots of problems. Will Syriza be able to solve them?\u201d he shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s hope they can.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Almost six years into their worst financial crisis in modern times Greeks are exhausted, weary of self-examination, worn down by economic and political uncertainty and the depredations of austerity. </p> <p>On the streets Monday, outside banks and kiosks and shops, the mood, if anything, was strangely sombre. \u201cWhat election?\u201d quipped Panagiotis Katsanos who runs a kiosk on Mitropoleos street in Athens\u2019 city centre. From 7 am to 1 pm around 150 people had stopped by to say \u2018good morning\u2019 or buy cigarettes, newspapers and soft-drinks but not a single person had mentioned the election. \u201cI\u2019m telling you not one person,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cNobody cares because the feeling is they are all the same, they all tell lies, so what\u2019s the difference.\u201d </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddfc28a92e02bfa9f67cfac62d723ed6131392fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddfc28a92e02bfa9f67cfac62d723ed6131392fd/0_0_4618_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walks past a poster of left-wing Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras in Athens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past a poster of Alexis Tsipras in Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In the vegetable stalls off Athinas street, vendors echoed that view. \u201cTen people this morning have had me weigh olives,\u201d said Tassos Kounoupiotis. \u201cWe have got to that point where money is so tight. Politics and politicians belong to another world.\u201d </p> <p>It was clear as pollsters took stock of the election result that voter apathy \u2013 the force behind an abstention rate that at almost 44% reached a record high \u2013 has now become the reality of Greece. Tsipras is the fifth prime minister to be voted into office since the crisis began. In winning his gamble for a fresh, four-year mandate he has emerged as the dominant figure in Greek political life but for many his victory does not reflect them.</p> <p>That, say analysts, will make implementation of the draconian reforms international creditors are demanding in return for a third rescue programme of \u20ac86bn in bailout funds harder still. The snap poll saw very little discussion of the spending cuts and reforms the new administration will now have to embark on. A Greek default and ejection from the euro zone will loom if they are not enforced, </p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that a man who betrayed every single promise he ever made, who oversaw a period where the banks were closed and capital controls were enforced, who played such a big part in worsening the economy, was again voted in so spectacularly,\u201d said Plavlis. \u201cThe controls have eased it\u2019s true, but every small business is having a really hard time,\u201d he lamented. </p> <p>But, he said, it was undeniable that the era of Tsipras was now upon Greece. </p> <p>\u201cHe has promised the sun will shine there are a lot of people out there who are going to be hoping today\u2019s storm isn\u2019t his first broken promise.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the evening.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British insurer RSA has been left out in the cold by its larger rival Zurich Insurance, which suddenly pulled out of a \u00a35.6bn bid and revealed it faces hefty losses caused by last month\u2019s explosions at the Chinese port of Tianjin. Zurich took the blame for the collapse of the talks the day before it was due to table a formal offer, causing a 21% fall in RSA\u2019s share price. As well as citing a $275m (\u00a3175m) of losses caused by the industrial accident in Tianjin last month, it outlined problems in its US car insurance arm rather than the discovery of any irregularities inside RSA for abandoning the talks. While RSA responded to the unexpected announcement by stressing it was trading better than it had expected, it failed to prevent a \u00a31bn drop in its stock market value after the 106p fall in its shares to 403p. This left the stock below where it was trading when Zurich\u2019s interest in a takeover was first revealed in July. Zurich\u2019s boss Martin Senn started exploring the 550p a bid share for RSA after telling investors he had $3bn of cash to spend on deals. But he was facing tough questions after Zurich blamed the \u201crecent deterioration in the trading performance in the group\u2019s general insurance business\u201d for terminating the talks with RSA just a day before required to make a bid under takeover rules. The collapse of the talks also presented a fresh challenge to Stephen Hester, the RSA boss who stood to receive \u00a38.5m if the deal was completed after joining only 18 months ago being forced out of Royal Bank of Scotland. One his first moves was tapping shareholders for \u00a3773m and shrinking the business to focus on the UK &amp; Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada. \u201cStephen Hester had almost done a classic turnaround by cleansing the business of poorly performing businesses [and] selling it shortly thereafter without the need to demonstrate that his strategy was sound. Unfortunately for RSA shareholders it now looks as if he is going to have to deliver earnings growth on the businesses he now has left. Close but no cigar,\u201d said Barrie Cornes, analyst at stockbroker Panmure. \u201cWhile RSA says that trading in July and August are above expectations we maintain our view that this trading outlook for RSA is very poor and that the outlook for earnings growth is poor,\u201d said Cornes. Other bidders, who were predicted to emerge when Zurich was forced to admit its interest, have not materialised and just hours after the bid collapsed RSA announced the long awaited starting date for Scott Egan, who had been named as its new finance director before the potential Zurich bid emerged. Egan is joining from insurance broker Towergate on 1 October. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether the recent focus on RSA flushes out other corporate interest. Whilst we would not rule this out, we suspect it may take some time,\u201d said Eamonn Flanagan at stockbroker Shore Capital. He took comfort from Zurich\u2019s assertion that its checks on RSA had not forced it to pull out. \u201cZurich has confirmed that its due diligence process found nothing which would have prevented a bid, which should offer RSA\u2019s shareholders solace of sort,\u201d said Flanagan. The unravelling of the deal came when Zurich issued an unscheduled trading update, revealing its general insurance arm would make a $200m loss in the third quarter. It admitted that the $275m cost from claims related to the explosion in the Chinese port of Tianjin in August could rise further. Credit Suisse has previously calculated that the industry-wide cost of the blasts could be up to \u00a3950m, although ratings agency Fitch had warned the total bill could be much higher. Zurich is also taking a $300m hit from its car insurance operations in the US and a detailed review of its general insurance arm is now underway. Both insurers are likely to face hefty bills to pay bankers and lawyers who had been advising on the potential deal. The collapse is a blow to City dealmakers at a time when a string of potential deals are being discussed, including a takeover of London-listed brewer SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev which could enter the top 10 biggest deals of all time.",

      "body": "<p>British insurer RSA has been left out in the cold by its larger rival Zurich Insurance, which suddenly pulled out of a \u00a35.6bn bid and revealed it faces hefty losses caused by last month\u2019s explosions at the Chinese port of Tianjin.</p> <p>Zurich took the blame for the collapse of the talks the day before it was due to table a formal offer, causing a 21% fall in RSA\u2019s share price. As well as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.zurich.com/en/media/news-releases/2015/2015-0921-02\">citing a $275m (\u00a3175m) of losses</a> caused by the industrial accident in<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/13/china-explosions-dozens-feared-dead-blasts-port-tianjin\"> Tianjin</a> last month, it outlined problems in its US car insurance arm rather than the discovery of any irregularities inside RSA for abandoning the talks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While RSA responded to the unexpected announcement by stressing it was trading better than it had expected, it failed to prevent a \u00a31bn drop in its stock market value after the 106p fall in its shares to 403p. This left the stock below where it was trading <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/zurich-insurance-rsa-bid\">when Zurich\u2019s interest in a takeover was first revealed</a> in July. </p> <p>Zurich\u2019s boss Martin Senn started exploring the 550p a bid share for RSA after telling investors he had $3bn of cash to spend on deals. But he was facing tough questions after Zurich blamed the \u201crecent deterioration in the trading performance in the group\u2019s general insurance business\u201d for terminating the talks with RSA just a day before required to make a bid under takeover rules.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The collapse of the talks also presented a fresh challenge to Stephen Hester, the RSA boss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/25/rsa-accepts-provisional-56bn-offer-from-zurich\">who stood to receive \u00a38.5m if the deal was completed</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/stephen-hester-rsa-insurance-ceo-rbs\">joining only </a>18 months ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/rbs-ceo-stephen-hester-quits\">being forced out of Royal Bank of Scotland</a>. One his first moves was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/mar/25/rsa-insurance-773m-cash-call-details\">tapping shareholders for \u00a3773m </a>and shrinking the business to focus on the UK &amp; Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada. </p> <p>\u201cStephen Hester had almost done a classic turnaround by cleansing the business of poorly performing businesses [and] selling it shortly thereafter without the need to demonstrate that his strategy was sound. Unfortunately for RSA shareholders it now looks as if he is going to have to deliver earnings growth on the businesses he now has left. Close but no cigar,\u201d said Barrie Cornes, analyst at stockbroker Panmure.</p> <p>\u201cWhile RSA says that trading in July and August are above expectations we maintain our view that this trading outlook for RSA is very poor and that the outlook for earnings growth is poor,\u201d said Cornes.<br></p> <p>Other bidders, who were predicted to emerge when Zurich was forced to admit its interest, have not materialised and just hours after the bid collapsed RSA announced the long awaited starting date for Scott Egan, who had been named as its new finance director before the potential Zurich bid emerged. Egan is joining from insurance broker Towergate on 1 October.</p> <p>\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the recent focus on RSA flushes out other corporate interest. Whilst we would not rule this out, we suspect it may take some time,\u201d said Eamonn Flanagan at stockbroker Shore Capital.</p> <p>He took comfort from Zurich\u2019s assertion that its checks on RSA had not forced it to pull out.</p> <p>\u201cZurich has confirmed that its due diligence process found nothing which would have prevented a bid, which should offer RSA\u2019s shareholders solace of sort,\u201d said<strong> <br></strong>Flanagan.</p> <p>The unravelling of the deal came when Zurich issued an unscheduled trading update, revealing its general insurance arm would make a $200m loss in the third quarter. It admitted that the $275m cost from claims related to the explosion in the Chinese port of Tianjin in August could rise further. Credit Suisse has previously calculated that the industry-wide cost of the blasts could be up to \u00a3950m, although ratings agency Fitch had warned the total bill could be much higher.</p> <p>Zurich is also taking a $300m hit from its car insurance operations in the US and a detailed review of its general insurance arm is now underway. </p> <p>Both insurers are likely to face hefty bills to pay bankers and lawyers who had been advising on the potential deal. The collapse is a blow to City dealmakers at a time when a string of potential deals are being discussed, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/ab-inbev-deal-could-unite-peroni-budweiser-under-one-roof\">a takeover of London-listed brewer SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev</a> which could enter the top 10 biggest deals of all time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The German government has warned that the Volkswagen emissions fixing scandal is putting at risk the reputation of the country\u2019s automotive industry, as shares in Europe\u2019s largest carmaker slumped by nearly 20%. Shares plunged as investors responded to US accusations that the German carmaker falsified emissions data, an action that could attract penalties of up to $18bn (\u00a311.6bn). The German economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, expressed concern over the impact of what he called \u201ca bad case\u201d for the country\u2019s vital car industry and he urged VW to clear up the allegations. \u201cYou will understand that we are worried that the justifiably excellent reputation of the German car industry and in particular that of Volkswagen suffers,\u201d Gabriel said. The Environmental Protection Agency in the US said on Friday that VW had installed illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software to cheat emission tests, allowing its cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The US government ordered VW to recall 482,000 VW and Audi cars produced since 2009. VW shares closed down 18.6% at \u20ac132.20 on the DAX index in Frankfurt. In the wake of the scandal, two senior VW executives cancelled a planned appearance at a media event in New York with singer Lenny Kravitz scheduled for Monday evening. Herbert Diess, the chairman of the VW brand\u2019s management board, and Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW\u2019s board member in charge of technical development, had planned to attend the event to introduce the latest version of the Passat midsize sedan. The chief executive of VW\u2019s US arm, Michael Horn, will still attend the event. He is expected to provide a statement about the situation but will not be available for media questions. On Sunday, the German carmaker\u2019s chief executive apologised for the scandal. \u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,\u201d Martin Winterkorn said. \u201cVolkswagen has ordered an external investigation of this matter.\u201d VW suspended sales of cars containing the company\u2019s four-cylinder turbo direct injection (TDI) engine on Friday after the investigation. The \u201cclean diesel\u201d engine is commonly used in models including VW\u2019s Beetle, Golf, Jetta, Passat and the A3 luxury compact made by VW-owned Audi. VW could face penalties of $37,500 for each car not in compliance with clean air rules. David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cThis could be very bad indeed. They are recalling cars and that will cost them. There may be a reputational issue and there could be fines that could run into billions. If it is the case that they have been trying to hoodwink regulators, it\u2019s a really dumb thing to do.\u201d Bailey said the US allegations could have wider reverberations for the car industry\u2019s efforts to reassure regulators about its environmental impact. Shares of VW\u2019s German rival carmakers also fell in Germany. BMW shares dropped 3.7% and Daimler\u2019s lost 4.2% \u201cRegulators will look at this more closely now,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThere has been growing concern about diesel cars and nitrous oxide emissions. The industry has been trying to make the case that the latest regulations largely deal with that issue but regulators will now look more closely at whether they have.\u201d The accusations by the agency emerged as VW was seeking to shake off doubts about its leadership at a supervisory board meeting on Friday. Former chairman Ferdinand Piech quit in a power struggle with Winterkorn over strategy five months ago. The company is also grappling with falling sales in China and efforts to boost profitability. \u201cThis disaster is beyond all expectations,\u201d Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Center of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, told Reuters.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Competition watchdog extends deadline for UK energy industry report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Competition and Markets Authority has extended its investigation into the energy industry by six months, in the second delay to a CMA probe this month. The regulator said it had moved the deadline from 25 December to 25 June next year because its inquiry team needs more time to wade through the responses. The CMA said the team, numbering up to 40 people, would aim to beat the new deadline by releasing its provisional proposals in January and publishing its final decision by the end of April. The extension of the politically charged energy investigation follows the recent announcement of another delay to a CMA report. The watchdog backtracked on a pledge to unveil the provisional findings of its inquiry into the banking sector due this month, setting October as a new publication target. Its caseload also includes an investigation into the private healthcare market and a review of BT\u2019s acquisition of mobile phone operator EE. This is the first time the CMA has used the six month extension allowed for its investigations. The regulator said in July that consumers paid about \u00a31.2bn a year too much for domestic energy from the big six providers, including British Gas and SSE. The CMA said consumers spent too much because they did not shop around and that this was particularly true of vulnerable groups who could least afford it. The large energy providers have always denied making excessive profits and are particularly opposed to the CMA\u2019s suggestion that there should be a temporary price cap on bills. Indicating that consumers were not taking advantage of a new breed of lower-cost providers, the CMA said millions of householders could each save up to \u00a3160 a year by switching to a new energy supplier. Industry sources say the CMA has been wavering on the proposed price control, which was also criticised by a group of former regulators, knowing a climbdown would be interpreted as caving in to the big six energy companies. Extending its deadline, the CMA said it needed time to sift through the many responses it had received from energy providers, consumer groups and other interested parties. Its inquiry group then needed time to gather further evidence to come up with workable policy proposals, the regulator said.

Shire is leading the way, up 131p to \u00a348.76 after European regulators approved its Intuniv product as a non-stimulant ADHD treatment for children and adolescents between 6 and 17 years old. At the same time, Barclays analysts lifted their recommendation from equal weight to overweight and raised there target price from \u00a355.64 to 357, partly on merger hopes. Shire is currently considering its options regarding sweetening its all share offer for US Baxalta, which has been rejected as being too low (worth around $45 a share at the time of the original offer).

      "bodyText": "How well did Syriza and Alexis Tsipras do? With 99.5% of the votes counted, Syriza had 35.5% of the vote, easily beating the centre-right New Democracy, the next biggest party on 28.1%. After Tsipras disappointed supporters by accepting a harsh eurozone-led austerity programme finalised in August, leftwingers appeared to be deserting Syriza, with polls showing New Democracy level just two weeks ago. But Syriza will now have 145 seats in the 300-member parliament \u2013 just four fewer than when Tsipras took power in January. Its share of the vote is also less than one percentage point down on its 36.3% share in January, although turnout was put at a record low of 55.6%. What next for Syriza and Alexis Tsipras? Syriza officials said the party would seek to form a stable government immediately with the aim of maintaining confidence in the country. Its former coalition partner, the small anti-austerity rightwing Independent Greeks party, is ready to use its 10 seats to forge a power-sharing agreement with Syriza. Independent Greeks\u2019 leader, Panos Kammenos, joined Tsipras on stage to celebrate the result. Tsipras claimed the result gave him a mandate to govern and that he intended to serve a full term, promising relief for voters weary from five elections in six years. Does this change the bailout deal with the EU? No. Syriza campaigned on a pledge to implement the \u20ac86bn (\u00a363bn) bailout, while pledging measures to protect vulnerable groups from some of its effects. In exchange for the bailout funds, Tsipras agreed to deficit-reduction measures including tax rises, changes to pensions and social welfare cuts. Other aspects include labour market reform, liberalisation of consumer markets and fewer perks for civil servants. Tsipras\u2019s first task will be to persuade EU lenders that Greece has taken enough agreed steps to ensure the next payment. The bailout programme is up for review next month. Could the IMF decline to join the bailout? Yes. The International Monetary Fund has said it will refuse to take part in the bailout unless there is an \u201cexplicit and concrete\u201d agreement on debt relief for Greece. The IMF has argued that Greece cannot bear the full burden of the austerity programme and that its creditors should include debt relief in the package. Without a long moratorium on repayments, perhaps of 30 years, or a reduction in the value of the debt, the burden will become unmanageable, the IMF has argued. Will Greece need another bailout anyway? Greece might need another rescue. Tsipras hopes Syriza\u2019s electoral victory will give him renewed clout to negotiate debt relief and less onerous austerity measures from Greece\u2019s creditors. But that stance will not be popular with Germany or European institutions that imposed draconian measures on Greece in the name of fiscal discipline. If Tsipras is unable to extract significant concessions, the economy will remain weak, endangering deficit-reduction targets in the current deal and potentially requiring another bailout to head off a debt default. What do the markets think? Reaction in financial markets was muted on Monday morning. The euro was little changed while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index, which has gyrated in the past in reaction to Greek events, rose slightly. The yield on Greek two-year bonds fell a little, meaning traders think the risk of default is reduced. Simon Smith, chief economist at the currency trader FxPro, said: \u201cThe immediate impact has been minimal, the single currency opening little changed versus Friday\u2019s opening levels. In the wider picture, it\u2019s not going to make life any easier for the likes of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank and the negotiations surrounding debt sustainability over the coming months.\u201d",
