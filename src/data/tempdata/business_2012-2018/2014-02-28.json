    "webTitle": "Sweet smell of success at Serco as Rupert Soames takes helm", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You would have got very long odds against Rupert Soames becoming chief executive of Serco. He has been boss of Aggreko for 11 years; in that time the market capitalisation of the supplier of temporary power generators has risen almost tenfold to \u00a34.5bn, bringing FTSE 100 status and a sense of permanence at the top. He is 54. It seemed possible he would stay in post for another decade. Why does he want to leave? We should probably accept his explanation: chief executives have a half-life and can become toxic if they hang around too long. Fair point. But why Serco, a company whose market value is only half Aggreko's these days? That's harder to fathom but, from Serco's point of view, Soames is an excellent pick. For a start, he's a plain speaker who should make a clean break with the infuriating Christopher Hyman era in which Serco boasted about its superior \"values\" and its \"unique culture\" even while the scandals piled up. Soames tends to prefer self-deprecation \u2013 much smarter, especially when things go wrong. Yet the real question about Serco is whether the company is simply too big and too diverse for anybody to manage effectively. Serco may be half Aggreko's size in terms of stockmarket value but it is a vastly more complicated business. Serco has 120,000 employees and operates 700 contracts. The suspicion is that so many contracts went sour in quick succession (electronic tagging, prisoner escorting, GPs in Cornwall, etc) because it became impossible for senior management to know what was happening at the sharp end of operations. By contrast, Aggreko has only 6,000 staff and has succeeded in part by shifting its fleet of generators around the world with military precision. Homogeneity, in kit, contracts and processes, has tended to be the Aggreko way. Note, too, that Soames said in a 2010 interview with Management Today that he thought Aggreko could go to \"25,000-30,000 people without losing our culture, provided that we are really determined to work at it\". At Serco, he will be boss of four to five times that number and is inheriting somebody else's handiwork. It won't be a breeze. Still, he grew up at Arnold Weinstock's GEC, which employed 100,000 in the good old days. And at Serco, there is always the option of divestment if over-complexity is deemed a problem. An early judgment on Serco's size should be Soames' priority. Serco chairman Alastair Lyons deserves credit. Soames' appointment holds promise, as the 12% bounce in the share price suggests. \u2022 Pearson always looked to be facing a tricky 2014 but two profit warnings before the end of February make the point starkly. Okay, it's not strictly two warnings \u2013 call it one-and-a-half, with the main one relating to 2013 \u2013 but who's counting when the share price has fallen by a quarter since the start of the year? \"We are in the middle of what we believe will be a short, but difficult, transition,\" said chief executive John Fallon. It's certainly difficult. Pearson is in restructuring overdrive as it tries to keep pace with the print-to-digital revolution in school textbooks and college material, especially in the US, and books (where these days it owns 47% of Penguin Random House). At the same time, it is stepping up investment to meet curriculum changes. Meanwhile, trading conditions the North American market itself are described as the worst in a decade. In the counter-cyclical world of textbooks and educational software, a recovery in the US jobs market is unhelpful because more people choose to work than take a vocational course. How about a \"short\" transition? The theory sounds reasonable. After the two-year blitz to close excess warehouse space and accelerate the digital programme, restructuring charges should fall away again. Without them, Pearson would have reported record earnings last year, instead of a 2% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3382m. The worry, of course, is that the digital revolution turns out in practice to be never-ending. Pure print will soon be 40% of Pearson's business. Depending on your point of view, that's evidence of how much digitisation has been achieved, or how much is still left to go. Fallon is sufficiently confident to predict a return to growth in 2015 and is inviting believers to enjoy a 7% hike in the dividend to 48p. That's bold when set against the official forecast that earnings per share will fall to just 62p-67p this year. That dividend cover is thin. Fallon had better be correct that the storm will pass by the end of the year. \u2022 Who pays \u00a319m to raise \u00a360m? AO World, that's who. London's new poster-child for the online retailing mania \u2013 a shifter of fridges, freezes and microwaves \u2013 will soon be sent a bill by its financial advisers and underwriters that equates to more than twice its pre-tax profits last year of \u00a38.7m. AO's float prospectus shows how the City's money tree is once again in splendid bloom. The gross proceeds for AO from issuing 21m new shares at 285p were \u00a360m. Net proceeds will be \u00a340.9m. The difference is \"commissions, fees and expenses of the offer.\" The bankers' bonanza doesn't stop there. Selling shareholders, led by AO founder John Roberts, are not allowed to escape with a commission rate of, say, 0.5%, which an online stockbroker might charge. No, nothing less than 4% will do when you're listing on the London Stock Exchange with the help of Rothschild, JP Morgan Cazenove, Jefferies and Numis Securities. The sellers will hand over \u00a314.5m in commissions from their proceeds of \u00a3363m. Add a few more million quid in discretionary fees and commissions on so-called \"over-allotment\" shares (those that can be sold if demand is strong) and the City firms should collect a grand total of about \u00a335m from AO's listing. That will fill a few bonus stockings next Christmas. Naturally, the sums will be paid happily. AO, bafflingly, was priced at \u00a31.2bn at float and the bankers were overwhelmed with orders. Roberts probably won't resent his advisers' and promoters' cut of \u00a33.4m from his sale of \u00a386m-worth of shares. After all, he's now worth \u00a3500m-ish when one includes the shares he's kept. Investment fads come and go, and AO's pricing at 150-times earnings surely screams dotcom silliness once more. Nothing, though, is as permanent as investments bankers' princely fees. AO's fridges were full of champagne. All credit to RBS for ending teaser rates \"I know I am not the only banker using this sort of language,\" said Ross McEwan, new boss of Royal Bank of Scotland this week. \"But I assure you I am serious about making this language meaningful and delivering real change.\" He has to say that, of course, especially when he has just sent weariness with RBS to new depths by announcing an \u00a38bn loss for 2013. But let's give the Kiwi some credit for putting a few specific reforms on the table, such as an end to 0% \"teaser\" rates to capture credit card customers. \"Others can continue with this, but we will not be in the business of trapping people in debts they cannot afford,\" said McEwan. It's hard to know whether this policy will be good for RBS's profits in the short term. Never mind. McEwan's analysis of teaser rates is correct \u2013 and his rivals will have to follow or explain why they won't. Good move.",

In one internal e-mail in September 2011 he wrote he was not sure he could support a deal \"even if we received the branches etc at no cost.\" He later wrote of \"deep concern at the risks this transaction could pose\" and said it was \"abundantly clear\" that some senior co-op board members - including the disgraced former chairman of the bank, Paul Flowers - \"want to do this deal and seem to be 'deaf' to objective risk analysis.\"",

Headline inflation remained unchanged at 0.8%, confounding the consensus forecast for a small decline to 0.7%. </p> <p>Further falls in food and energy price inflation were offset by an unexpected increase in the core rate, from 0.8% to 1.0%. This, however, is unlikely to be sustained. Indeed, with the recovery still fragile and unemployment elevated (12.0%), albeit no longer rising, wage and underlying price pressures in the Eurozone are unlikely to start rising anytime soon. We expect core inflation to fall back again next month, also helped by favourable base effects (Easter fell in March last year). </p> <p>All this being said, the stable headline inflation reading coupled with the ongoing signs of economic recovery provide an argument for the ECB to keep their powder dry next week.

      "bodyText": "That concludes today\u2019s blog. Thanks for all the comments. Here\u2019s more on the US fourth-quarter GDP numbers, which were revised down and came in lower than forecasts. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, reckons the underlying trend is still sound: The US economy grew less than previously thought in the closing quarter of last year, but the details of the report suggest that investment is growing at an increased rate and underlying demand continued to expand at a reassuringly robust rate, given the headwinds during the closing months of 2013. Growth may slow further in the first quarter as adverse weather hit the economy, but survey data hint at ongoing underlying resilience which means the Fed is likely to be inclined to continue its taper... The economy, therefore, continued to grow at a reasonably robust rate, which was all the more impressive given the headwinds seen during the fourth quarter. Disruptions and uncertainty caused by the government shutdowns hit the economy in October, only to be followed by the onset of adverse weather in December... The Fed now seeks clarity on whether the recent soft patch of economic data merely represents a temporary set-back caused by the usually severe winter weather, or whether a more worrying fundamental slowdown in occurring. With share prices supported by low interest rates, here\u2019s zerohedge\u2019s take on the numbers: The revised figure for US GDP has just come out and it\u2019s lower than expected. The world\u2019s biggest economy expanded by 2.4% in the fourth quarter, the latest round of official figures showed. That\u2019s down from a first estimate of 3.2% a month ago and lower than the 2.5% expected by economists. And here\u2019s another retailer preparing its flotation. Reuters reports that Poundland has set its offer price range at 250p to 300p, implying a market value of between \u00a3625m and \u00a3750m. Private equity firm Warburg Pincus owns 76% of Poundland with the rest owned by management of the \u00a31-an-item chain. Pets at Home is the latest retailer to join the flotation rush. It\u2019s announced an expected price range of 210p to 260p a share for its share offer, valuing the company at between \u00a31.05bn and \u00a31.3bn. The top of the range is slightly higher than the price mooted when Pets at Home announced its intention to float last month. Britain\u2019s biggest pet retailer \u2013 with 369 stores, 246 vet surgeries and 116 in-store grooming salons \u2013 is mostly owned by private equity giant KKR. About 500 senior employees, from chief executive Nick Wood down to some store managers, own 10% of the company, putting them in line for a windfall of up to \u00a3130m. Retailers are lining up to list on the public markets to take advantage of booming stock markets and rising consumer confidence. Convenience store chain McColl\u2019s and online electricals seller AO both went to market this week. Eurozone inflation has come in slightly stronger than expected, which gives a small breather to European Central Bank president Mario Draghi ahead of next week\u2019s monetary policy meeting. However, inflation remains locked in what Draghi calls the \u201cdanger zone\u201d of less than 1%, suppressed by persistently high unemployment. The spectre of low inflation turning to deflation is what worries the market. Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING, remains wary: The higher-than-expected Eurozone \u201cflash\u201d inflation reading for February will reduce pressure on the ECB to ease monetary policy further next week. Headline inflation remained unchanged at 0.8%, confounding the consensus forecast for a small decline to 0.7%. Further falls in food and energy price inflation were offset by an unexpected increase in the core rate, from 0.8% to 1.0%. This, however, is unlikely to be sustained. Indeed, with the recovery still fragile and unemployment elevated (12.0%), albeit no longer rising, wage and underlying price pressures in the Eurozone are unlikely to start rising anytime soon. We expect core inflation to fall back again next month, also helped by favourable base effects (Easter fell in March last year). All this being said, the stable headline inflation reading coupled with the ongoing signs of economic recovery provide an argument for the ECB to keep their powder dry next week. To be sure, if the ECB decides to ease policy anyway, it will probably merely consist of a small refi-rate cut; the deposit rate would likely stay at zero. Beneath the headline 12.0% figure for eurozone unemployment, grim as it is, are shocking figures on joblessness among the young. In Greece, 59% of under-25s are out of work and in Spain the figure is 54.6%. The total European figure is 23.4% and in the UK it\u2019s 20%. The disproportionate impact of the economic crisis on the young has raised fears of a lost generation kept out of the labour force in their formative adult years. The tweet below has a full table: Mt.Gox, once the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy, according to reports. Here\u2019s a Reuters snap: MT GOX MAY HAVE LOST AS MUCH AS 2.8BLN YEN CASH DUE TO IMPROPER ACCESS TO ITS SYSTEM-MT GOX LAWYER Eurozone unemployment stayed at 12.0% for the fourth month running while inflation remained steady at 0.8%. Economists had expected unemployment to remain unchanged but for inflation to be lower at 0.7%. The euro has hit its highest level against the dollar this year on the news, which takes some pressure off the European Central Bank. The ECB has been trying to damp fears about possible deflation in the eurozone. More to follow. Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways\u2019 parent IAG, has added his voice to the business debate on Scottish Independence. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cIf anything, it [independence] will be slightly positive since we believe it will abolish air passenger duty.\u201d The pro-independence campaign has argued that Scotland can attract more tourists by scrapping or reducing air passenger duty to compete with rival European destinations. After Standard Life said yesterday it was drawing up contingency plans for a move to London from Edinburgh if Scotland leaves the UK, all business leaders need to be ready for this question ahead of September\u2019s vote. Twitter is aglow with pro-independence people complaining that Walsh\u2019s comments won\u2019t get the attention they merit. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is a panellist at a Bundesbank symposium in Frankfurt, which starts at 1.30pm UK time. The Bank isn\u2019t releasing any text of what Carney will say but we\u2019ll keep an eye out on the wires. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s resident free thinker, is also on a panel this morning. He\u2019s discussing the 70th anniversary of Bretton Woods in Austria. We\u2019ll post an update on anything interesting. Ahead of the eurozone unemployment figures there\u2019s some good news on jobs from Ireland. Our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald writes: More than 60,000 new jobs were created in the Irish Republic in 2013 according to figures released in Dublin today. Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office has revealed that 61,000 people went back into work as well as 54,000 part-time posts. In Greater Dublin the unemployment rate has now fallen to 10% with the overall jobless total in the state falling to 12.1%. At the height of the recession in Ireland in 2011 unemployment soared to 15% of the workforce. The CSO said unemployment over 2013 had fallen in every region of the Republic bar one. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said: \u201cWe can afford at this stage to be far more confident about our prospects than at any time since the crisis began.\u201d City of London police have joined Spanish counterparts for multiple raids on \u201cboiler room\u201d scammers that prey on British people to sell them dud shares. A total of 110 people have been held after arrests in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella and London. The raids were the fruits of a two-year effort to target the scammers, who exert extreme pressure over the phone to get people, often pensioners, to part with their money for worthless or non-existent shares. The tactics are similar to those shown in the hit film The Wolf of Wall Street. There were further arrests in the US and Serbia. Most of those arrested were British. Cars including an Aston Martin and a Ferrari were seized along with various luxury items. Here\u2019s City of London police commander Steve Head, via the Press Association: What we\u2019ve seen today is the culmination of a two-year investigation that has been worldwide in its nature. What we\u2019ve seen is an unprecedented level of co-operation. We expect this network alone to have upwards of 1,000 victims. We\u2019ve seen millions of pounds taken from people. You see real victims in real communities whose lives have been devastated. Savings that they thought they could rely on in their old age have gone in a heartbeat. The fraudsters don\u2019t seem to have kept a low profile. Take a look at these customised shoes, as shown on the City of London police Twitter feed: Serco, the embattled outsourcing company, has found a new chief executive in the shape of Rupert Soames. He\u2019s joining in June from Aggreko, where he\u2019s been the CEO for 11 years. Serco has been looking for a new boss since Chris Hyman quit in October. The company\u2019s reputation has been battered since July when the government accused it and rival outsourcer G4S of charging to electronically tag offenders who were in fact dead or in prison. After being barred from new government contracts, Serco is now back in the running after presenting a clean-up plan but a profit warning last month admitted it still had work to do to regain favour with the government, its biggest client. Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, was educated at Eton and is the brother of Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames. With those sort of connections, no wonder Alastair Lyons, Serco\u2019s chairman, was keen to stress his new man\u2019s credentials: Rupert is a passionate believer in public services, highly respected by customers, governments, employees and investors, and I am absolutely delighted that he has chosen to join Serco and lead the company\u2019s future development. Serco investors are happy. Its shares are up more than 10%. Aggreko shares fell 9% early on and are now down 3.8%. The Chinese yuan is heading for its biggest daily and weekly fall on record after the central bank stepped in to weaken the currency. The Chinese central bank has intervened recently to stamp out speculative trading on continuing yuan gains by setting weak daily fixings and asking its agent banks to buy dollars. Here are excerpts from Reuters\u2019 report: Its intervention reached a frenzied pitch on Friday with the onshore yuan falling by its daily 1% limit against a midpoint fixing for the first time since July 2012. Stepped-up efforts by the People\u2019s Bank of China to actively weaken the currency has led the yuan to a dramatic weakening cycle that many analysts believe may be a prelude to more foreign exchange market reforms including widening a daily trading band at an annual parliamentary meeting next week. The Chinese yuan has firmed every year against the dollar since 2010 with recent gains coming amid very little volatility and despite widespread weakness among emerging market currencies, fuelling growth of speculative capital flows. Those hot-money inflows -- UBS estimates that amount at more than $150 billion in 2013 -- have complicated the task of the central bank\u2019s policy management as it seeks to curb the growth of shadow banking activities. The yuan\u2019s dramatic fall since last week is aimed at stamping out those speculative plays. \u2018Have you changed your expection of the yuan to depreciation? If not, I suggest changing it as soon as possible. I have changed mine and think it will stay weak for the next three months,\u2019 said a trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai. You can read more in this article by zerohedge, as recommended on Twitter: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The big economic news of the morning will be the eurozone unemployment and inflation figures. The jobless rate stayed at 12% in January for the third month running as expected but inflation fell. That increased fears of deflation, creating a dilemma for the European Central Bank. Weaker than expected German inflation, reported yesterday, did not bode well for February\u2019s figures, which are due at 10am UK time. But retail sales in the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy rose at their fastest for seven years, official numbers showed this morning. A European Commission survey yesterday showed economic sentiment rose slightly in February but inflation expectations fell. Mario Draghi, the European Bank\u2019s president, said yesterday evening that the eurozone wasn\u2019t experiencing deflation and that inflation expectations for the region were in line with the ECB\u2019s aim of keeping inflation close to 2%. Attention will switch across the Atlantic after lunch when the latest reading of US GDP figures are announced for the fourth quarter. Economists expect the government to cut its estimate of annualised fourth-quarter growth to 2.5% from 3.2% according to a Reuters poll. The figures are often revised as more information comes in.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of British Airways has said he expects hundreds of thousands of people to drive from England to Scotland to avoid air passenger duty (APD) if Scotland become independent. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA-owner International Airlines Group (IAG), said he expected people to drive from the north of England to Scottish airports to avoid APD, which will cost UK passengers up to \u00a3388 from April. The Scottish government has promised to prioritise a 50% reduction in APD, with a view to eventual abolition if it wins the independence referendum in September. Walsh said people will \"just drive across the border to avoid\" APD in the UK. He said those in the north of England would be most likely to drive across the border to avoid the charge. \"If there is an independent government in Scotland they have made clear they will abolish it [APD] \u2013 which is damaging the economy \u2013 people will move away from the north of England airports,\" he said. \"Newcastle will suffer to airports like Edinburgh.\" Asked whether it might be quite a long drive to avoid the charge, which will range from \u00a313 a passenger for short-haul economy flights to \u00a3388 for long-haul premium tickets, Walsh said: \"You'd be surprised what people will do to avoid it.

But he said it was unlikely the airline would introduce new long haul routes from Scottish airports. He said overall independence would probably be a \"positive development\" for the company's business. Walsh's fillip for first minister Alex Salmond's campaign was tempered when the industrial body Scottish Engineering warned that its members had \"major concerns\" about the risks over a post-independence currency, tax rates, cross-border transaction costs and EU membership. Its chief executive, Brian Buchan, said it was helping companies make contingency plans for independence because the Scottish government had failed to address their anxieties. Buchan said he was not aware of anything as dramatic as Standard Life's disclosure on Thursday that it was setting up English companies as a contingency because of worries about currency, regulation and taxation.

Are we going to have some sort of ad hoc relationship with the pound? \"Of even more concern is what would happen with the rest of Europe: will we have EU membership and will we have free access to these markets.\" The status of APD has been the focus of repeated tussles in the debate over Scotland's constitutional future, since the duty could be cut or abolished in Scotland if more powers were devolved to the Holyrood parliament while remaining in the UK. With APD rates for long-haul flights devolved to Northern Ireland and set at 0% to help the Stormont government compete with Irish airports, Salmond's government began pressing for APD to be devolved to Holyrood before the independence referendum. Despite being opposed by the Scottish Green party, the Scottish National party's junior partner in the independence campaign, Salmond's government has made phasing out of APD one of its main offers to Scottish voters. The policy is backed by the chief executives at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. Keith Brown, the Scottish transport minister, said only independence would give Scotland the power to control APD. He added: \"Mr Walsh's comments further underline the UK government's duty to engage properly with the issues of the independence debate. \"Instead, the self-styled project fear [the no campaign] are intent on wasting time engaging in their 'dambuster' strategy of scaremongering and attempting to bully people in Scotland to vote no.\"",
