      "bodyText": "G4S officials and local contractors have admitted to MPs that more than half the houses accommodating asylum seekers in Middlesbrough and Stockton were painted red \u2013 but insisted it had not been done deliberately. The Home Office last week launched an investigation after asylum seekers claimed their distinctive accommodation was making them targets for abuse from racists and vandals. The doors of the houses are now starting to be repainted. James Momoh, 40, from Liberia, told the Guardian workers had come to paint his door grey in Middlesbrough on Monday, along with all the other red doors in the area. He complained last week that his door made him a target, claiming that eggs had been thrown at it and that a man tried to force his way in with a knife. Peter Neden and John Whitwam of G4S \u2013 the company contracted by the Home Office to accommodate asylum seekers \u2013 and Stuart Monk, of the local subcontractor Jomast, appeared before the Commons home affairs committee on Tuesday to discuss the controversy. Whitwam told MPs that of the 298 homes in Middlesbrough accommodating asylum seekers, 175 \u2013 or 59% \u2013 had red doors, as did 53% of homes for asylum seekers in Stockton, which he conceded \u201cwas too high\u201d. But the G4S bosses repeatedly denied they were aware of any complaints from asylum seekers prior to the story that gained much media coverage last week. Keith Vaz, the chair of the home affairs select committee, told G4S and Jomast representatives about the case of Ahmad Zubair, a former tenant and asylum seeker. \u201cHe was suffering abuse because the door of his house was red and the door of other asylum seekers was also red,\u201d said Vaz. \u201cHe then went with a pot of paint and he painted his door white because he was fed up of having people abusing him because they identified the property as being the property of an asylum seeker.\u201d \u201cYour officers then went round and repainted the front door red. That\u2019s not acceptable behaviour, is it?\u201d Vaz pressed the company leaders. Neden, regional president at G4S, said repeatedly: \u201cIf we had known then what he had known now, we would have taken action sooner.\u201d Whitwam told the committee the issue of the doors had been looked into on two previous occasions, in 2012 when Suzanne Fletcher, a former local councillor, raised it and then again in 2014. \u201cTwice we have looked to see whether or not there\u2019s any indication that an asylum seeker has raised this as an issue and we found that they haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have yet to find any linkage between the colour of door or any other identifying feature of any of the properties and intimidation.\u201d He said the police had confirmed this also, but G4S has now decided to repaint the doors as a \u201cprecaution\u201d so there was no one predominant colour. When challenged about the ways available for asylum seekers to complain about the service, Whitwam said a freephone number was available, yet MPs had apparently been told the 0800 number had cost \u201c\u00a31 a time\u201d before the communications regulator Ofcom intervened. The door repainting would take a couple of weeks to complete, said Monk, the owner of Jomast. He said the issue of the red doors was \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d, adding: \u201cI do think a lot has been made of it because we haven\u2019t had any reported incidents at all.\u201d Monk told the committee the doors were painted red \u201cprobably 20 years ago\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably owned those properties over 20 years and before the advent of asylum accommodation in actual fact,\u201d he said, insisting there was no deliberate decision to paint the properties of asylum seekers red. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had an exemplary record in terms of the provision of the services from the start of our contract.\u201d Monk rejected the assertion put to him by the panel that he was \u201cprofiting from deprivation and people\u2019s need for refuge\u201d. Neden told the panel of MPs there were not enough houses available to accommodate and said 322 asylum seekers had been put up in hotels, typically of two- or three-star standard. He added that the number of asylum seekers the company was tasked to house had almost doubled in just three years from 9,000 to 17,000. Vaz said at the end of the session he had found Monk\u2019s evidence \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d. The senior Labour MP asked each boss whether their front doors were painted red, to which they all replied that this was not the case. Speaking on the issue, Prof Thom Brooks, an immigration specialist at Durham University, said the solution in Middlesbrough was not merely painting doors, and the town needed extra funding to deal with having more than the official 1:200 guideline ratio of asylum seekers to residents. He said: \u201cI have seen nothing to say that there will be extra funding for the community to account for that. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of saying those people they already have should be moved \u2013 they have already been through enough turmoil in their lives \u2013 but there should be extra money to manage the impact,\u201d Brooks said.",

    "webTitle": "Anger as government blocks TTIP legal documents relating to health service", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The controversial trade deal between Europe and the US has come under further fire after campaigners accused the government of blocking access to legal advice that shows its impact on the health service. Campaigners warned on Tuesday that the legal documents could reveal the extent to which private health companies can sue the government using a secret tribunal system if a Whitehall policy change were to hit their profits. As part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), businesses can sue governments or public sector bodies for any loss of profits. The TTIP is an attempt by the US and EU to renegotiate thousands of trade tariffs and reduce the regulatory burden on exporters. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said in answer to a freedom of information request that disclosing the legal documents would make civil servants cautious when they \u201cneed space in which to seek candid advice from their lawyers\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are less likely to seek such advice if there is an expectation that it will subsequently be disclosable.\u201d But Global Justice Now, which has campaigned for greater transparency in trade negotiations, said the decision would fuel concerns that NHS trusts could come under attack from private contractors using the ISDS (investor state dispute settlement) tribunal system. Nick Dearden, the charity\u2019s director, said: \u201cIf this trade deal is supposed to benefit all of us, why has it been so secretive? The documents we have seen so far have mostly come from Wikileaks or after intense pressure from campaign groups. \u201cAfter this move by the business secretary, the suspicion must be that it is a power grab by large companies keen to sweep away trade barriers and that the NHS is among the most vulnerable,\u201d he said. The EU Commission has denied shutting out stakeholders from the debate, arguing that it conducts regular meetings with interested groups and MEPs in the EU parliament. Critics have accused Brussels of conducting secret negotiations covering food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and a separate tribunal system that allows businesses to bypass the civil courts. Last year, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner for trade, proposed scrapping ISDS in favour of an international courts system after protests from several European governments. A report by the business, innovation and skills select committee in the last parliament argued that ISDS was unnecessary and business disputes related to TTIP should be conducted through the existing legal systems of each nation. It said the government must be allowed to expand the NHS without facing a legal challenge, and Brussels needed stronger evidence to back up its claim that the deal would bring a boost of \u00a3100bn a year to the UK. It is understood that Barack Obama\u2019s negotiating team has rejected Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s reform proposal ahead of talks next month. But last week a Canadian newspaper reported that the EU had approached the new administration in Ottawa to revise a trade deal between the EU and Canada (CETA) that will be presented to the EU parliament for ratification in mid 2016, with a view to the deal becoming law in early 2017. Brussels wanted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to strip out the ISDS tribunal and replace it with the new international courts system, putting pressure on the US to follow suit.",

      "bodyText": "Travel operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all British bookings to Tunisia until November following a wave of violent protests across the country. The Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the north African country, which is experiencing its worst social unrest since the 2011 revolution and the tour company said that as a result it had taken the decision \u201cto cancel all bookings to Tunisia up to and including 31 October 2016\u201d. It added that customers would be contacted individually and said: \u201cWe appreciate that this may be frustrating for our customers who have been looking forward to their holiday.\u201d The Thomas Cook cancellations came as easyJet announced a decline in revenues per seat following the terrorist attacks on Paris and the suspected bombing of a passenger plane over Egypt. The two announcements underline the problems facing sections of the tourism industry as tourists steer clear of destinations hit by political turmoil and terror attacks. In the latest sign of Tunisia\u2019s economic and social woes, Hundreds of police staged a protest on Monday outside the country\u2019s presidential palace to demand a pay rise. Reporting on its last three months, the budget airline said its revenues per seat were strong in October but fell sharply \u2013 by \u201chigh single digit\u201d percentages \u2013 in November and December as easyJet cut prices in a bid to attract customers. The coordinated murder of 130 people in Paris on 13 November accounted for about two percentage points of that fall in revenue per seat. The halting of flights after 224 people were killed in the downing of a Russian flight from Egypt on 31 October, which Russia claims was caused by a terrorist bomb, caused another 1.5 percentage point fall, EasyJet said. Though revenues per seat improved in January, they were still lower than before the terrorist attacks. The airline\u2019s shares, down 10% since the Paris attacks, fell 3% to \u00a315.79 and were the biggest losers in the FTSE 100 index. In response, easyJet has been cutting costs, although pressure on revenues has been offset by falling fuel prices. EasyJet said that if fuel prices remain stable it will save \u00a3165m-\u00a3180m this year although exchange rate changes would cost around \u00a350m. The airline said further cost controls would keep it in line for record pre-tax profit of \u00a3738m for the year ending in September. Other incidents last year that caused trouble for travel companies also included the deliberate crashing of a Germanwings passenger plane by its co-pilot and the killing of 38 holidaymakers in Tunisia. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said in November the industry faced the greatest turmoil he had seen in the past 30 years. EasyJet, which is the second-biggest airline in France, said in November that business to and from the country had fallen and that some customers were choosing not to show up for flights. James Hollins, analyst at Nomura, said: \u201cThe French and Egyptian issues have had a more damaging impact on fares than we had expected\u201d, but added that they were likely to by \u201crelatively exceptional and short-term issues\u201d. The number of passengers carried by asyJet rose 8.1% to 16.1 million in the three months to the end of December, mainly because of increased capacity. The company said it was not planning job cuts to control costs and that its employee numbers were growing.",

The new-ish Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) could not have hoped for a plainer case of chiselling, devious and code-breaking behaviour by a supermarket. Try this internal Tesco email, detailing methods for buyers to meet financial targets: \u201cNot paying back money owed.\u201d This was an open and shut case. It\u2019s not hard to see how the rot set in. As Dave Lewis, the new-broom chief executive recruited after the \u00a3263m profits overstatement in 2014 (the subject of a separate investigation by the Serious Fraud Office) put it: \u201cThe absolute focus on operating margin had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers.\u201d Lewis seems to have caught the whiff of something nasty about two minutes after arriving at Tesco towers: making peace with suppliers was one of his first reforms. Had nobody on the Tesco board at the time thought that relationships with suppliers was a fit subject for self-investigation? It\u2019s not the GCA\u2019s job to attribute blame to individuals in its investigations \u2013 it seeks to establish whether its code on fair behaviour was broken. And Lewis, understandably, preferred to concentrate on his clean-up operation. The rest of us, though, will wonder what on earth the responsible non-executive directors were doing. The annual report of 2014 \u2013 covering part of the period at the heart of the GCA report \u2013 showed Tesco failing to meet its own target for harmonious relations with suppliers. Only 67% agreed to the statement \u201cI am treated with respect\u201d, down from 71% the previous year, which itself missed the internal ambition. There were warning signs. The same annual report said Tesco had the mechanics in place to ensure it obeyed the groceries code and paid invoices on time. It had a code compliance officer who reported to the audit committee, which declared it had \u201ceffective oversight of our compliance with the code\u201d. That, it turns out, was tosh. Ken Hanna was chairman of the audit committee for much of the period investigated by the GCA, and another leading light was Patrick Cescau, also Tesco\u2019s senior independent director. Both spent their executive lives at big suppliers \u2013 Cadbury Schweppes and Unilever, respectively \u2013 so could hardly plead that the rough and tumble of the grocery trade was unfamiliar territory. What went wrong, chaps? Tesco shareholders, sadly, will never get the chance to ask them the question at an annual meeting. Hanna and Cescau departed last year \u2013 with thanks from the chairman for their valuable contributions, naturally. Bailey candid on FCA role Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, doesn\u2019t sound overly pleased to be shuffled off to east London to lead the Financial Conduct Authority. He had to be cajoled into applying by George Osborne and couldn\u2019t manage a \u201cdelighted\u201d in his public acceptance. Instead, Bailey gave a refreshingly candid insight into why he said yes. \u201cRecent developments have shown that the most pressing issue in the system right now is the need for stable leadership at the FCA ... After a lot of thought I have decided to move and do all that I can do make the FCA effective and successful.\u201d That the FCA is viewed as ineffective and unsuccessful, and requires stable leadership, is barely worth debating. The organisation has had its triumphs, such as curbs on payday lenders, but its standing never recovered from a cack-handed briefing to a newspaper over an inquiry into old insurance policies in 2014. Share prices crashed as the FCA waited six hours to clarify the limited scope of its probe. The episode looked like old fashioned incompetence and its former chief executive Martin Wheatley, never popular with the banks, handed his many enemies a stick with which to beat him. Bailey is a safer pair of hands. His PRA has waded through the thicket of post-crisis regulation \u2013 capital buffers, resolution regimes and ringfencing \u2013 robustly. But there are at least two questions around this appointment. First, it is depressing that the pool of regulatory talent is apparently so shallow in the UK that the boss of the PRA has had to leave a job he was doing well for an effective demotion. It\u2019s not as if Bailey has experience in the FCA\u2019s territory of enforcement and competition matters. The second concern is that the arrival of a Bank man won\u2019t quell the worry that the FCA lacks independence and can be pushed around by the Treasury. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of Treasury select committee, wants his crew to have a veto on senior appointments and dismissals at the FCA, as happens with the Office for Budget Responsibility. That is a sensible safeguard that Osborne should grant.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s first new nuclear power plants for decades face fresh delays amid reports that French energy giant EDF is unsure it can finance the \u00a318bn project. Directors were expected to meet this week to sign off on a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A final decision has been on the cards since October, when China\u2019s state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the premier, Xi Jinping. But executives at state-owned EDF, which owns the rest of the project, have delayed a final decision amid funding problems, according to French financial journal Les Echos. It said EDF was putting pressure on the French government to help find new backers to come on board alongside CGN. While directors are due to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, Les Echos reported, no decision will be made until the next board meeting, which will happen before final results are released on 15 February. EDF did not return requests for comment. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, while the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF \u00a392.50 per unit of electricity, around double the market rate. A group of its own employee-shareholders have also urged EDF to ditch the Hinkley plan, saying it could put the company\u2019s survival at risk. Green campaigners said any fresh delay unmasked multiple flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. \u201cThe EDF board is clearly rattled as they delay yet again this crucial investment decision,\u201d said Greenpeace executive director John Sauven, adding that the delay \u201ccould well signal curtains for Hinkley\u201d. \u201cEDF managers as well as employee representatives on the board are deeply concerned this project is too risky and too expensive,\u201d Sauven added. \u201cGeorge Osborne is almost alone in defending Hinkley\u2019s honour.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Former employees of collapsed yacht builder Fairline Boats are \u201cqueuing at the gates\u201d for jobs under its new Russian owners but only 100 positions will be available, according to its managing director. Alexander Volov and Igor Glyanenko, low-profile UK-based businessmen with a background in media, have bought Fairline\u2019s assets in a deal understood to be worth \u00a34m. The takeover ensures the Northamptonshire-based yacht maker, founded in 1963, will continue to exist in some form. But the new managing director, Russell Currie, said the firm, renamed Fairline Yachts, would only need 100 people, compared with the previous workforce of 446. Currie said the new company would be \u201chugely more efficient\u201d than its previous incarnation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make profit and stay in business,\u201d he said. The firm will close a base in Corby and has also ditched a testing site in Ipswich, opting to use the local marina instead. While 72 of the 446 employees were kept on during administration to allow Fairline to keep making and selling boats, that skeleton workforce has now also been made redundant. That leaves more than four people fighting it out for every job on offer with Fairline Yachts, not including applicants who did not work there before. Currie, who has been a Fairline dealer since 1998, said former staff had been \u201cqueuing at the gates with their CVs\u201d. While the slimmed-down operation would need fewer staff initially, Currie was bullish about Fairline\u2019s prospects for growth. He said new orders had already come in since Volov and Glyanenko completed a deal for Fairline\u2019s assets on Monday. \u201cWith the orders that we have now, we\u2019ll be building 30-40 in the first year, 50 in the second and 50 to 100 from there,\u201d said Currie. He added that the company would fulfil all existing orders for boats, \u201cno matter what it costs us\u201d. Volov and Glyanenko are both shareholders in the media technology business Megahertz, but have little background in the boating industry. Sources close to Fairline said both men were \u201cpassionate about boats\u201d and had been looking for a shipyard to buy for some time. Fairline went into administration shortly before Christmas, just months after it was sold by Jon Moulton\u2019s private equity house Better Capital to fellow buyout house Wessex Bristol. Wessex Bristol, run by businessman Ayiaz Ahmed, was criticised by union officials, who claimed some staff were not paid in the run-up to its demise. The trade union Unite yesterday said it was seeking a meeting with Fairline\u2019s management to ascertain how many former staff would get jobs with the new business. \u201cWe believe that Fairline Boats is a high-premium brand with a dedicated, long-serving workforce with a viable future,\u201d said Unite regional officer Mick Orpin.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016. The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year. In a message that will cheer motorists and countries that import oil, it added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 (\u00a326) a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October. Only two yeas ago, oil was trading at above $115 a barrel and petrol pump prices were more than 130p a litre. In recent weeks the price of Brent crude has sunk below $30 a barrel and supermarket petrol prices have dipped below \u00a31 a litre. John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the World Bank\u2019s commodities markets outlook, said: \u201cLow prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time. While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u201d Brent crude rose almost 5% to touch $32 a barrel, reversing earlier falls after both Opec and non-Opec producers responded by saying they would adopt further measures to tackle oversupply. The FTSE 100 in London ended 0.6% higher at 5,911 points, while Frankfurt and Paris both added about 1%, shrugging off a 6.4% fall in Shanghai that took the leading Chinese stock market to its lowest close since December 2014. New York continued the recovery to register an early 298-point gain by 5.30pm GMT. The World Bank\u2019s intervention follows a forecast by the International Energy Agency that contributed to panic selling last week and a collapse in the price of Brent crude to $27 a barrel. The report said prices could fall further as new Iranian output cancels out production cuts elsewhere, leading to third successive year when supply exceeded demand by 1m barrels a day. Officials at the bank played down the likelihood of a crash, though they warned in a separate report that a synchronised slowdown in the biggest emerging markets could be intensified by a fresh bout of financial turmoil, tipping the world economy into recession. Oil prices began to tumble during the summer of 2014 in response to a slowdown in China\u2019s factory output. The country\u2019s manufacturing industry, which in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash has become the world\u2019s largest single destination for oil and metals, stopped buying commodities at the previous high levels. Investors expected the major oil producers to cut production in response to falling demand, but instead the Saudi-led Opec nations, Russia, and the US oil fracking firms have until recently maintained the flow of crude into world markets. The World Bank, which is a major lender to developing nations, said the market had reached a turning point and the \u201cfundamental drivers of oil demand and supply\u201d are \u201clikely to partly reverse\u201d. It argued that prices would stabilise below $40 for the rest of the year as high-cost oil producers make production cuts \u201cthat are likely to outweigh any additional capacity coming to the market\u201d. A modest pickup in global growth would also prevent a further slump. Beyond oil markets, the prices for commodities are expected to be weighed down by a plentiful supply of food and metals amid slowing demand in emerging market economies. In all, prices for 37 of the 46 commodities monitored by the World Bank were revised lower for the year. \u201cEmerging market economies have been the main sources of commodity demand growth since 2000. As a result, weakening growth prospects in these economies are weighing on commodity prices. A further slowdown in major emerging markets would reduce trading partner growth and global commodity demand,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Volatile days are becoming the norm but even by those standards, the swings during the course of the day\u2019s trading were pretty notable. A 6% slump in Chinese markets - partly driven by poor rail freight figures casting new doubt on the strength of the country\u2019s economy - got things off to a bad start. Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening. So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u2019s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound. Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says: In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets. There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular. Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs. This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not. Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending. The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation. However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u2013 even at a low level \u2013 should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services. On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated. The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said: As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel. At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u2018sell\u2019 button once again. Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume. More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Unionists representing Greece\u2019s 35,000-strong nurses\u2019 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u2019s draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. The country\u2019s union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls. Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: \u201cWithout any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget.\u201d \u201cThe funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn\u2019t listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon.\u201d Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as \u20ac25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than \u20ac5.7bn. Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece. \u201cIt is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government,\u201d Travalas added. \u201cWe are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through.\u201d More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. January\u2019s consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December. Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said: Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer\u2019s wallets with a much needed fillip. There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year. The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports: The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016. The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year. It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October. \u201cLow prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time,\u201d said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank\u2019s commodities markets outlook. \u201cWhile we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u201d Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel. Here is our full story: More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake. The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for the purchasing managers business activity index came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said: U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse: The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy. A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit. The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months. On what has been a volatile day for markets so far, Wall Street has started off on the front foot ahead of results from Apple and as the Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. With oil recovering from its early falls - Brent crude is now up 1.6% at $30.99 a barrel having fallen as low as $29.27 - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 133 points or 0.8% in early trading. In Europe the FTSE 100 is 0.15% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have edged into positive territory despite the earlier 6% slump on the Chinese market. Britain\u2019s economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. Haldane said in an interview with Wolverhampton\u2019s Express and Star newspaper: We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,. I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It\u2019s true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing. These days China is of such a size and it\u2019s sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold. Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that. Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today. Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight \u201csenior decision makers\u201d joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will \u201cwork to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics.\u201d A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion. Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the \u2018invisible deficit\u2019, as the financial markets have been relaxed about it. But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That\u2019s what Mark Carney means when he mentions the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d. A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete. But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn\u2019t have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis. So if international investors decide not to buy UK assets, or hold the pound, if Britain\u2019s EU membership is in doubt, there could be a problem..... A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England\u2019s appearance at parliament: 1) Mark Carney warned that Britain\u2019s current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. He warned that: First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u2019s what is the case when you\u2019re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney also agreed that \u201cmaterial decisions\u201d can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. The governor\u2019s five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. I guess this is a new form of forward guidance.... If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF\u2019s top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble. 4) Carney said there is \u201cno concern\u201d at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks. He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the oil prices isn\u2019t what it was (as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us) 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema. Hopefully The Big Short won\u2019t give him any flashbacks Stock markets have recovered some of their early losses. The FTSE 100 is now down just 28 points, or 0.5%, having been down almost 100 points earlier. On a lighter note, Wes Streeting then asks Mark Carney if he\u2019s seen The Big Short, the new film of Michael Lewis\u2019s excellent book about the US sub-prime crash that almost brought down Wall Street. I feel like I lived it, Carney replies [he was running the Bank of Canada at the time] I haven\u2019t seen it, but I\u2019m sure I will. I\u2019m happy to go. The question was prompted by Paul Waugh of the Huffington Post: A bottle of wine for any reader who spots the Carneys at their local Odeon. Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy? We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?] But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don\u2019t think that is the prospect. Labour MP Wes Streeting asks Carney whether the Treasury has ever leant on him over banking regulations. No, and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference if it tried, Carney replies. Q: And is the bank worried about recent elections in Spain and Portugal, given the relative instability of the governments which arose? Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case. Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain\u2019s current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU. Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk? Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel). But he won\u2019t say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons: \u201cFirst, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u2019s what is the case when you\u2019re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney didn\u2019t define \u2018certain developments\u2019, but it\u2019s pretty clear what he meant. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, warned yesterday that investors would probably demand a considerably higher risk premium to hold UK assets if the public voted to leave the EU. John Mann MP demands to know whether Carney had any role in the decision to abandon Britain\u2019s review of banking culture. This decision was taken entirely by the FCA, Carney replies. We have nothing to apologise for regarding our handling of UK bank culture, Carney continues, adding that the BoE isn\u2019t yet satisfied with bank\u2019s responses to questions about their conduct. Mark Carney is asked whether Britain would face financial instability if it votes to leave the EU. The governor says the Bank will reveal its precautionary measures \u2018after the fact\u2019. Speaking carefully (to avoid saying anything too controversial) he adds that material decisions can have an impact on financial stability, but doesn\u2019t give a particular view on Brexit. Carney also denies that central bankers hope the oil price goes up, to push inflation higher. Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price? Mark Carney says that OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas). But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point. Back in the committee room, Mark Carney has been fielding questions about market turbulence, and the oil price. We are in an environment of \u201cheightened risk aversion\u201d which could continue for some time, says the BoE governor. And that will effect currencies that are seen as safe (the US dollar, the Swiss franc), and those that are riskier (emerging market currencies). Authorities need to bear this in mind. Here\u2019s a piece of idle speculation..... If Mark Carney does change his mind and serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021. That\u2019s also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016. When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics. The prime minister-ship is now in Justin Trudeau\u2019s youthful hands, and could stay there for some time. Having run two central banks (UK and Canada), and also chaired the Financial Stability Board, Carney would be well-qualified to run the International Monetary Fund. It would also break the European hold on the top job at the IMF, without giving it to an American. Looking away from the select committee.... Tesco has been ordered to improve the way it deals with suppliers. An official inquiry into the 2014 scandal around Tesco\u2019s financial results found that the supermarket has delayed payments to suppliers, to support its profits. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator, was damning about Tesco\u2019s behaviour, saying: \u201cI was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction: Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders \u2018bailed in\u2019 to cover the costs of a rescue. Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? Carney says several things need to happen. 1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their \u2018bail-in-able debt\u2019 is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure. 2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn\u2019t want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders. 3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems. The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the \u2018ring-fenced\u2019, systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that\u2019s the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout. Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves? Carney says he\u2019s met with many bank chiefs recently (including, I suspect, at Davos), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need. He argues that there\u2019s very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That\u2019s more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy. Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks. Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it\u2019s not time to raise interest rates? I wouldn\u2019t clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies. Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)? All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported) Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)? It wasn\u2019t - MPC speeches aren\u2019t typically shared with the FPC beforehand. Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December? Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies. And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues. Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks? The governor says that it was not the fundamental cause, but it did contribute to it. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, then asks Mark Carney if he is reconsidering his decision to only serve five years at the Bank of England. Could he now decide to serve the full eight years? Carney smiles, then replies that he\u2019s certainly not planning to leave and follow Andrew Bailey to the FCA. We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there\u2019s more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I\u2019d probably have to do so by the end of this. Carney is half-way through his five-year term. Tyrie says it would be valuable to know as soon as possible whether Carney might change his mind, and seek a longer stint at the Bank of England. The session begins with Mark Carney paying tribute to Andrew Bailey\u2019s career at the Bank of England. It will probably take three to six months to appoint a new deputy governor to replace Bailey. There is no designated successor, Carney adds. So get your application ready, readers Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is about to start taking questions from the Treasury Committee. The session is being streamed live here. Looking back at the markets quickly... the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red, down 64 points or 1% at 5812. Oil is recovering some of its early losses, but it\u2019s still down around 2% at $29.91 per barrel. George Osborne has really surprised the City by announcing Andrew Bailey as the new head of the FCA. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he\u2019s a fine choice (although would he really say anything else?....) Andrew is an extraordinary public servant who has devoted his entire professional life to serving the people of the United Kingdom. During his career, he has worked across all of the Bank\u2019s policy areas, combining leadership and innovation to deliver consistently the Bank\u2019s policy objectives. His work in helping to manage the crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework has been exemplary. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Britain has a new City regulator. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has just been named as the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. He replaces Martin Wheatley, who was ousted by chancellor George Osborne last July. Bailey has been in charge of prudential regulation at the Bank of England - trying to sure that banks stick to the rules, and avoid the damaging risks that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Osborne\u2019s decision to sent Wheatley packing last year has been seen as a sign that the British government was taking a friendlier approach to the City. Here are a couple of photos from China\u2019s brokerage houses, as investors watched the market tumble by 6%. Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown. Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is \u201cslowing, not melting down\u201d. He argues that Beijing are taking some \u201cvery positive\u201d steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China\u2019s investment boom over the last 15 years. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months. With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn\u2019t come soon enough. Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. The budget airline said revenue suffered after November\u2019s Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt\u2019s Sharm el-Sheikh. The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it \u00a3180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out \u00a350m. In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first.... Today\u2019s selloff comes nearly a week after global markets slumped into bear market territory, triggering alarm around the world: Simon Smith, chief economist at currency trading firm FXPro, fears that more market turbulence is coming. He writes: Chinese indices are 6% lower overnight, Japanese over 2% in the red and oil is back below 30 bucks a barrel. Volatility has been rising throughout the year so far but we\u2019re still someway off the big spike in the Vix (volatility index or \u2018fear gauge\u2019) last August and so there\u2019s potential for moves in markets to get even more dramatic. Today\u2019s selloff has been triggered by the slide in the oil price, as well as the Chinese market mayhem. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Crude is sliding on renewed oversupply fears and even the building narrative we\u2019re seeing from Opec that they are ready to strike a deal with other producer nations \u2013 possibly centred around Russia \u2013 doesn\u2019t really appear to be lending any support to the equation, at least not yet. The gold price has jumped by 1%, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven assets. That\u2019s usually a sign that investors are worried. Other European markets are also falling, with France\u2019s CAC down 1.6% and the German DAX shedding 1.3%: The FTSE 100 index of major UK companies has fallen by 87 points at the start of trading, or 1.4%, to 5789 Almost every share is falling, as traders face another day of volatile trading dominated by fears over the global economy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are both down around 3%, mirroring today\u2019s sliding oil price. Mining companies are also suffering, reflecting worries about China. Commodity trader Glencore has shed 3.5%, and Anglo American (which produces iron ore, copper, nickel etc) is down 3.2% Almost every share on the Chinese stock market was hit by today\u2019s rout, with only four gaining ground. A late wave of selling has gripped the Shanghai stock market, sending shares slumping and triggering new angst in financial markets worldwide. China\u2019s benchmark index, the CSI 300, shed 188 points or 6.02% to finish the day at 2940. That\u2019s its lowest level since December 2014. Scores of shares were suspended after falling 10%, the maximum allowed under Chinese stock market regulations. The Shanghai market tumbled by 6.4%, the biggest daily loss since the first week of 2015. The selloff, which helped to drive oil down, came after new economic data showed that China\u2019s rail freight volume dropped by 11.9% last year, compared to 2014. That fuelled fears that China\u2019s economy is slowing faster than official figures show. The crude oil price has lurched back through $30 per barrel. Brent crude has slumped by 3% this morning, and is changing hands at $29.61 per barrel. The selloff is partly being driven by oversupply fears, with OPEC members sticking to their guns and keeping pumping in an apparent attempt to drive other suppliers out of business. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the weak oil price will add to the gloomy mood in the markets: The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn. But it will take hard news about declining US output to shift the market mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like being another \u2018challenging\u2019 day in the markets. Asia\u2019s two-day rally has hit the wall, with most markets falling. Japan\u2019s Nikkei just closed down 2.4%, and we\u2019re expecting European stock markets to fall at the open (8an GMT). The surge of optimism which pushed shares higher at the end of last week has dissolved, in the face of worries about deflation and economic slowdown. In the corporate sector, budget airline easyJet and high street tech chain Dixons Carphone are releasing results. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to MPs this morning about the BoE\u2019s financial stability report, from 10am GMT. And we\u2019ll have an eye on Greece, where unions are expected to hold a protest rally in Athens today against pension cuts. That comes as We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening.</p> <p>So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u2019s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound.</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up.

The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.</p> <p>There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.</p> <p>Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil fields in Kazakhstan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil fields in Kazakhstan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.</p> <p>Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.</p> <p>The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.</p> <p>However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u2013 even at a low level \u2013 should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.</p> <p>On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a79880e4b085519d006727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:06:36.100Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply.</strong></p> <p>Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Bailey, handpicked by Chancellor George Osborne to become the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, is fond of recalling a moment during the 2008 banking crisis when he was chief cashier at the Bank of England. When Royal Bank of Scotland was on the brink, its treasurer turned up in Bailey\u2019s office in Threadneedle Street asking for cash \u2013 a cool \u00a325bn \u2013 to keep afloat. \u201cThe treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack \u2026 and he looked at me and said: \u2018I need \u00a325bn today, can you do it?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes, I can do that,\u2019\u201d Bailey recalled in an interview with the Financial Times [paywall]. Such anecdotes are typical of Bailey, who at the age of 56 has been convinced to leave the role of deputy governor of the Bank of England to take the helm of the FCA. He joined the Bank of England in 1985 and worked his way up, becoming chief cashier, with his signature on bank notes between 2004 and 2011. He might not have become deputy governor of the Bank in April 2013 had Sir Hector Sants not decided to step down as the head of the nascent regulator now known as the Prudential Regulation Authority. Bailey was his deputy and ended up getting the top job. Bailey\u2019s focus until now has largely been on big City firms rather than consumers, but in 2012 he gave a speech in which he described himself as \u201clike a dog with a bone\u201d over the issue of free banking, which he said might encourage mis-selling of products.",

David Scott from Scott+Scott, the law firm representing Tesco Shareholder Claims, which is asking British shareholders to join a group seeking billions of pounds in compensation for losses, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report confirms that pressure to meet financial targets drove the company\u2019s behaviour.\u201d However, Scott said the group would wait to see the results of a separate investigation by the Serious Fraud Office before pressing ahead with its claim. Tesco is also facing potential legal action from a separate group of between 50 and 100 institutional British shareholders. Law firm Stewarts Law said it would be writing to Tesco shortly as a prelude to formal legal action that will seek to prove misleading statements were made to the market by the retailer, upon which shareholders relied when making investment decisions. Stewarts Law made the announcement on Tuesday after the UK supermarket regulator, the groceries code adjudicator, ruled that the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to support its profits. The GCA said the company had seriously breached its code and must make \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the way it deals with suppliers. Tesco is also facing potential legal action in the US, where it has already agreed a $12m (\u00a37.94m) deal to settle one of two shareholder class action suits over its accounting scandal. Stewarts Law began soliciting angry shareholders to support joint action against Tesco in September 2014, backed by Bentham Europe, an offshoot of Australian group IMF Bentham, which specialises in funding litigation. It said it was moving forward with legal action in the light of what it claimed was \u201cmounting evidence that Tesco\u2019s management were aware that the financial statements were untrue or misleading\u201d, including recent press reports that the Serious Fraud Office has interviewed former senior executives and is considering agreeing a deal with Tesco. Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, said: \u201cThe prospect of litigation is a necessary consequence of the apparent failure of Tesco\u2019s former management to protect their shareholders from avoidable losses. We hope the company will face up to the seeming failings of previous management and move swiftly to resolve this dispute.\u201d Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined the business in September 2014, just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged, said the company had not received any formal contact from shareholders with regard to legal action in the UK and had not made any financial provision for it. He added that it was misleading to link the findings of a grocery watchdog inquiry, the results of which were published on Tuesday when Stewarts Law issued its press release, to the Serious Fraud Office inquiry. \u201cWhat either investigator is investigating is different and the onus of proof is completely different,\u201d he said. There have been suggestions that the SFO could release the findings of its inquiry as early as this week. City analysts have warned that Tesco could face a \u00a3500m fine for its multimillion pound accounting scandal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On the frontlines of economic upheaval, author Farai Chideya tackles the conversation of a generation head on, and asks the big question: how can all of us establish a life of relative financial security at a time of broadening inequality and dwindling job market prospects? In her latest book, The Episodic Career, the journalist and political analyst offers a guide for American workers operating in an age of disruption and new career rules. Her proposition is an uncomfortable one: traditional career paths may have all but disappeared and precariousness may be the adjective to describe increasing amounts of Americans \u2013 including in the pseudo middle class. But with a full understanding of your individual self and the true nature of the economy and job market, she maintains fulfilment is still within reach. \u2022\u2022\u2022 There is a conversation I have consistently found myself in the middle of in recent years \u2013 with friends over beers at dive bars, with young activists at demonstrations, with colleagues driving from one midwest American city to the next, with mothers going through foreclosure in Detroit. The conversation goes something like this: we are screwed. The US economy is on its knees, the American dream is a numbing elixir that distracts us from the fact that most of us are socio-economically conditioned to be doing appallingly, and things seem to be getting worse, not better. Those of us who manage to get out and succeed are the exception, not the rule. There is comfort in having these conversations: a shared understanding of the struggle, of the witnessing of humiliating suffering many get blamed for, an understanding that our economic struggle is a systemic issue \u2013 the consequences of which we each carry on our shoulders. Chideya highlights those undeniable flaws in the system backed with data and studies, but offers advice for individuals operating within it. After all, if this is the hand we have been dealt, she seems to say, short of overhauling the entire game, there are a few things you might consider. \u201cI could have written a policy book,\u201d she explains over lunch one recent Sunday in Brooklyn. \u201cBut I wanted to reach a broader audience. I wanted to reach readers who would not normally pick up a policy book. Right now the country is in fairly transparent internal turmoil and I\u2019m hoping people will be able to connect to the ideas here.\u201d The Episodic Career is part policy summary, part journalistic narration, part self-help book. And it is this mix that is uncomfortable. A book that looks at how individuals can operate within a profoundly unequal and unfair economic system risks feeding into the very American tradition of blaming poverty and lack of success on individual choices made by people, rather than a combination of much larger, top-down forces. But Chideya rides the line of producing a book that includes a personality test called the \u201cWork/Life Matrix\u201d, which classifies readers into one of 16 work-life personality categories, without falling into the \u201cyou are the only thing holding you back\u201d self-help book trap. \u201cIndividual choices are no substitute for systemic solutions,\u201d she says, talking of the alternative labor movement unraveling over the last three years in America, through the mobilizing of fast food and domestic workers, among other groups, and advocating, among other things, for a $15 minimum wage. \u201cThe big solutions in America have to happen on a systemic level. But while systemic approaches are either pursued to the greater good or the greater detriment, or just left unkempt, people have to live their lives.\u201d There is no individual blame in Chideya\u2019s book, nor is there too much of a chirpy road map. If anything, there is a clear admittance of individuals\u2019 limitations \u2013 including in fighting things like racial discrimination, sexism and homophobia. Her discussion points are real examples of people who juggle multiple careers: in an age where simply having one career may no longer be enough; people who have successfully switched from one career to the next \u2013 a sex worker who became a welder, a journalist who became a tech exec. Chideya does not mince her words when she describes tangible examples of dos and don\u2019ts. Thinking that corporations and employers will pay for you to enhance your skills is little more than an illusion now. You\u2019re on your own: you are your own CEO \u2013 the faster you get this, the smarter the decisions you can start taking. Look for the sectors that are in growth and don\u2019t be afraid to position yourself creatively within them. Crucially too, if you think of bringing a lawsuit against your employer or complaining through official means when you\u2019ve been discriminated against or seen wrongdoing is a good idea, you might want to consider the likely possibility of retaliation, the high cost of a lawsuit and how being a whistle blower will affect future job prospects. Chideya does not advocate against any of this, in fact she quotes people who have successfully blown a whistle and who do not regret it, but she wants her reader to be realistic about consequences. In this, the book is both sobering and cautiously empowering. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going to happen, but in the end you\u2019ve got to be prepared to take care of yourself and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t destroy the rest of the world. Right now, no one is going to look out for you but you\u201d, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very chaotic time in the overall economy and probably in your company, and wherever you are too. You cannot predict what is going to happen, but you can take a thoughtful, knowledgeable, compassionate approach to the decisions that you take.\u201d The book may not yet resonate with my fellow millennials who have given up on the unpaid internships and taken the underpaid job they didn\u2019t want to take to start paying their ballooning debt, or with the gas station worker wondering which bill to prioritize with his subpar pay, but Chideya offers a few glimpses of hope. Where these glimpses fail, she offers compassionate insight into why they do.",

    "webTitle": "Tory party donor Lycamobile faces being struck off UK company register", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lycamobile, one of the Conservative party\u2019s largest corporate donors, is at risk of being struck off the register of UK businesses after failing to file accounts on time. The company, which has handed millions to the Tory party, is already facing the possibility of a \u00a39.5m bill from HM Revenue &amp; Customs for unpaid tax. Now Lycamobile, which sells international telephone airtime, has missed a deadline to publish accounts for last year by two months, according to Companies House filings. Companies House is understood to have sent two warning letters to the company, controlled by the Sri Lankan businessman Subaskaran Allirajah, without reply. The next step would involve having the company listed for late filing in the London Gazette in early February. The listing would begin an ultimatum period that could see the company struck off the register of British businesses within two months. At that point a new company would have to be set up to house Lycamobile\u2019s UK business. Despite its failure to file accounts, Lycamobile has been a generous donor to the Conservative party, handing it \u00a31.5m since 2011. Its latest available figures, from 2014, reveal it swelled Tory coffers by \u00a3146,600 last year, despite making a profit of just \u00a3767,000 after tax. The delay in filing new accounts comes with Lycamobile facing a string of questions over its financial affairs. The company is in talks with HMRC over a potential tax liability of around \u00a39.5m linked to its complex international corporate structure. Accounts from 2014 reveal that Lycamobile paid \u00a3108m to Lycatelcom LDA, a company based in the Portuguese tax haven of Madeira, ostensibly for mobile phone airtime. The payment, which involves 76% of its overall cost of sales for that year, had the effect of transferring income to the low tax jurisdiction. Income accrued at a foreign subsidiary of a UK firm is subject to tax under the Controlled Foreign Company rules. The latest available accounts for this Portuguese division show it had just four employees, despite reporting \u00a3433m of turnover. Two of those employees, Richard and Filomena Benn, run a Madeira-based company that specialises in \u201ctax planning\u201d. Accounts for WWW Holding Company \u2013 another firm in the Lycamobile network \u2013 reveal that HMRC has raised \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d over \u00a39.5m in potentially unpaid tax. It is not clear whether these discussions relate to the Madeira-based subsidiary. However, in a statement buried in the accounts, the firm admits: \u201cThe directors are in the process of assessing the company\u2019s operating model and group structure with regard to the Controlled Foreign Company tax regime.\u201d Tax expert Richard Murphy said Lycamobile\u2019s complex cross-border financial architecture raises questions over its tax contribution. He said the arrangement gave him \u201cconsiderable concerns about the pricing of this contract\u201d. \u201cThese accounts suggest that, firstly, we need more information to appraise the impact of the transactions this company undertakes, including full country-by-country reporting for all the companies with which it has relationships.\u201d He added: \u201cSecond, penalties for late filing of accounts, and prosecutions for doing so, need to be stepped up..\u201d Accounts from previous years show that Lycamobile\u2019s UK arm did not pay any tax between 2008 and 2010, despite generating a turnover of between \u00a347m and \u00a388m. The firm\u2019s most recent accounts also show that auditors KPMG were not able to obtain enough information to sign off on adjustments made to financial information from previous years. KPMG began auditing the firm after EY resigned from the duty in 2014. Lycamobile\u2019s failure to file its accounts, hard on the heels of admitting it is in talks with HMRC over its tax affairs, adds to the controversy around the company. An investigation by BuzzFeed revealed that Lycamobile employees were depositing rucksacks full of cash, some containing up to \u00a3250,000, at the Post Office. There is no suggestion of any connection to the late filing of accounts and Lycamobile has said its cash deposits were \u201cday-to-day\u201d banking sanctioned by the Post Office. Another company in Subaskaran Allirajah\u2019s business empire is under investigation in Sri Lanka, over allegations it was used to channel cash to the former president. Again, there is no suggestion of any link between the Sri Lankan investigation and the rest of the Lycamobile empire.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the deputy governors of the Bank of England has cut short his tenure to become the new City watchdog, in a move that lawyers said signals an end to banker bashing. George Osborne personally intervened to convince Andrew Bailey to become chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, which has been without a permanent head since the chancellor forced out Martin Wheatley last summer. The chancellor said Bailey \u2013 who was approached in recent weeks about the role \u2013 would be \u201ctough but fair\u201d in City dealings . But City lawyers said it heralded a new approach. John Ahern, partner at law firm Jones Day, agreed: \u201cAndrew is more centrist than his predecessor, Tracey McDermott, so \u2018bank bashing\u2019 will likely give way to constructive regulatory oversight of the industry on his watch.\u201d The chancellor revealed earlier this month that McDermott \u2013 who was considered the frontrunner for the role \u2013 did not want the job full-time in a move that caused confusion about the recruitment process for one of the highest profile roles in the City. The FCA \u2013 created by the coalition government \u2013 is responsible for clamping down on bad behaviour and McDermott had handed out a string of record fines for rigging foreign exchange and Libor markets. The chancellor said: \u201cWe have cast the net far and wide for this crucial appointment and, having led the Bank of England\u2019s response to the financial crisis, Andrew is simply the most respected, most experienced and most qualified person in the world to do the job. \u201cThe government is determined that the financial sector operates to the highest standards. Anyone who has dealt with Andrew knows he will be tough but fair, and understands the flaws and merits of the sector better than anyone.\u201d Osborne has had to fight off criticism that he encouraged the FCA at the end of last year to abandon a review into banking culture. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, stepped into that row on Tuesday by admitting that Threadneedle Street did not know the review was being dropped even though Bailey already sits on the FCA board. \u201cI have every confidence the new CEO of the FCA will be addressing this issue,\u201d Carney told MPs on the Treasury select committee. John Mann, a Labour MP on the committee, said: \u201cThis appointment shows that the Treasury and George Osborne have decided to downgrade consumer interests inside the FCA culminating in the sideways move of Andrew Bailey.\u201d Bailey \u2013 who ran the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) \u2013 said it was an honour to have been asked to take on the role. He said: \u201cRecent developments have shown that the most pressing issue in the system right now is the need for stable leadership at the FCA \u2026 After a lot of thought I have decided to move and do all that I can to make the FCA effective and successful. My intention is to move once a successor is found for the PRA, and while I will of course not be involved in that process, it matters greatly to me that it provides for the successful future of the PRA.\u201d His salary was not disclosed although Wheatley\u2019s was \u00a3460,000. Carney said Bailey was unlikely to leave for up to six months while a successor was found. Carney said there would be an open competition but that he had assembled strong team. Rob Moulton, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said the appointment of Bailey was consistent with a more conciliatory approach. \u201cPlacing a Bank of England insider at the heart of the FCA shows the triumph of old-fashioned regulation, such as building relationships with bank CEOs, over the more recent headline-grabbing fines and disciplinary action. Andrew\u2019s first challenge will be to reorganise and raise morale at the FCA, which has suffered a torrid few months,\u201d said Moulton. Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said Bailey had a tough task ahead of him. \u201cThe FCA does not just need to be a strong regulator, it also needs the support of the industry if it is to continue to make the changes needed to restore trust in financial services,\u201d said Izza. The FCA also announced the appointment of a number of new non-executive directors, including the former Treasury minister Ruth Kelly, and Lady Hogg, the former head of the prime minister\u2019s policy unit from 1990 to 1995.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carpetright looked a bit threadbare over the festive period, according to its latest update, but was given a boost by the January sales. Like for like sales in the twelve weeks to 23 January grew by 2.4% but the post Christmas period saw a 6% increase, helped by an improved interest free credit offer. The company said its full year profit expectations were unchanged, but its shares have slipped 40p to 410p. Chief executive Wilf Walsh said: While we saw some softening of like for like sales in the pre-Christmas period, reflecting lower footfall, customer numbers recovered in the important January sale period. Our trading performance over the last four weeks... gives us confidence that the enhanced interest free credit offer and strong promotions launched on Boxing Day are hitting the spot with our customers. It also saw a better than expected performance from its European business, with like for like sales up 4.2%. Peel Hunt analysts said: There are two key pillars to earnings recovery at Carpetright; rebalancing the retail estate and driving improved sales densities. Store closures in the current financial year are already on track to create annualised cost savings of more than \u00a310m, the driving factor behind forecast upgrades in December. The sharp pick up in interest free credit penetration as a result of greater staff focus and a revamped offer creates the potential for short term trading upside. Trading on 2017 estimated PE of 17.1 times and delivering compound earnings per share growth of around 25%, the recent share price weakness represents a more compelling entry point for investors. Shore Capital analyst George Mensah said: Today\u2019s update reflects a period where trading on the High Street was much more challenging, consequentially impacting the likes of Carpetright. It is also possible that the UK consumer may have prioritised lower ticket purchases during the run up to Christmas in light of an increased promotional environment, whilst being fully aware of the propensity to discount, after the festive period, by Home Furnishing retailers. However we remain bullish on the stock given both, the acceleration in trading post Christmas, where like for like sales increased 6.0% and also what we believe to be the long-term benefit of operating from a much smaller base of retail stores. Guidance for full year profit expectations remains unchanged, with our current forecast for 2016 set as \u00a317.5m. Whilst we believe today\u2019s statement could lead to mild downward pressure on the current share price, we remain optimistic that Carpetright is an attractive play in the small cap consumer space. But Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald was less enthusiastic: Wilf Walsh\u2019s strategy, which is likely to include a store refurbishment programme and several new initiatives, is sensible. However, we do not expect these initiatives to lead to a step up in earnings momentum despite significant operational gearing in the company\u2019s margin structure. On that basis, the stock, we believe, is too highly rated at 23 times 2016 earnings putting it at a premium to peers. We are reducing our \u2018top of the range\u2019 forecasts. We are maintaining our hold recommendation, but reducing our target price to 440p (from 470p) partly to reflect the earnings downgrade.",

Guidance for full year profit expectations remains unchanged, with our current forecast for 2016 set as \u00a317.5m.</p> <p>Whilst we believe today\u2019s statement could lead to mild downward pressure on the current share price, we remain optimistic that Carpetright is an attractive play in the small cap consumer space.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald was less enthusiastic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wilf Walsh\u2019s strategy, which is likely to include a store refurbishment programme and several new initiatives, is sensible. However, we do not expect these initiatives to lead to a step up in earnings momentum despite significant operational gearing in the company\u2019s margin structure. On that basis, the stock, we believe, is too highly rated at 23 times 2016 earnings putting it at a premium to peers. We are reducing our \u2018top of the range\u2019 forecasts. We are maintaining our hold recommendation, but reducing our target price to 440p (from 470p) partly to reflect the earnings downgrade.</p> </blockquote>",

Sales in its pubs and bars topped \u00a33m on Christmas Day for the first time. Marston\u2019s reported 3% like-for-like sales growth at its 400 premium managed pubs in the 16 weeks to 23 January. Food sales were 2.5% ahead while drinks recorded 3.4% growth. Over the key Christmas and new year fortnight to 2 January, sales growth was even stronger, at 4.9%, and operating margins were ahead of last year. The news drove the company\u2019s shares nearly 6% higher to 159.4p in early trading on Tuesday, making it one of the top risers on the FTSE 250. Marston\u2019s has about 1,600 managed, franchised and leased pubs and is Britain\u2019s largest brewer of cask ales. Aside from Pedigree, its other beers include Banks\u2019s, Jennings, Hobgoblin and Brakspear. Brewing volumes rose 21%, boosted by the acquisition of Thwaites and underpinned by a strong sales performance in off-licences and supermarkets, Marston\u2019s said. Supermarkets have toasted soaring sales of sparkling wine, beer and gin at bargain prices, which delivered a better than expected Christmas for grocers, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel. German discount chains Aldi and Lidl have won over middle-class shoppers by offering cheap deals on alcohol, including champagne, prompting others to follow suit.

Brakes had not officially decided to float but its advisers had been holding discussions with potential investors with a view to determining any possible appetite for a deal. However, a meeting with investors thought most likely to participate is understood to have been cancelled.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney fears Brexit would leave UK relying on 'kindness of strangers'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that concerns about a UK exit from the EU could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d that the UK relies on to fund its hefty current account deficit with the rest of the world. Britain\u2019s economy has grown strongly over the past two years but the forthcoming vote on its membership of the European Union has emphasised some of its vulnerabilities. Near the top of this list is Britain\u2019s current account deficit, which at 3.7% of GDP is large by international standards. It could be made worse by a weakening global economy or if investors wanted greater returns to hold British assets, Carney told MPs in an appearance before the Treasury select committee. \u201cThe global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment,\u201d he said. Carney was careful not to mention the looming in/out referendum but added: \u201cThe possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets, because of certain developments, exists and that plays into the riskiness of the situation.\u201d The BoE has previously said it will watch carefully for signs that Britain \u2013 which suffered balance of payments trouble in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 might find it harder to cover its shortfall with the outside world due to concerns about the referendum. Carney said the BoE would have measures in place to protect financial stability if Britain opts to leave the European Union. On Tuesday the government signalled its interest in holding the referendum in June by publishing the conduct regulations for the referendum in parliament. David Lidington, the Europe minister, also signed a commencement order which means that the EU referendum act can formally come into force. The order allowed the Electoral Commission to open the process for the registration of EU referendum campaigners who intend to spend more than \u00a310,000 during the referendum period. The two moves were seen as significant because the Electoral Commission had made clear that secondary legislation, which must be passed before the referendum can be held, should be introduced six months before the referendum. The secondary legislation, or statutory instruments, will set the date of the referendum and permit the electoral commission to designate the two main campaigns on either side of the campaign. Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, told peers that it would be difficult to hold the referendum in June if the prime minister fails to secure a deal with fellow EU leaders in February. \u201cIf we get a deal done in February it will be possible to hold a referendum in June if we choose to do so,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cThere is technically enough time. If the deal is not done in February that would become much more difficult. Certainly if it is not done in March it would become impossible because of the timescales provided for in the bill.\u201d Last October Carney said that EU membership opened up the UK economy and made it more dynamic, but also left it more exposed to financial shocks. He told MPs that any steps taken to shore up the markets as a result of the referendum would be disclosed afterwards. \u201cMaterial decisions (from the referendum) can have an impact on financial stability. Our responsibility is to ensure that the resilience of the system has been increased in order to withstand those (decisions),\u201d Carney said. Carney also faced questions about the Bank\u2019s concerns over financial stability, following last month\u2019s publication of its half-yearly assessment of risks, which include the buy-to-let market and the global economic backdrop. Government policy to increase taxes on buy-to-let landlords might avoid the need for the Bank of England to act, MPs were told. The evidence session was held against the worse start for financial markets in history amid concerns about the fall in the price of oil and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. He was asked about his intentions to stay beyond the five-year term he negotiated when he was appointed as governor of the Bank of England in November 2012, rather than the expected eight year term. He did not rule out continuing beyond his five-year term, which ends in June 2018. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told Carney: \u201cThe sooner you feel able to give us this clarity the better, governor\u201d. Carney last week ruled out an early rise in interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been stuck since the financial crisis. He was asked if the decision by the US to start tightening monetary policy in December was cause for the current market volatility, to which he said it was a \u201ccontributory factor\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s long been the view of the [Bank of England] that the start of the tightening of US monetary policy could lead to a tightening of global financial conditions and could accelerate weakness. We haves seen some of that,\u201d said Carney. He also said that the low price of oil \u2013 currently at a 12-year low \u2013 was a \u201cnet positive for the global economy\u201d. The banking system was now strong enough to withstand the turbulence, he said.",

The secondary legislation, or statutory instruments, will set the date of the referendum and permit the electoral commission to designate the two main campaigns on either side of the campaign.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, told peers that it would be difficult to hold the referendum in June if the prime minister fails to secure a deal with fellow EU leaders in February. \u201cIf we get a deal done in February it will be possible to hold a referendum in June if we choose to do so,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cThere is technically enough time. If the deal is not done in February that would become much more difficult. Certainly if it is not done in March it would become impossible because of the timescales provided for in the bill.\u201d</p> <p>Last<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/21/eu-economy-more-dynamic-bank-of-england-chief-mark-carney-referendum\"> October</a> Carney said that EU membership opened up the UK economy and made it more dynamic, but also left it more exposed to financial shocks. </p> <p>He told MPs that any steps taken to shore up the markets as a result of the referendum would be disclosed afterwards. \u201cMaterial decisions (from the referendum) can have an impact on financial stability. Our responsibility is to ensure that the resilience of the system has been increased in order to withstand those (decisions),\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>Carney also faced questions about the Bank\u2019s concerns over financial stability, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/bank-stress-tests-rbs-and-standard-chartered-weakest-in-crash-scenario\">last month\u2019s publication of its half-yearly assessment of risks</a>, which include the buy-to-let market and the global economic backdrop. Government policy to increase taxes on buy-to-let landlords might avoid the need for the Bank of England to act, MPs were told.</p> <p>The evidence session was held against the worse start for financial markets in history amid concerns about the fall in the price of oil and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.</p> <p>He was asked about his intentions to stay beyond the five-year term he negotiated when he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/26/new-bank-of-england-governor-named\">appointed as governor of the Bank of England in November 2012</a>, rather than the expected eight year term. <br></p> <p>He did not rule out continuing beyond his five-year term, which ends in June 2018.<br></p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told Carney: \u201cThe sooner you feel able to give us this clarity the better, governor\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/bank-of-england-mark-carney-rules-out-uk-interest-rate-rise\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Carney last week ruled out an early rise in interest rates</a> from 0.5%, where they have been stuck since the financial crisis. <span tabindex=\"-1\">He was </span><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rates-janet-yellen-live\">asked if the decision by the US to start tightening monetary policy</a><span tabindex=\"-1\"> in December</span> was cause for the current market volatility<span tabindex=\"-1\">, to which he said it was a \u201ccontributory factor\u201d.</span></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s long been the view of the [Bank of England] that the start of the tightening of US monetary policy could lead to a tightening of global financial conditions and could accelerate weakness.

      "bodyText": "Dixons Carphone reported that sales of mobile phones helped the electricals and gadgets retailer achieve strong Christmas sales but said it will close 134 shops this year. The company, formed from the merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in 2014, said it would merge its remaining Currys and PC World shops and add a Carphone Warehouse department to each of the combined stores. Most of the closures in the UK and Ireland will come from shutting 79 large PC World and Currys stores so there will be no standalone shops remaining for each brand. Dixons Carphone said no employees would lose their jobs and staff would be offered positions at a merged store near their current workplace. Combining the brands will save about \u00a320m a year from 2017-18 with sales unchanged or better. Revenues at shops open for a year or more and online rose 5% in the 10 weeks to 9 January, Dixons Carphone in a trading statement. Pretax profit for the current financial year will be \u00a3440m to \u00a3450m, slightly higher than the average City analyst\u2019s forecast of \u00a3440m, the company said. Dixons Carphone shares, up about 10% in the past year, fell 1.6% to 460p in early trading on Tuesday. Most of the Christmas sales increase came from mobile phones, with televisions and domestic appliances such as Dyson cordless vacuum cleaners also selling well. The company said in mid-December it expected a strong Christmas after record sales during the discount Black Friday period at the end of November. Sebastian James, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe think it was a good Christmas trading period. We are now also taking the opportunity to put our estate into its long-term shape by rolling out the three-in-one format across the UK and Ireland. Our experience has taught us that the net effect on both sales and colleague levels is likely to be neutral or better.\u201d Dixons Carphone has shops in Scandinavia and southern Europe, where a strong performance at its Greek business helped sales at established stores rise 9%. David Cameron, who has known James since they were at Eton school, last week called for British businesses to get behind the campaign to stay in the EU at a referendum expected this year. Humphrey Singer, Dixons\u2019 Carphone\u2019s finance director, said the company would wait until the prime minister completes talks with other EU leaders before stating its position, but added: \u201cGenerally, we are keen, as a consumer-facing company that we live in a world where they [consumers] have a degree of certainty that gives them confidence to shop.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The grocery market watchdog has ordered Tesco to make \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the way it deals with suppliers after finding the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to boost its profits. Christine Tacon, the groceries code adjudicator (GCA), said Tesco had seriously breached the legally binding code governing the grocery market. She said some suppliers had to wait two years for millions of pounds owed by the grocer. However, Tacon is unable to fine the supermarket as the breaches took place before her power to levy fines came into force in April last year. \u201cI was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly,\u201d Tacon said. She added that she had seen internal emails suggesting payments should not be made ahead of a certain date in order to avoid missing targets promised to City investors. In some cases this occurred despite suppliers\u2019 requests for payment, at other times it was with their consent. \u201cThe pressure on buyers and finance teams to meet margin targets was the overriding pressure within the business. It was widespread. It was everywhere,\u201d she said. Tacon also criticised the company for unilaterally making deductions from invoice payments. Even when Tesco acknowledged a debt, Tacon said that on some occasions the money was not repaid for more than a year, or as long as two years. The adjudicator launched the investigation in February last year after Tesco admitted it had overstated profits in a scandal that has also led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, who joined the business in September 2014 just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged and was in post for only four months of the period investigated by Tacon, apologised to suppliers and said the retailer had now \u201cfundamentally changed\u201d. \u201cOver the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. The absolute focus on operating margin [under former boss Phil Clarke] had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers,\u201d he said. Tacon said Tesco had \u201cacted unreasonably\u201d by delaying payments to suppliers, often for lengthy periods and sometimes deliberately to support its profits ahead of key financial reporting periods. For example, a list of methods for meeting a half-year profit target seen by Tacon included \u201cnot paying back money owed\u201d. She considered Tesco\u2019s breach of the code to be serious because of the varied and widespread nature of the delays in payment. \u201cThe most shocking thing I found was how widespread it was. Every supplier I spoke to had evidence of delays in payments,\u201d Tacon said. One supplier was owed several million pounds as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied over a long period, but Tesco took two years to refund the money. \u201cThe sums were often significant and the length of time taken to repay them was too long,\u201d she said at the launch of her 60-plus page report. While in some cases the delays were due to deliberate policy, Tacon found buyers were given \u201ccontradictory and unclear\u201d guidance about the importance of hitting margin targets. Some delays were the result of poor administration and communication and Tesco had \u201cinadequate processes\u201d for correcting errors, for example where data had been input wrongly. She has given the retailer a month to say how it plans to implement her recommendations, which include paying suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, correcting pricing errors within a week of notification by a supplier, and calling a halt to unilateral deductions from invoices. Suppliers will now have 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction. The adjudicator also said Tesco must improve its invoices, making them clearer and more transparent for suppliers, and train its finance teams and buyers. She said many of the problems encountered related to unclear terms in Tesco\u2019s agreements with suppliers and deals not being put into writing \u2013 something she has referred to the competition watchdog, the CMA. Tacon said many suppliers had reported an improvement in relations with Tesco since the period under investigation, June 2013 until February 2015. She said she had found no evidence that Tesco had required suppliers to make payments to secure better shelf positioning or to increase the amount of space allocated to them on shelves. However, she will now launch an industry-wide consultation examining payments made by suppliers in order to participate when Tesco reviewed the range of products stocked in a particular category or in order to be made a \u201ccategory captain\u201d, where they could advise on how best to display products. Tesco also asked for \u201cinvestment\u201d from suppliers to help underpin profits in a particular category. Tacon said such payments could amount to tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds per supplier. Tacon said: \u201cThere were a range of practices that I am concerned could amount to an indirect requirement for payment [related to positioning of products on shelves], contravening the code.\u201d Lewis said: \u201cIn 2014 we undertook our own review into certain historic practices, which were both unsustainable and harmful to our suppliers. We shared these practices with the adjudicator, and publicly apologised. Today, I would like to apologise again. We are sorry. We accept the report\u2019s findings, which are consistent with our own investigation. He said Tesco had already implemented all the recommendations of the GCA and had completely changed its practices since January 2015. He said Tesco had also stopped asking for payments related to \u201ccategory captain\u201d status or range reviews, but the company would look at making further changes in the light of Tacon\u2019s planned consultation. \u201cWe have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations,\u201d Lewis said. While Tesco could not be fined, it could have been required to take out newspaper advertisements laying out its apology. Tacon said she had not used this power as Lewis had publicly apologised and Tesco\u2019s suppliers gave evidence that dealings had now improved. The supermarket must now report quarterly to the GCA on the measures she has asked it to introduce and Tacon can launch a new investigation if she finds her recommendations have not been followed through. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said: \u201cChristine Tacon has done a thorough and fearless investigation into a scandalous situation. Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence.\u201d",

More surprisingly, Anglo American is up 3.7p at 230.3p. But its gains can be attributed to news that rough diamond sales from its De Beers group had more than doubled from $248m to $540m in the first sales period of this year compared to the final one of 2015. On the precious metals front, Randgold Resources has risen 77p to \u00a346.73 while Fresnillo is up 11p at 669p. But with Brent crude sliding 2.3% to $29.79 on continuing oversupply fears, markets are again under pressure. News this week of record production from Iraq has outweighed talk from Opec of possible cuts in tandem with other producers. A drop in Chinese rail freight volume raised fears the country\u2019s economy is growing by less than the official figures show. So the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.3% or 81.37 points to 5795.63, with oil companies among the biggest losers. Royal Dutch Shell is down 45p to \u00a313.57 and BP is off 9.9p at 340.25p. Banks have also dipped, with Barclays down 5.8p at 176.05p as analysts at UBS cut their price target from 302p to 215p albeit with a buy rating. Dixons Carphone is down 6.3p at 460.8p despite a strong Christmas update, but its announcement of a new deal with TalkTalk has pushed the telecoms company up 14.4p to 204.4p.

    "webTitle": "Google tax deal: MPs launch inquiry after criticism of \u00a3130m settlement", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs have launched an inquiry into the UK\u2019s tax system after the government was accused of allowing Google to pay too little in a \u00a3130m deal. The House of Commons Treasury committee announced that it would examine whether a radical shakeup of corporation tax was needed, amid concern that Google has been allowed to get away with an effective rate of 3%. The inquiry is not directed at Google, but will investigate the UK\u2019s shrinking corporate tax base more widely and whether HMRC is doing enough to tackle avoidance. It will ask whether there needs to be a radical shakeup of the system, and whether business taxation could be based on turnover rather than profits. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee, said the UK\u2019s tax law had become too elastic, allowing companies to get away legally with paying too little. \u201cThe complexity of tax law is turning what should be a straightforward principle \u2013 that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax \u2013 into a piece of elastic. For corporation tax, for instance, the problem is exacerbated by the globalisation of economic activity and any liability to tax that accompanies it,\u201d he said. \u201cA corporation\u2019s duty to shareholders will be to minimise its tax liability. It should be the duty of those making tax policy to find better ways to limit the elasticity. Google may be the symptom, but it is not the cause. \u201cThere is a lot the government could be doing. Tax policy must be made more practicable and the tax system more coherent. Tax needs to be fair. It needs to provide more certainty and stability. There is a lot to do and a lot for the committee to examine.\u201d Speaking in the House of Commons, Tyrie suggested \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of the tax base might need to be considered in light of the Google case. In the same debate, George Osborne was mocked by Labour for claiming the government\u2019s \u00a3130m deal with Google was a \u201cmajor success\u201d after No 10 failed to show similar enthusiasm. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Osborne had managed to unite opinion against the deal, which has been criticised for recovering too little from Google. In an urgent question to the House of Commons, McDonnell also called on the Treasury to publish details of the negotiations and how the deal was reached. \u201cThe chancellor has managed to create an unlikely alliance between myself, the Sun newspaper, the mayor of London and, according to reports, even No 10 this morning. All of us think this deal is not the \u2018major success\u2019 the chancellor claimed at the weekend,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the minister agree it\u2019s important that everyone is treated equally and fairly whether they be large multi-billion pound corporations or small businesses?\u201d He told MPs that experts have estimated Google paid an effective tax rate of around 3% over the past decade, despite a UK corporation tax rate of more than 20%. Osborne confirmed the deal in a tweet at the weekend during the World Economic Forum in Davos, and told the Guardian that it was a \u201cmajor success of our tax policy\u201d. \u201cI hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I\u2019ve introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it\u2019s a big step forward and a victory for the government,\u201d he said at the time. However, Labour has branded it a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d and even some Tory MPs have questioned the small size of the sum collected. Steve Baker, a Conservative MP, said the tax deal with Google was \u201cderisory\u201d and \u201cunacceptable to the public\u201d, even though it is legal. He called for a thorough overhaul of the system. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, used his Telegraph column to criticise the \u201cquite derisory sums [paid] in tax to the UK Exchequer\u201d by US tech companies, but blamed the system rather than the firms. \u201cIt has never seemed fair that some of these companies \u2013 no matter how wonderful the service they provide \u2013 should be paying so much less in tax than the high-street tea rooms and bookshops they have pulverised. It would be a good thing, both for the UK finances and for the image of these great companies, if they paid more,\u201d he wrote. Downing Street also failed to express fulsome support for the deal when pressed about whether David Cameron thought it was a \u201cmajor success\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s a step forward. We\u2019ve always been clear that we want to see low taxes for business, but these taxes must be paid. \u201cClearly there is more for the government to do to make sure that multinational companies pay their tax. The assessments of this are made by HMRC \u2013 it\u2019s for them to assess what money is due.\u201d Asked about the deal as he toured a factory on Monday, Osborne said Labour had failed to address tax avoidance and collect more tax when it was in office. \u201cIt\u2019s good news that we are collecting tax from companies like Google, thanks to the action this government has taken to make sure, yes, we have less taxes, but those taxes are paid,\u201d he said. With Osborne on a regional tour, the task of defending the deal in the House of Commons was left to the Treasury\u2019s financial secretary, David Gauke. He said he \u201cwelcomed the progress the government over the last six years in making sure large companies pay more tax than they did before\u201d. Corporation tax receipts excluding those from North Sea oil had remained \u201cbuoyant\u201d despite cuts in the rate, he added. Gauke also said calling the agreement with Google a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d was insulting to HMRC staff who had worked for years to make sure the tax due under the law was paid.",

For corporation tax, for instance, the problem is exacerbated by the globalisation of economic activity and any liability to tax that accompanies it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA corporation\u2019s duty to shareholders will be to minimise its tax liability. It should be the duty of those making tax policy to find better ways to limit the elasticity. Google may be the symptom, but it is not the cause.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot the government could be doing. Tax policy must be made more practicable and the tax system more coherent. Tax needs to be fair. It needs to provide more certainty and stability. There is a lot to do and a lot for the committee to examine.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in the House of Commons, Tyrie suggested \u201cfundamental reform\u201d of the tax base might need to be considered in light of the Google case.</p> <p>In the same debate, George Osborne was mocked by Labour for claiming the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/22/google-agrees-to-pay-hmrc-130m-in-back-taxes\">\u00a3130m deal with Google</a> was a \u201cmajor success\u201d after No 10 failed to show similar enthusiasm.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Osborne had managed to unite opinion against the deal, which has been criticised for recovering too little from Google.</p> <p>In an urgent question to the House of Commons, McDonnell also called on the Treasury to publish details of the negotiations and how the deal was reached.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor has managed to create an unlikely alliance between myself, the Sun newspaper, the mayor of London and, according to reports, even No 10 this morning. All of us think this deal is not the \u2018major success\u2019 the chancellor claimed at the weekend,\u201d McDonnell said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/23/mps-attack-deal-to-let-google-pay-relatively-trivial-130m-in-back-taxes\">MPs attack deal to let Google to pay 'relatively trivial' \u00a3130m back taxes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the minister agree it\u2019s important that everyone is treated equally and fairly whether they be large multi-billion pound corporations or small businesses?\u201d</p> <p>He told MPs that experts have estimated Google paid an effective tax rate of around 3% over the past decade, despite a UK corporation tax rate of more than 20%.</p> <p>Osborne confirmed the deal in a tweet at the weekend during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/world-economic-forum-davos-2016-eight-key-themes-robotics-migration-markets-climate-change-europe-medicine-inequality-cybercrime\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/23/davos-2016-george-osborne-christine-lagarde-world-economy-live\">told the Guardian</a> that it was a \u201cmajor success of our tax policy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I\u2019ve introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it\u2019s a big step forward and a victory for the government,\u201d he said at the time.</p> <p>However, Labour has branded it a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d and even some Tory MPs have questioned the small size of the sum collected.</p> <p>Steve Baker, a Conservative MP, said the tax deal with Google was \u201cderisory\u201d and \u201cunacceptable to the public\u201d, even though it is legal. He called for a thorough overhaul of the system.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the London mayor, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/12118898/We-all-want-Apple-to-pay-more-tax.html\">used his Telegraph column</a> to criticise the \u201cquite derisory sums [paid] in tax to the UK Exchequer\u201d by US tech companies, but blamed the system rather than the firms.</p> <p>\u201cIt has never seemed fair that some of these companies \u2013 no matter how wonderful the service they provide \u2013 should be paying so much less in tax than the high-street tea rooms and bookshops they have pulverised. It would be a good thing, both for the UK finances and for the image of these great companies, if they paid more,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Downing Street also failed to express fulsome support for the deal when pressed about whether David Cameron thought it was a \u201cmajor success\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s a step forward. We\u2019ve always been clear that we want to see low taxes for business, but these taxes must be paid.</p> <p>\u201cClearly there is more for the government to do to make sure that multinational companies pay their tax. The assessments of this are made by HMRC \u2013 it\u2019s for them to assess what money is due.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the deal as he toured a factory on Monday, Osborne said Labour had failed to address tax avoidance and collect more tax when it was in office. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good news that we are collecting tax from companies like Google, thanks to the action this government has taken to make sure, yes, we have less taxes, but those taxes are paid,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With Osborne on a regional tour, the task of defending the deal in the House of Commons was left to the Treasury\u2019s financial secretary, David Gauke.</p> <p>He said he \u201cwelcomed the progress the government over the last six years in making sure large companies pay more tax than they did before\u201d. Corporation tax receipts excluding those from North Sea oil had remained \u201cbuoyant\u201d despite cuts in the rate, he added.</p> <p>Gauke also said calling the agreement with Google a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d was insulting to HMRC staff who had worked for years to make sure the tax due under the law was paid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Outdoor types, known for their love of the wilderness and healthy lifestyles, are contributing to the accumulation of toxic and long-lasting synthetic chemicals that are now found in everything from remote lakes to human breast milk. Perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, have been found in 36 of 40 outdoor products tested by Greenpeace, including bags, jackets, trousers, tents and sleeping bags by a number of leading brands. PFCs are chemicals used to make surfaces repel water and oil. They do not occur naturally, do not degrade, many last indefinitely in the environment, and are eliminated very slowly from humans and other animals. Since they started being used in the 1950s, PFCs have been found everywhere from foetal cord blood to breast milk as well as in wilderness areas. Laboratory studies have linked the chemicals to reproductive and developmental problems in animals. Last year more than 200 scientists signed the Madrid Statement calling for PFCs to be phased out. Responses from manufacturers of products that contain PFCs were mixed. The FluoroCouncil, which represents companies making PFCs, rejected the statement, saying PFCs were \u201ccritical to modern life\u201d and phasing them out was unrealistic. However some outdoor product manufacturers made statements saying they planned to develop alternatives to PFCs, with the aim of phasing them out. To step up pressure on the industry, Greenpeace collected 40 products including bags, jackets, trousers, tents and sleeping bags from leading outdoor brands and sent them to an independent laboratory for analysis. All but four of the products were found to contain PFCs. And 18 of the products contained the more harmful and persistent long-chain PFCs, which most of the tested brands have stated they no longer use. \u201cWe found high levels of PFOA, a long-chain PFC that is linked to a number of health effects, including cancer, in some products from [brands] the North Face and Mammut. This substance is already restricted in Norway. These are disappointing results for outdoor lovers who want their clothes to be as sustainable and clean as the places they explore,\u201d said Mirjam Kopp, Greenpeace\u2019s Detox Outdoor project leader. \u201cBrands like the North Face and Mammut are not walking their talk of love and respect for nature when it comes to the chemicals they use in the production chain. Together with the outdoor community, we challenge them to show us what true leadership and respect for nature means: stop using hazardous chemicals and detox their gear now,\u201d said Kopp. The Greenpeace report said the four products that were PFC-free showed it could be done. One small outdoor company, P\u00e1ramo, joined the Greenpeace campaign, and said it had already eliminated PFCs from its products. \u201cMost outdoor brands, with the exception of P\u00e1ramo, are still wedded to the use of PFC-based water repellents. These materials are either directly released or they break down to form extremely toxic and persistent PFC chemicals which have migrated to the furthest reaches of the world,\u201d P\u00e1ramo said in a statement. \u201cP\u00e1ramo asserts and has proven that high waterproof performance does not require PFC pollution.\u201d Mammut told Guardian Australia it intended to eliminate PFCs from its products but could not give a timeframe since it still needed to find \u201can alternative to PFC that fulfills the needs of alpinists\u201d. In August last year North Face said it had a general goal of moving towards a PFC-free supply chain. This week North Face said it would aim to do so by 2020, which would have knock-on effects for the entire outdoor industry. \u201cWe know that once our suppliers convert to non-fluorinated DWR, they will be able to provide that option to other brands, and together, we can help advance the industry in the right direction,\u201d North Face said. Kopp praised North Face for recognising the problem but said 2020 was not soon enough. \u201cThe deadline they have set doesn\u2019t really show the leadership that the outdoor community is asking them for,\u201d she said. Presenting the report at an outdoor trade show in Munich, Gernmany, Greenpeace also launched a global campaign calling on outdoor brands to phase out PFCs. Several of the brands mentioned in the report were approached for comment.",
