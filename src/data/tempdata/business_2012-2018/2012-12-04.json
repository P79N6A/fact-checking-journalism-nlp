      "bodyText": "Large UK supermarkets which abuse their power in the marketplace and treat suppliers \"unfairly\" could be fined by a new watchdog under changes announced by the Department for Business. In a U-turn hailed by campaigners, ministers have bowed to pressure from MPs and groups lobbying on behalf of farmers and other food suppliers to toughen up the new Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA). The proposed legislative framework originally specified that the adjudicator should have only the power to \"name and shame\" any stores which flout the code. The business secretary, Vince Cable, reserved the right to introduce fines at a later date if the system did not work. But the competition minister, Jo Swinson, announced on Tuesday that the adjudicator would have the power, from the start, to fine supermarkets which abuse their power in the marketplace \u2013 for example by forcing down wholesale prices to below cost levels in a move that would penalise suppliers. Swinson said: \"Where supermarkets are breaking the rules with suppliers and treating them unfairly the adjudicator will make sure that they are held to account. \"We have heard the views of the stakeholders who were keen to give the adjudicator a power to fine, and recognise that this change would give the adjudicator more teeth to enforce the Groceries Code.\" The Groceries Code applies to the 10 UK retailers with a turnover in the groceries market in excess of \u00a31bn. The watchdog will be able to arbitrate disputes between retailers and suppliers, investigate complaints from direct and indirect suppliers, and hold to account \u2013 and if necessary fine \u2013 retailers who break the rules. The GCA bill is in the final stages of its passage through parliament, which has been far from an easy ride. The issue of fines dominated its second reading in the House of Commons in November as MPs from all parties lined up to demand that the government added powers to the GCA to impose financial penalties as soon as it was set up. The level of fines are still to be agreed, however, and will be determined by Cable in the coming weeks. Charities welcomed the government's decision to give the watchdog \"teeth\". Murray Worthy, supermarkets campaigner for the anti-poverty charity War on Want, said: \"We welcome the government's announcement that its supermarket watchdog will have the power to impose fines for bullying suppliers. \"This breakthrough has only come through dedicated campaigning, with members of the public across the country pushing MPs for action to curb supermarkets' excessive power. \"It is a great step towards securing fair treatment for workers around the world who pick, pack and grow our food.\" Paul Chandler, chief executive of charity Traidcraft, added: \"We are delighted that the government has agreed that the supermarket watchdog should have the power to fine. \"It will reassure farmers in developing countries that it is worth protesting if supermarkets make unreasonable demands on them, such as changing the price or the amount ordered at the last minute.\" He said the charity's campaigners had been \"pressing the government for months \u2013 and the minister herself praised our supporters for their 'tireless campaigning' \u2013 even taking our tiny 'toothless watchdog' to the House of Commons to illustrate the point.\"",

      "body": "<p>When George Osborne announces his \u00a35bn infrastructure package, he will sell it as a powerful boost to the UK economy. Take money away from faceless Whitehall bureaucrats and spend it on building schools and upgrading rail lines, the argument goes, and you get more bang for your buck.</p> <p>The idea is that, in economist-speak, the \"multiplier\" for investment spending is larger: each pound spent on fixing potholes has a bigger ripple effect, from the Treasury and out through the economy.</p> <p>In the short term, private sector contractors in the crisis-hit construction sector are hired to do the work, creating new jobs; in the longer term, the economy can function better, and grow faster, because it has smoother transport links/better-taught kids/whizzier broadband.</p> <p>But there are (at least) four reasons to be cautious about Osborne's plan to build our way out of this deep economic malaise. First, the positive impact on growth is likely to be so small as to be all but invisible. Remember, there is no new money here: it's a switch from day-to-day spending to investment, and from some departments to others. So any uplift to growth will have to come from the difference between the multipliers for the two types of spending.</p> <p>Duncan Weldon, of the TUC, calculates that even if we assume a multiplier of one for current spending, and double that for capital spending \u2013 a much larger gap than most analysts acknowledge \u2013 GDP would be boosted by a measly 0.4% over the next two years. Using the Office for Budget Responsibility's multipliers, it would be just 0.15%. That's marginal.</p> <p>Second, the idea that there are armies of \"backroom\" civil servants who could be culled without any impact on frontline services is a red herring. Gordon Brown had already undertaken several rounds of \"efficiency savings\" long before the general election, and public services up and down the country are being pared back mercilessly. There simply cannot be much more fat to cut.</p> <p>Bureaucrats may not be the most sympathetic of characters to the public, but sacking them is not costless. Even if their plight won't arouse the fury of the public, every out-of-work civil servant who doesn't immediately get hoovered up by a private sector employer means less spending in their local economy. And while that will be felt immediately, even the most \"shovel-ready\" infrastructure projects take time to get started: Osborne announced a slew of plans in last year's autumn statement, many of which have yet to get off the drawing board.</p> <p>Third, much of this \"new\" spending will simply replace investment that has already been hacked back sharply. While there is new spending on Michael Gove's free schools, for example, the coalition cancelled the controversial Building Schools for the Future scheme, stalling or cancelling hundreds of refurbishment and rebuilding projects. So at best, we'll be back where we started.</p> <p>Finally (the cynical hack writes), it's always wise to be wary of anything that emerges from the Treasury in the days before one of the chancellor's set-piece outings at the dispatch box. For one thing, it probably means an avalanche of bad news is coming that would otherwise have submerged this sop to the frustrated business lobby; and for another, it's hard to analyse without full details of the figures. When he stands up to explain how he is going to nurse the flatlining economy back to health, let's hope the chancellor comes up with something better than this.</p>",

In the short term, private sector contractors in the crisis-hit construction sector are hired to do the work, creating new jobs; in the longer term, the economy can function better, and grow faster, because it has smoother transport links/better-taught kids/whizzier broadband. But there are (at least) four reasons to be cautious about Osborne's plan to build our way out of this deep economic malaise. First, the positive impact on growth is likely to be so small as to be all but invisible. Remember, there is no new money here: it's a switch from day-to-day spending to investment, and from some departments to others. So any uplift to growth will have to come from the difference between the multipliers for the two types of spending. Duncan Weldon, of the TUC, calculates that even if we assume a multiplier of one for current spending, and double that for capital spending \u2013 a much larger gap than most analysts acknowledge \u2013 GDP would be boosted by a measly 0.4% over the next two years. Using the Office for Budget Responsibility's multipliers, it would be just 0.15%. That's marginal. Second, the idea that there are armies of \"backroom\" civil servants who could be culled without any impact on frontline services is a red herring. Gordon Brown had already undertaken several rounds of \"efficiency savings\" long before the general election, and public services up and down the country are being pared back mercilessly. There simply cannot be much more fat to cut. Bureaucrats may not be the most sympathetic of characters to the public, but sacking them is not costless. Even if their plight won't arouse the fury of the public, every out-of-work civil servant who doesn't immediately get hoovered up by a private sector employer means less spending in their local economy. And while that will be felt immediately, even the most \"shovel-ready\" infrastructure projects take time to get started: Osborne announced a slew of plans in last year's autumn statement, many of which have yet to get off the drawing board. Third, much of this \"new\" spending will simply replace investment that has already been hacked back sharply. While there is new spending on Michael Gove's free schools, for example, the coalition cancelled the controversial Building Schools for the Future scheme, stalling or cancelling hundreds of refurbishment and rebuilding projects. So at best, we'll be back where we started. Finally (the cynical hack writes), it's always wise to be wary of anything that emerges from the Treasury in the days before one of the chancellor's set-piece outings at the dispatch box. For one thing, it probably means an avalanche of bad news is coming that would otherwise have submerged this sop to the frustrated business lobby; and for another, it's hard to analyse without full details of the figures. When he stands up to explain how he is going to nurse the flatlining economy back to health, let's hope the chancellor comes up with something better than this.",

Long said Tui was fully committed to France and following a number of measures, was hopeful that the French division would get to break-even over the next two years. Tui has slashed the number of holidays it sells in France by 34%, mainly to Egypt and long-haul destinations. It also remains committed to its smaller operations in Spain and Italy. Investec analyst James Hollins said: \"Despite concerns over tough comparatives and the ongoing competitive threat of low cost carriers, online agencies and a resurgent Thomas Cook, Tui Travel is trading well into the winter season and has a sound operational base.\"",

Luckily, the commission on banking standards is on hand to provide exhibits that can still shock four years after HBOS's failure. Here is the bank's former chairman, Lord Stevenson, writing to the head of the Financial Services Authority on 18 March 2008, two days after the collapse of Bear Stearns in the US, an event that provided firm evidence that the credit crisis was intensifying and far from over: \"The bottom line is that without wishing to be the slightest bit complacent, we feel that HBOS in this particular storm and given its business characteristics is in as safe a harbour as is possible while at the same time feeling commercially rather frustrated!\" Ho, ho! Six months later HBOS was a crock, awaiting rescue by Lloyds TSB and the UK government. Frustration became humiliation. As Lord Lawson put it on Tuesday, Stevenson was being either dishonest or delusional when he wrote that letter. It was a mischievous remark because the \"cloud cuckoo land\" theory is clearly the one to prefer as it is all too easy to believe that Stevenson lacked the imagination to consider that wholesale markets could freeze, as they did after Lehman failed in September that year.

In his case, he was also being incentivised like an executive as he enjoyed share awards worth 100% of salary every year. That was highly controversial, even at the time, as chairmen are meant to be independent. Did it also contribute to the delusional group-think on the HBOS board?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Stevenson, former chairman of HBOS, was accused of being \"delusional\" and living in \"cloud cuckoo land\" during heated exchanges with peers and MPs about his \u00a3735,000 a year role at the bank, which nearly collapsed in 2008. Stevenson, who has led government reviews and once chaired publisher Pearson, was described as \"evasive, repetitive and unrealistic\" during Tuesday's gruelling three-and-a-half hour session with the parliamentary commission on banking standards. He apologised for the impact of the collapse of the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds and which in turn needed a \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. During a defensive appearance before the committee at which he refused to acknowledge any problems with the bank's board, Stevenson said he \"felt awful\" that the board had failed to foresee the \"protracted\" closure of the wholesale markets on which the bank relied for funding. While he admitted the \"true level of risk\" may not have been appreciated and that there had been \"mistaken\" lending, the crossbench peer took issue with parts of the damning report by the Financial Services Authority into the bank's corporate division. The division's former head, Peter Cummings, has been fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from working in the City. Cummings, who has given evidence to the committee in private due to his ill health, was described by Stevenson as an \"open and honest guy who's had a very tough time\". Cummings is the only former HBOS executive to be banned by the FSA, whose report Stevenson described as \"completely shocking\". \"I hated it,\" he said. He took issue with assertions by the FSA that auditors had raised concerns about the corporate division and that there had been a culture of optimism \u2013 \"The FSA got it plain wrong,\" he said. But he did agree the watchdog had been \"right to suggest that the corporate division grew too quickly\". Stevenson, who grew hoarse during the testy exchanges, irritated members of the commission, who include former chancellor Lord Lawson and the new archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, by his insistence that the main problem was the failure to predict wholesale markets would dry up for a year. He told Welby: \"We failed to plan for catastrophe \u2026 we were not aware until very late in 2008 that we were suffering from a heart attack.\" HBOS's loan-to-deposit ratio \u2013 a measure of reliance on markets rather than savers to fund lending \u2013 had grown from 140% to 196%. \"What brought the bank down was the closure of the wholesale markets. The day after Lehman that was it,\" said Stevenson, who oversaw the takeover by Lloyds three days after the US bank collapsed. Lawson said: \"You're living in cloud cuckoo land aren't you? Reckless growth led you into difficulties.\" He accused him of being either \"dishonest\" or \"delusional\" for describing the bank as \"a highly conservative institution\" in a letter to Sir Callum McCarthy, the then chairman of the FSA, in March 2008, days before speculators nearly brought down the bank. Stevenson eventually conceded that \"with the wisdom of hindsight I wished the pace of asset growth\" had been slower in 2006. He also insisted that there was no evidence of \"reckless\" growth. He pleaded that the inquiry was \"testing an ageing\" memory of events that took place up to 11 years ago but seeming to contradict himself, later said: \"There are very few days I don't think about it [the collapse of the bank]. I'm extremely sorry that it happened, I'm extremely sorry for the employees that got hit, the taxpayer that got hit and the shareholders who got hit.\" Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, pressed him repeatedly on whether the lending by the bank, which incurred \u00a326bn of losses on corporate loans, was \"competent\". Under pressure, Stevenson said: \"There must have been some that was incompetent and most was competent.\" Tyrie told Stevenson that he believed he was \"delusional rather than mendacious\". But he concluded: \"You've been evasive, repetitive and unrealistic.\" Asked if he would be regarded as \"fit and proper\" by the FSA to run a bank, Stevenson replied: \"I don't know.\" He had remained authorised as a non-executive director at private equity company Loudwater until last week. Stevenson was also taken to task over his assertion that he was a non-executive chairman of the bank after its formation from the merger between Halifax and Bank of Scotland in 2001 until its rescue by Lloyds in 2008. In fact he had told the FSA in a letter in January 2007: \"Yes I am part-time (but not non-executive). I am legally responsible for the business.\" His pay was unusual for a non-executive chairman as he also had a long-term incentive plan equivalent to his \u00a3735,000 a year salary. He told Tyrie he had lost money when the bank's share price collapsed as he had been buying shares in the runup to its near demise because he believed the shares were \"too cheap\". What Lord Stevenson said to the FSA in January 2008 \"I can understand a mind set which regards a 'non-executive chairman' as sailing above the battle, not concerned with the detailed day to day realities \u2026 Can I make it quite plain that I do not regard myself as that kind of a chairman.\" \"Yes, I am part-time (but not non-executive). l am legally responsible \u2026 knowledgeable and well briefed.\" What Stevenson said to the FSA in March 2008 (He was responding to an inquiry from the watchdog about HBOS's position, two days after the collapse of Bear Stearns. HBOS shares were plunging) \"We have had no problems in financing ourselves \u2026 even on the hairiest of days.\" \"I am not aware of any lurking horrors in our business or our balance sheet. Quite the reverse.\" \"How would we fare if liquidity completely dried up, you asked. Does that keep me awake at night? The answer is no!\" What Stevenson said on Tuesday \"It is clear, with the benefit of hindsight, that the bank did become exposed to excessive levels of risk.\" \"As a non-executive chairman, I did not experience the executive challenge \u2026 first hand.\" \"There are very few days I don't think about it [the collapse of the bank].\" \"I'm extremely sorry that it happened, I'm extremely sorry for the employees that got hit, the taxpayer that got hit and the shareholders who got hit.\" \"We failed to plan for catastrophe \u2026 We were not aware until very late in 2008 that we were suffering from a heart attack\". \"We failed, along with rest of the world, to anticipate the protracted closure of wholesale market.\" \"The worries we had were long-term worries. Had we thought for a moment there would be protracted closure of wholesale markets, we'd have been forced to take action.\"",

While the Belgians argue that the price of a beer in France will rise by 20%, from \u20ac4 to \u20ac5 a glass, French figures point to an increase of only about 25 cents for a standard bottle.</p>",

Parliament in Paris is to vote before Christmas on government proposals to increase excise on beer by 160%, a tax the Belgians say is discriminatory and protectionist with a potentially calamitous impact on sales and jobs. \"It will weigh heavily on employment, directly and indirectly,\" said Theo Vervloet, head of the Belgian Brewers Federation. \"This price increase will have an impact on investment in the brewing sector, one of the three top investors in the food industry.\" The dispute turned political when the Belgian prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, raised the issue with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace but was given short shrift. Frictions between Brussels and Paris have grown as a result of Hollande's campaign to raise taxes and cut spending amid signs that French billionaires and celebrities might seek a fiscal haven across the border to avoid a 75% tax on the super-rich. After being pressed on the beer tax by the Belgian leader, Hollande said: \"We are just as attentive to all the fiscal rules which may apply in Belgium.\" The Belgian upper house, or senate, has urged the prime minister to raise the beer excise with the French president and also called on the government to take the dispute to the European commission, arguing that the French move was aimed at shifting alcohol consumption in France away from beer to its mighty domestic wine industry. Di Rupo told Hollande Belgium had increased excise on wine by \"only\" 12%, while France was increasing the tax on beer by 160%. The French say the beer money will raise \u20ac480m in revenue to be spent on social services, with ministers contending that the decision has been taken on health grounds and to curb binge-drinking among the young. The Belgians complain that about a fifth of that revenue will accrue from their beer. \"The most remarkable aspect is the discriminatory, protectionist nature of this decision,\" said the Belgian Brewers' Federation. \"By contrast, there is almost no excise on wine and no increase is planned.\" The French increase keeps excise on beer low, at about a quarter of that levied in Britain. While the Belgians argue that the price of a beer in France will rise by 20%, from \u20ac4 to \u20ac5 a glass, French figures point to an increase of only about 25 cents for a standard bottle.",

Paris insists on all banks, the Germans want to restrict the scope to keep the eurozone supervisor away from its scores of small local savings and development banks.</p> <p>&#xa0;The likelihood here is of a fudge, say diplomats in Brussels. Formally the ECB will be empowered to supervise and regulate some 6,000 eurozone banks, but in practice it will leave much of the supervision with national authorities while focusing on the big and the problematic.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The second big issue concerns Britain</strong>, outside the eurozone and seeking jealously to guard its single market rights and the interests of The City against ECB domination and eurozone caucusing when voting on new rules and regulations.</p> <p>&#xa0;The dispute has been worsened this week by demands from France\u2019s central bank chief, Christan Noyer, that London no longer be the biggest financial centre on matters euro \u2013 a call that the British see as protectionist, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDirigisme&amp;ei=PMa9UK-uHsqZhQfbiIDgCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgG9guh9EyAFCS1rpcWPYnaN16ww\">dirigiste</a>, anti-single market and utterly in line with traditional French ambitions and policies.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The third issue revolves around how those not in the euro but eventually intending to join relate to the new supervisor \u2013 the east Europeans and the Swedes.</strong></p> <p>&#xa0;Non-euro countries coming under the ECB supervision would be given seats and votes on the banking supervisory board, but legally the ECB\u2019s governing council whose remit extends solely to the 17 single currency countries remains the paramount authority.</p> <p>&#xa0;There is an intractable problem here, but diplomats and officials think the circle can be squared with a bit of legal craftiness.</p> <p>&#xa0;Behind all of this, there is the politics. The Germans and the Swedes would be happy to see the ECB and the supervisory authority more formally separate. That could mean opening the Lisbon Treaty and renegotiating \u2013 a Pandora\u2019s Box.</p> <p>Taking this route would effectively delay the \u201cbanking union\u201d, possibly for years. That may precisely be the aim of Berlin and Stockholm.</p> <p>There is a growing consensus, however, that the finance ministers should settle the disputes themselves to avoid the topic being passed up the food chain to government leaders next week. The leaders decided last June to fast-forward towards the banking supervisor, then dumped the hard work on the finance ministries.</p> <p>Finance ministers are said to be fed up with their leaders and are keen to keep control themselves of the ticky banking supervision agenda, hence the likelihood of another Ecofin session within a week if there is no deal today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50bdc24295cb52bb16ba917d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-04T09:34:21.146Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris: euro is a calamitous project</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>London mayor Boris Johnson is giving a speech on Europe, and Britain's place in it, at <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trnewsmaker/\">Reuters London HQ</a> this morning.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/dec/04/boris-johnson-europe-speech-live-blog\">Our Politics Live blog</a> is tracking all the details.</p> <p>So far, Boris has damned the euro as \"a calamitous project\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Exactly as foretold, its one-size fits all monetary policy has<br> become a lethal engine that simultaneously trebuchets German goods across the euro zone, while deepening the misery for the peripheral countries whose unit labour costs make it hard for them to compete.</p> </blockquote> <p>Boris also attacks closer fiscal and political union in Europe as \"anti-democratic\" and \"probably morally wrong.</p> <p>But rather than quit the EU, he argues that Britain needs a looser relationship with Brussels:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boil it down to the single market.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel looks suitably moved after being re-elected as party leader with almost 98% of the vote. Busy day tomorrow, with the Autumn Statement in the UK and Ireland's austerity budget. So as the Ecofin meeting has ended, I'm going to scarper. Thanks for reading, and for the comments (witty captions and all). Goodnight! The press conference ends with Olli Rehn urging finance ministers to resolve the issues around banking supervision when they meet again next week. Rehn said: I call on all EU member states to approach the matter of a single banking supervisor with constructive spirit. That sounds like a clear signal to Paris and Berlin to sort the issue out. Journalists are asking about the question of Cyprus's potential bailout (as mentioned at 4.32pm). Is there a risk of the country running out of funds? Finance minister Vassos Shiarly insists that Cyprus can meet its obligations over the next couple of months. And Olli Rehn says that the Cypruys this is 'work in progress', adding: There is no problem meeting the financing needs of Cyprus in the short term. Olli Rehn also confirms that Malta has been removed from the EU's excessive deficit procedure process. However, plenty of other countries are still running deficits that are higher than Brussels would like. Olli Rehn is now speaking in Brussels, starting with a joke that Ecofin had maintained its \"record-breaking\" run, having lasted twice as long as yesterday's Eurogroup meeting. Commissioner Rehn says that he believes \"all the elements for a deal\" on a single supervisory framework for European banking union can be found in the compromise proposal drawn up by the Cypriot presidency. Rehn also insists that a deal must be reached by the end of 2012, saying: This is a test that Europe cannot afford to fail, and one that Europe must be more than capable of passing. That's rather how he described the challenge of reaching a deal on Greece's aid! Vassos Shiarly adds that European finance minister agreed to give Greece a two-year extension in which to hit its debt targets (in line with the deal hammered out by the eurogroup a week ago). He also tells reporters that ministers agreed to close their excessive deficit procedure against Malta. At the Ecofin press conference, Cypriot Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly speaks first - saying that ministers had 'extensively discussed' the issue of banking supervision. Shiarly says there has been some progress: We have almost reached an agreement, apart from a small number of articles... and confirms that another Ecofin meeting will be held on December 12. The Ecofin press conference is starting now - it's being streamed here. The DPA news agency has an interesting take on the question of the next president of the eurogroup - it reckons that the finance ministers of Germany and France might share the job, followed by the leaders of the Netherlands and Finland. I mentioned earlier (see 12.43pm) that Austria's finance minister had argued that the job should go to a European leader. However, I can't find anything in the Lisbon Treaty that insists on this. Indeed, the FT's Peter Spiegel suggested Finnish prime minister Jyrki Katainen as a front-runner earlier today: Peter adds that there might be a hitch, though -- Olli Rehn (the commissioner in charge of the euro) is also Finnish. Other countries might not approve of two Finns in such powerful jobs... The Ecofin meeting has ended in Brussels (without a deal on banking supervision, of course). A press conference is expected shortly, and will be streamed here. The EU has released a video this afternoon, explaining why it won the Nobel Peace prize (ahead of the actual ceremony next week). It starts with scenes from the second world war, and Winston Churchill's call that: We must build a kind of United States of Europe. and goes on to recognise many of the pioneers of European integration, including Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet and Jaques Delors, interspersed with interviews with European citizens. I found it rather moving, and strangely the lack of subtitles doesn't seem to matter. A slow day in the financial markets has ended with the main indices broadly unchanged (although Italy managed a decent rally). The deadlock in Brussels over banking supervision has not caused any alarm: FTSE 100: down 2 points at 5869, -0.04% German DAX: down 9.9 points at 7425, -0.13% French CAC: up 10 points at 3577, +0.3% Spain's IBEX: up 13 points at 7902, + 0.17% Italian FTSE MIB: up 165 points at 16041, +1% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said there was \"ongoing nervousness\" over the US fiscal cliff negotiations, adding: In such an environment, rumours usually flourish, and today has been no exception, with downgrade suggestions for Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Moody's, incidentally, is refusing to comment on that rumour (see 4.08pm). It appears Cyprus is getting closer to finalising its bailout, with reports that the country's president will address the nation tonight: Earlier today, Cyprus's finance minister said that a deal had been reached with European lenders. Anton Siluanov told reporters that : Cyprus has agreed with European lenders on its own so I think it may not require Russian loans. The negotiations haven't been easy though, given concern that much of the billions needed by Cyprus's banks would end up with \"Russian gangsters\" who have stashed money there. Rumour alert. There's a certain amount of chatter in the City this afternoon that Moody's is about to downgrade Germany (and possibly the Netherlands and Luxembourg as well). Analysts and traders aren't convinced that there's much in it (indeed, the Germany downgrade rumour flared up this morning, after an analyst told German TV that he wouldn't be surprised if  ). US investor Douglas Kass, for example, is playing it down: Usually these rumours come to nothing. Not always, though \u2013 governments do get a day's warning of a rating chance, so there can be a leak. As Joe Bond, vice president of Trading at Abshire Smith, reminds us: Back to Brussels, where French officials are blaming Germany for the failure to agree the legislative framework for eurozone banking supervision. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici remains positive, though. Ian Traynor has the details: Ian also reports that journalists raised the issue of the soon-to-be-vacant eurogroup presidency: Angela Merkel says she's \"flabbergasted and moved\" by the news that 98% of CDU party members voted to re-elect her as chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). News from Hanover -- Angela Merkel has swept to victory in the ballot to re-elect the CDU's leader: The chancellor's victory wasn't in doubt, of course, but the size of the win is worth noting -- despite criticism over her handling of the crisis Merkel clearly retains the support of her party. The Bank of Canada has left interest rates unchanged at 1% -- disappointing anyone who hoped for fireworks from Mark Carney, the next man to run Britain's central bank. In a statement, the BoC said it expects to start a \"modest withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus...over time\" (a repeat of last month's statement). Incidentally, Australia cut its interest rates this morning by a quarter-point, but at 3% its borrowing costs are much higher than Europe or the UK. All is not well in the state of Slovenia, where violent demonstrations took place last night for the third time in a fortnight. John Hooper, our Southern Europe Editor, reports on the situation in the euro zone\u2019s fifth-smallest nation (which has a population of just two million): Twelve people were injured and more than 40 arrested during a protest in Maribor, the country\u2019s second-biggest city. At the end of last week, there was rioting in the capital, Ljubljana, where police using tear gas and water cannon battled rock-throwing demonstrators. By the time the dust had settled, 15 people were injured and another 30 in custody. This sort of thing just should not be happening in a choc box-pretty Alpine state much favoured by honeymooners \u2013 let alone one that, until a few years ago, was considered a paragon of post-communist development. But then that is the magic of the euro zone crisis for you (Slovenia adopted the single currency in 2007). The protests are ostensibly against graft. Maribor\u2019s mayor, Franc Kangler, has refused to step down even though he has been accused of corruption and slung out of his party. Slovenia\u2019s centre-right prime minister, Janez Jansa, is on trial charged with involvement in bribery. There is plenty of evidence that Slovenia\u2019s economic miracle, which saw its GDP more than quadruple in the 15 years from 1993 to 2008 hid a fair amount of graft (as well as some very dubious lending that has landed the country in a classic credit crunch). But with many of its euro zone trading partners in recession, Slovenia would doubtless have felt the draught anyhow. It has to contend with one of Europe\u2019s deepest downturns. National output is off by more than 9% from its peak and, to avoid having to seek a bail-out, the government is imposing a tough programme that includes a deferment of the retirement age, labour market reforms and public-sector wage cuts. It's official - European finance ministers have failed to reach a deal over a banking supervisor for the eurozone. Pierre Moscovici has just told reporters in Brussels that another Ecofin meeting will take place on 12 December (that's next Wednesday). As Europe editor Ian Traynor explains, there has to be a deal before EU leaders begin their two-day summit on Thursday 13th. The talks failed for the reasons that we've been banging on about in the blog all morning (Ian's 9.48am post explains the main hurdles). In a euro-sized nutshell, France and Germany are simply too divided over how the eurozone's banks should be regulated. Paris wants every bank in the region to be covered by the new regulator, and full banking union as soon as possible. Berlin does not want smaller banks (such as its own savings banks) to be overseen, and is also in no rush to see banking union. Wolfgang Schauble suggested today that treaty changes might be needed - which would delay things for years. Behind Germany's refusal to cave in is the fear that it will foot the bill for future banking losses in weaker members of the eurozone. A delay gives more time to implement the tighter budget controls that German politicians believe are necessary to keep those peripheral countries in line. Austria's finance minister has declared that the next president of the eurogroup should be a head of government, following the example of Jean-Claude Juncker (see 8.07am for details of his decision to vacate the role) Asked if she might fancy the job, Maria Fekter replied: That's a position for a head of government and as you know I'm not a head of government. The bosses will decide how they want to handle this. Unusually, Juncker was prime minister and minister for finance when he took on the eurogroup presidency in 2005. Obviously this is not the case for two likely front-runners - Wolfgang Schauble or Pierre Moscovici. I'm struggling to think of a sensible suggestion for a head of government who could run the eurogroup. Elio Di Rupo of Belgium perhaps? As Lorcan Roche Kelly, chief Europe strategist at Trend Macrolytics points out, many leaders are too busy: Lorcan also suggests that Di Rupo could be a plausible successor. Incidentally, I suggested that Juncker's reign would be remembered for all those late night meetings where nothing ever seemed to get resolved. Kostas Karkagiannis, journalist at Greece's Kathimerini newspaper, has a more charitable view: Some photos of Angela Merkel's speech to her party convention (see 11.18am) just landed. They show that the chancellor rallied the CDU rank-and-file alongside large German and European flags: And here's the full quote from Merkel about how the worst of the crisis may not be over: I could take it easy and say the euro is saved....But I am very cautious about saying the worst of the crisis is over. As well as warning against complacency, Merkel also told the convention that Germany needs \"a clear compass\" to guide it through the challenges ahead (wonder how that will play at the polls...) On the economics front...German exports rose by 3.6% in the third quarter of this year, with strong demand from the US helping to offset the impact of the eurozone crisis. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik explains: Exports to countries outside the EU rose by 9.9% compared with a year ago, helping to offset the decline of deliveries into the euro zone. Exports to the US jumped sharply, with year-on-year growth of almost 26%, Korea followed with a 16% increase. Deliveries to countries outside the EU now make up around 44% of total German exports. The ongoing euro zone crisis hampered sales of German goods, which fell by 0.9 % to countries in the 27 EU member states and by 3.0 % to the euro zone. Exports to Spain dropped by around 13 % and to Italy by around 12 %. Exports to the UK were an exception, though, rising by almost 14%. However UK exports into Germany were down by 7% compared with a year earlier. According to the Federation of German Wholesale, BGA, also reported Germany's exports broke through the \u20ac1 trillion mark at the end of November. German newspaper Spiegel has hailed the US economy for rescuing German exports (thanks to northland for flagging up in the comments below). From Brussels, Ian Traynor confirms that France and Germany are deeply divided over banking union (less than two weeks after falling out over the EU budget at the last summit) Ian writes; Amid the worst Franco-German frictions for years over Europe, both countries\u2019 finance ministers have been keen to radiate common purpose in recent weeks and engage in damage limitation. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Pierre Moscovici made a joint appearance before the European Parliament on Monday while also appearing together before the media following a recent EU ministerial session. The gloves came off today, though, with both men clashing utterly on the fundamentals of the eurozone\u2019s proposed banking supervisor. Sch\u00e4uble said there was no way that the European Central Bank could supervise 6,000 banks in the eurozone, while Moscovici retorted there was no way the eurozone could introduce a \u201cdual\u201d system of banking supervision, meaning some are monitored at the eurozone level, while others (mainly German) stay under a national regime. These may be opening shots in the long and bloody battle to reach agreement. \u201cA game of two halves,\u201d said an EU official. Or they may represent an unbridgeable divide. The River Rhine just seems to get wider and wider. Angela Merkel has warned that the worst of the eurozone crisis may still be ahead, in a speech to her party convention in Hanover. Merkel also told CDU members that Germany had \"kept its promise\" exit the crisis stronger, and also cut unemployment despite the downturn. Reuters is now flashing a headline that a deal on banking supervision is 'unlikely today' (as our own Ian Traynor reported earlier - see 9.48am). Interestingly, they also reckon that Ecofin might meet again on 12 December for further talks. That would be the day before the next EU summit. Over in Hanover, Germany's governing CDU party is holding its national party convention. Merkel is expected to be re-elected as leader with a large majority, and will want to rally the troops as next autumn's general election approaches. Gerd Langguth, a political scientist at Bonn University and biographer of the chancellor, predicts \"a big Merkel show,\". He told Reuters: Calling it a cult is too much, but she is very popular in the broader population. In the CDU, she is more respected than loved. Not by everyone, though -- union members dressed up in Santa Claus outfits outside the arena to call for a minimum wage of \u20ac8.50 per hour: In the Franco-German tiff over the scope of the eurozone banking supervisor (see 9.48am megapost), Paris is now accusing Berlin of seeking a \u201ctwo-speed\u201d system which the French say has to be avoided at all costs. A senior French official told Ian Traynor: This is the most sensitive point. A balance has still to be found. A large majority [of governments] wants the small banks to remain under national supervision. That\u2019s not France\u2019s position, but realistically France would accept that with two reservations: there must be no impact on the single market, small banks are defined as those not carrying out any cross-border operations; the ECB retains responsibility for the entire banking system and can supervise any bank at its discretion. We need to avoid a two-speed system at all costs. The official added: The problem is Germany also says it wants to avoid a two-speed system but all the changes it is proposing go in exactly the opposite direction. We need clarification from the Germans. Germany is a bit isolated here. Going into today\u2019s meeting, Michel Barnier, the French politician in charge of drafting the banking regulation law as European Commissioner for the single market, also said there should be no two-tier system, Ian reports. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor confirms that it appears there will not be a breakthrough today on a new eurozone banking supervisor. Here's the full story (long, but well worth it) Ian writes: Already, despite pre-session optimism from the Germans, French, and British, the signals are that there will be no breakthrough today ahead of next week's EU summit. Senior sources tell me the ministers are already talking of calling another so-called Ecofin meeting within days, ahead of the summit on Thursday next week, not least because several of the ministers are keen to keep control of the complex issue and not hand it over to chancellors, president, and prime ministers. There are three big issues: \u2022 the scope of the new supervisor which is to be the European Central Bank. Essentially this is a Franco-German tiff over which and how many banks come under the ECB remit. Paris insists on all banks, the Germans want to restrict the scope to keep the eurozone supervisor away from its scores of small local savings and development banks. The likelihood here is of a fudge, say diplomats in Brussels. Formally the ECB will be empowered to supervise and regulate some 6,000 eurozone banks, but in practice it will leave much of the supervision with national authorities while focusing on the big and the problematic. \u2022 The second big issue concerns Britain, outside the eurozone and seeking jealously to guard its single market rights and the interests of The City against ECB domination and eurozone caucusing when voting on new rules and regulations. The dispute has been worsened this week by demands from France\u2019s central bank chief, Christan Noyer, that London no longer be the biggest financial centre on matters euro \u2013 a call that the British see as protectionist, dirigiste, anti-single market and utterly in line with traditional French ambitions and policies. \u2022 The third issue revolves around how those not in the euro but eventually intending to join relate to the new supervisor \u2013 the east Europeans and the Swedes. Non-euro countries coming under the ECB supervision would be given seats and votes on the banking supervisory board, but legally the ECB\u2019s governing council whose remit extends solely to the 17 single currency countries remains the paramount authority. There is an intractable problem here, but diplomats and officials think the circle can be squared with a bit of legal craftiness. Behind all of this, there is the politics. The Germans and the Swedes would be happy to see the ECB and the supervisory authority more formally separate. That could mean opening the Lisbon Treaty and renegotiating \u2013 a Pandora\u2019s Box. Taking this route would effectively delay the \u201cbanking union\u201d, possibly for years. That may precisely be the aim of Berlin and Stockholm. There is a growing consensus, however, that the finance ministers should settle the disputes themselves to avoid the topic being passed up the food chain to government leaders next week. The leaders decided last June to fast-forward towards the banking supervisor, then dumped the hard work on the finance ministries. Finance ministers are said to be fed up with their leaders and are keen to keep control themselves of the ticky banking supervision agenda, hence the likelihood of another Ecofin session within a week if there is no deal today. London mayor Boris Johnson is giving a speech on Europe, and Britain's place in it, at Reuters London HQ this morning. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the details. So far, Boris has damned the euro as \"a calamitous project\": Exactly as foretold, its one-size fits all monetary policy has become a lethal engine that simultaneously trebuchets German goods across the euro zone, while deepening the misery for the peripheral countries whose unit labour costs make it hard for them to compete. Boris also attacks closer fiscal and political union in Europe as \"anti-democratic\" and \"probably morally wrong. But rather than quit the EU, he argues that Britain needs a looser relationship with Brussels: Boil it down to the single market. Scrap the social chapter. Scrap the fisheries policy. We could construct a relationship with the EU that more closely resembled that of Norway or Switzerland \u2013 except that we would be inside the single market council, and able to shape legislation. So, not a Brexit. More of a Breshape? Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports that eurozone finance ministers are already speculating that another meeting may be needed to hammer out the details of a legislative framework for eurozone banking supervision. Not an encouraging sign, especially with some nations suggesting it might take years before full banking union is achieved. The creation of a single eurozone banking supervisor is a key step towards full banking union, but the process has not been easy. In June EU leaders agreed to create a single banking regulation system for the eurozone, with a financial backstop, starting in January 2013. That was seen as a big step forward, but the deal soon began to unravel \u2013 and in October a compromise was reached - with leaders deciding to simply agree the details of a legislative framework that would begin at the start of next year. Today's meeting would be a success if ministers did hammer out that framework. The Ecofin meeting is underway in Brussels - here's a couple of early photos (I fear they won't give Hoth25 quite the same opportunity for witty captions) Euro crisis commentator Yannis Koutsomitis suggests: French finance minister Pierre Moscovici has indicated that he might be able to compromise with Germany over banking supervision. Speaking to reporters in Brussels at the start of today's Ecofin meeting, Moscovici said that France could relax its demand that every bank in the eurozone is covered by a new single supervisor: That might not be enough, though. Germany's smaller banks are adamant that they shouldn't face the same regulatory hurdles as international heavy hitters. As Michael Huber, head of the Karlsruhe Ettlingen savings bank, explained to the FT: You don\u2019t impose the safety rules you\u2019d need for a 2,000-passenger cruise ship on a yacht taking five people up the coast. There would be enormous administrative costs that I would have to pass on ... it would hit Mittelstand companies and the local economy. Just in - Spanish unemployment total has risen again. Spain's labour ministry reported that another 74,296 people registered as unemployed in November, a rise of 1.5%. That's the fourth monthly rise in a row - Spanish firms have been cutting headcount since the end of the summer tourist season. (this survey is separate to the unemployment data released by Eurostat last Friday, which put the Spanish jobless rate at 26.2%) Jean-Claude Juncker is finally stepping aside as president of the eurogroup. Luxembourg's prime minister told reporters late last night that he would end his seven years as the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers at the end of this month. The BBC has the quotes: I don't have to endorse anyone,\" Mr Juncker told reporters. \"I was asking my colleagues to provide for my succession. \"And I asked them to do everything possible to appoint another minister as chair of the Eurogroup.\" Likely successors are Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and France's Pierre Mosvovici - therewas speculation recently that the two men could even share the post.... Juncker's time at the eurogroup will probably be remembered for all those long meetings where eurozone ministers struggled to make progress towards resolving the crisis \u2013 and his affectionate manner with fellow ministers.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis - and other key events in the global economy. European finance ministers are gathering in Brussels this morning for an Ecofin meeting, where plans for banking supervision are top of the agenda. Analysts expect a bruising session, as ministers attempt to agree the details of a package setting up a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) for the eurozone's banking sector. France and Germany have been divided over the issue for months. They disagree over how many banks should be overseen by the new super-regulator (Paris wants all eurozone banks to be covered), and when the SSM should begin (Berlin isn't convinced that it should start early in 2013). So we might see a breakthrough, or it could be another meeting where little is achieved. Also coming up this morning, we have new Spanish unemployment data, a fresh survey of the UK construction sector, and an interest rate decision from Canada \u2013 which is rather more interesting now that Britain has poached their central banker...",

      "bodyText": "Up to 30 gas-fired power stations will have to be built across the country, ensuring that more gas will be produced in Britain by 2030 to guarantee energy supplies, the government will announce this week. Tax incentives and a new body to encourage the development of controversial shale gas will be unveiled as part of a new gas strategy which will be published alongside the chancellor's autumn statement . George Osborne, who is expected to admit that he will fail to meet his target of reducing debt as a share of GDP by 2015-16, will use his statement on Wednesday to claim he is committed to promoting economic growth when he outlines major reforms to the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). The chancellor, who will announce that the government is on course to save \u00a32.5bn in more than 100 PFI schemes, will speed up the process of procurement and give the taxpayer a minority stake in a new company overseeing the new model known as PF2. A Treasury source said: \"We'll be showing that we remain committed to solving today's problems but also preparing for tomorrow's challenges and equipping Britain in the global race.\" Osborne pledged in opposition to reform PFI, which was first used by Sir John Major's government, and was rapidly escalated under Tony Blair, to fund public sector infrastructure projects using private capital. Osborne, who said that the last government used PFI to play down the government's liabilities, will create a cap on \"off balance sheet\" liabilities. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, welcomed the PFI reform. She said: \"Today's announcement ends months of uncertainty for the industry by setting out a new model to channel private finance into the development of UK infrastructure. The pipeline of projects also offers good news for an under-pressure construction sector.\" The government will declare in its gas strategy that an extra 26 gigawatts of gas will have to be produced by 2030, which will require 30 new gas-fired power stations. Some of these will be created by modernising existing plants. The strategy will say: \"Both now and in the future we need a diverse generation mix that balances risks and uncertainties of different technology options \u2026 the government expects that gas will continue to play a major role in our electricity mix over the coming decades, alongside low-carbon technologies as we decarbonise our electricity system.\" The strategy will add: \"In 2030 we could need more overall gas capacity than we have today.\" The government will also announce that it is to consult on introducing tax incentives to encourage the production of shale gas and will create an Office for Unconventional Gas. This is designed to co-ordinate responsibilities across government. Davey is to make separate decisions on the highly controversial process of fracking to extract shale gas. The new gas strategy, which follows differences within the coalition over onshore windfarms, will prompt speculation that the Tories and Liberal Democrats are once again in disagreement over energy policy. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, told the Guardian recently that the Tories would try to \"big up\" gas when he unveils the new strategy on Wednesday. \"It's an over-used phrase,\" he said of the term dash for gas. \"We are some way off from thinking we have too much gas. I am quite relaxed about the gas strategy that will be published at time of the autumn statement. \"I am sure the Tories will big it up, but Liberal Democrats have always said gas has a role. If there is a danger that we are locking in too much gas, we will still have tools to reduce it.\" Lib Dem sources told the Guardian last night that they were relaxed about the new gas strategy even though it will signal an increase in the amount of gas. The sources said they were reasonably relaxed because the overall level of fossil fuels in the \"energy mix\" will fall because oil and coal, which are more expensive and more carbon intensive, will be reduced. Lib Dem also say that they are as keen as the Tories to ensure continuity of Britain's energy prices and to keep fuel bills down. Jesse Norman, the Conservative MP who advised Osborne in opposition, welcomed the announcement on PFI. He said: \"The PFI has become notorious for its cost, inflexibility and lack of transparency. It is very good news that the government's new PF2 is addressing all of these issues.\"",
