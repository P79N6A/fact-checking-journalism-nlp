      "bodyText": "Keynes had the right description for the state of Britain today when he said a depression was \"a chronic condition of subnormal activity for a considerable period without any marked tendency either towards recovery or towards collapse\". Every part of that statement applies to the UK. The economy has been operating at low levels of activity for five years and while there is no immediate sign of another slump there is no evidence of recovery either. Britain has achieved a form of stability, but it is the stability of the comatose. For the past three years, the treatment administered by the government has been a mixture of crash diet and happy pills. The rigour has come from the Treasury in the form of higher taxes and spending cuts, while the Bank of England has doled out the anti-depressants. It's time to change the medicine. George Osborne's original diagnosis of Britain's economic problems had merit. He was right to say that growth was far too dependent on debt. He was right to point out that Britain's public finances going into the crisis were far weaker than they should have been. All that said, the treatment has not worked. The past three years have seen weak growth, slippage on deficit reduction, zero evidence of rebalancing and the downgrade of Britain's credit rating that austerity was supposed to insure against. This Wednesday Osborne will deliver his fourth budget and has the opportunity to try something different. But changing course now would mean admitting that Ed Balls was right all along. Even worse, it would lay David Cameron open to the charge that he was the political reincarnation of the U-turning Ted Heath. So the rhetoric will remain the same. Osborne will say that the downgrade makes it even more imperative that there is no Treasury backsliding and will insist that budgetary rigour can allow the Bank to become even more activist in its approach. The expectation is that the package will be neutral, with every pound of giveaways matched pound for pound by takeaways. Financial markets know there will be headline-grabbing measures on Wednesday but believe the budget will neither stimulate the economy nor lead to demand contracting. Boosting growth will be left to the Bank of England. The results of four years of monetary activism from the Bank have been disappointing. Ultra-low interest rates have not done the trick, nor has \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing (QE) through the asset purchase scheme. Osborne feels he has been let down by King, who in the eyes of the chancellor has failed to deliver his side of the bargain. The hope is that under the new governor, Mark Carney, the economy will achieve \"escape velocity\". To achieve this, Carney looks likely to get the extra leeway he has sought. Osborne may announce a consultation into the Bank's remit, the legal mandate under which it independently conducts monetary policy. Suggestions include giving the Bank a longer period to bring inflation back to its 2% target, providing it with a dual inflation/growth target like the US Federal Reserve, or broadening the scope of the QE programme so that a wider range of assets, such as mortgages, could be purchased. Relying on the Bank to do the heavy lifting looks like the safe option. However, it is the wrong option and if he delivers the steady-as-she-goes package the City is braced for Osborne may regret it. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citibank, points out that Osborne has been chipping away at the UK's structural budget deficit by about 0.5% of GDP in the past two years. But in the next year (2013-14) the tightening will increase to 1% of GDP as a result of \"fiscal drag\", the phenomenon whereby the Treasury's revenue take rises because individuals move into higher tax brackets. With the economy as weak as it is, intensifying the squeeze is plain daft, and if the chancellor decides to maintain deficit reduction at the current 0.5%-a-year pace he could cut taxes or boost capital spending by \u00a38bn in the budget. It would not make that much difference to the economy but it would be a start. What's more, it would make Osborne look less like a doctor who refuses to change his treatment even when the patient is not getting better. The time is rapidly approaching when the patient can ask for a second opinion.",

With the UK struggling to grow, Europe continuing to flounder and the US in a relative sweet spot, intellectual consensus has swung sharply against austerity. But to paint the picture as a straight choice between austerity and growth is intellectually dishonest. The reality is that whatever plan is implemented to resolve the debt crisis, the effects will be painful. Simplistically pointing to the outperformance of the US economy as evidence that there is only one correct policy path is the wrong approach. We do not yet know how the Federal Reserve's policy will turn out \u2013 it might have a worse crisis in future as a result of current actions. US debt stands at almost $17 trillion, more than $50,000 (\u00a333,000) for every person in America. It is far too early to declare that the Fed is on the right path \u2013 it is simply following the strategy of governments of all political persuasions during the financial crisis and delaying the repayments. In a democratic system it is too tempting to use a future government's budget to buy favours now. Tomorrow is another day but it is also someone else's problem. Growth is an outcome, not a policy. The question is: how do we get there? Politicians would have us believe they have all the answers, but the truth is that there is no way out of the debt problem without someone picking up the tab. We can move debt from private-sector balance sheets to public, place the burden on savers rather than borrowers, start taxing wealth rather than income. But these are simply choices about allocation of the costs, not magic wands of wealth creation. Much research has been done on the problems of excessive debt for economies. Once the sovereign debt burden becomes too great (the tipping point appears to be around 90% of GDP), any attempt to service or reduce it becomes self-defeating. Currently, the UK's debt is 85% of GDP (although you can get to a lower figure depending on what debts you exclude). Cutting government spending or raising taxes to lower the deficit hurts growth (which increases the deficit). The recent poor performance of the UK economy has been seized upon by certain commentators as proof that an austerity-led approach is wrong. But that argument also implies that the \"spend and print\" path is correct. If wealth could be created by printing money, Zimbabwe would be the richest country in the world and schoolchildren would be learning about the Weimar economic miracle. The fact that \"spend and print\" seems so favoured by politicians suggests that they do not understand the cost of quantitative easing. In the 1970s \u00a3100,000 would buy you a mansion; now it might buy you a London parking space. That is ultimately how proponents of QE hope to solve the debt burden. But QE doesn't just attack debt; it also attacks the purchasing power of money. The debt is still being repaid; it is just being repaid in the form of accepting a lower standard of living for all. Instead of the government taking an extra 5p in the pound from your wages, it is making \u00a31 of goods cost \u00a31.05. What is the difference? A pound of direct taxation can be raised in any number of ways, through income, from corporate profits, mansion taxes \u2013 whatever takes the fancy of the government of the day. A pound of QE's indirect taxation manifests itself in the cost of goods, and that burden falls hardest on the people for whom these costs are the highest share of their disposable income, namely those with the lowest incomes. When people talk about inflating away the debt, they mean that savers should pay back the debt instead of borrowers. When people push for more QE, they are arguing for all members of society to pay back the debt incurred by a few. When Keynesians claim that deficit spending is imperative, they mean that current taxpayers should be supported at the expense of the future ones. This debate is about allocating the costs, not generating the wealth. There are no simple ways to create growth. Governments simply spending more money won't necessarily solve it. We could build a winding staircase made of gold a mile high and it would add to GDP, but it would still be non-productive. Spending the same money on an engineering college for students who do not want to incur tuition fees would be far more beneficial \u2013 but its effects would be slow to materialise. Politicians like to blur the line between spending and investment, but only one can ultimately help growth. But fiscal stimulus does not solely mean the government directly spending more money; it can also mean cutting taxes. Osborne could raise the tax-free allowance to \u00a315,000 to help those who are most negatively affected by QE; give tax breaks to companies that build factories here to take advantage of our weakening currency; and remove employers' national insurance contributions so that it is more attractive to hire workers. All those tax cuts should help stimulate growth. We tried spending our way to growth and blew up the economy. We have tried austerity but cannot get public spending to fall. Maybe it is time to try tax cuts. Dr Guy Wolf is global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron, a broker to the commodities sector.",

City wants Greggs to start slicing back stores Of all the measures George Osborne has been tempted to introduce this week, sticking VAT on freshly baked goods probably never attracted him.

Osborne doesn't talk much about that aborted effort these days, but the issue of Greggs and the odd store closure does recur \u2013 as we will likely hear this week when Roger Whiteside, the chief executive who is just a month into the job, has his first stab at a major results statement.
