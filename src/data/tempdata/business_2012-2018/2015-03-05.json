      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has warned that the next government must relax Whitehall spending budgets to support training and infrastructure projects in a move seen as taking the Liberal Democrats closer to Labour before the general election. In a speech in the City, the business secretary attacked the \u201carchaic\u201d way that public spending was controlled, calling for changes to boost areas such as skills training and new rail schemes. Aligning his view of public spending with Labour\u2019s chancellor Ed Balls, he said it was \u201cextraordinary and irrational\u201d that with government borrowing so cheap, there was not more public investment. He told a lord mayor\u2019s dinner at the Mansion House in the City of London on Thursday: \u201cOne obstacle is the archaic way we control public spending, which fails to make sufficient distinction between growth-enhancing capital investment and other public spending. \u201cThe idea that we should treat borrowing to fund long-term investment as if it was this week\u2019s wage bill makes little sense. One of the most significant commitments the next government should make is to maintain the discipline of deficit reduction, but continue to carve out capital spending in a way that is sensible and economically literate.\u201d He said a way of squaring the circle would be to classify \u201cproductive\u201d elements of expenditure as capital spending, rather than as day-to-day spending. The move would reclassify spending on roads and railways and investment in skills and innovation as investment in the \u201cfuture productive potential of the economy\u201d. Cable believes his pitch for higher capital spending falls somewhere between the Tory straitjacket and Labour\u2019s plan to allow extra capital expenditure within tightly drawn current spending constraints \u2013 in line with the coalition\u2019s projections. But Balls has yet to flesh out how much capital spending would be allowed should Labour win office. And Cable\u2019s demand for a broader definition of capital expenditure will distance the Lib Dems from the Tories and align them with the shadow chancellor\u2019s commitment to boost long-term infrastructure budgets. Cable added that business leaders should bring some sanity to the debate over Europe and the threat of a British withdrawal. He said reforming the European Union before a referendum could take years to negotiate, which could hit business investment decisions. Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI, said pledges to hold a referendum on EU membership and restrict migration were damaging. Rake, who is chairman of BT and deputy chairman of Barclays, said: \u201cDriving growth isn\u2019t about an either/or choice, but about being open to all opportunities, at home and abroad. We need to attract global talent and up-skill our population here in the UK. \u201cWe need to embrace the EU\u2019s single market, turning each British customer into seven European ones, and look to new opportunities in emerging markets. \u201cImmigration has been, and will continue to be, part of the solution to our skills shortages whilst net immigration targets will not work.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne finds wriggle room to provide budget giveaways", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At the time of last December\u2019s autumn statement, received wisdom in Westminster was that it marked the last major economic policy milestone before May\u2019s general election. There is no financial room for pre-election giveaways, the logic went; and, anyway, by the time the chancellor stands up at the dispatch box on 18 March, it would be far too late for any to make themselves felt in voters\u2019 pockets. Then the autumn statement lived up to its billing with a complete rewrite of the much-reviled stamp duty regime for house purchases \u2013 a heavy burden for first-time buyers. But George Osborne is a deeply political chancellor, who harbours aspirations to greater things, so it was always unlikely that he would let what might be his final budget pass without a flourish. And as the big day approaches, it seems the judgment that he had no cash to spare for pre-election lollipops may well have been premature. The public finances have been surprisingly well-behaved over recent months, as the upturn in the labour market finally starts to feed through to tax receipts, while other taxes, including VAT, come in strongly. The Treasury clocked up its biggest surplus in a single month for seven years in January: \u00a38.8bn, putting it well on course to achieve the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecast of an \u00a383bn deficit for the full financial year. Indeed, with some self-assessment receipts likely to have come in in February, Osborne may well beat that forecast, creating a little bit of short-term wriggle room. Looking forward, he is likely to benefit from stronger than expected economic growth. Forecasts have generally been revised up since the turn of the year, in part because of cheaper oil prices, and that tends to make the public finances healthier. As Goldman Sachs\u2019s Kevin Daly put it in a note earlier this week: \u201cThe news on economic activity and borrowing has been relatively positive since the autumn statement and we expect the OBR to revise its growth forecasts higher and its borrowing forecasts lower\u201d. In addition, lower-than-expected inflation, caused not by the chancellor\u2019s prudence but the plunging global oil price, cuts the repayments on inflation-linked government bonds, or gilts \u2013 a boon that could be worth up to \u00a34bn a year to the Treasury. In total, Daly expects the chancellor to have up to \u00a38bn more to spare in the current financial year than he expected before Christmas, and more than \u00a312bn for 2015-16. There\u2019s another piece of fiscal magic the chancellor could conjure up, too. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, points out that the Conservatives\u2019 spending plans, as published alongside the autumn statement (and repudiated by their Liberal Democrat coalition partners) allowed them to meet their fiscal targets by a wide margin: as much as \u00a323bn by the end of the forecast period in 2020. Osborne likes to make much play of his fiscal rectitude; but he could deflate that \u00a323bn safety cushion quite a bit without spooking the City \u2013 and without blurring the sharp dividing line between the Tories\u2019 aggressive deficit-cutting plans and Labour\u2019s more modest proposals. \u201cOne important implication of the autumn statement is that because it was tighter than it needed to be, there was already some scope for a giveaway,\u201d says Wells. There is considerable uncertainty about how the OBR will interpret the implications of lower oil prices for the economy; but it\u2019s likely to be good news for Osborne. Of course, a chancellor who has styled himself as the one man standing between Britain and the brink of a Greek-style financial crisis is unlikely to spend every extra penny he has to spare. But Osborne might be able to bring forward his promises to lift the personal tax allowance to \u00a312,000 by 2020, for example (cost: \u00a36bn a year) without blowing his plans too far off course. Or, given his penchant for political theatre, Osborne might offer something completely fresh, in a final bid to frame the political debate in the runup to polling day. Inheritance tax, council tax, business rates \u2014 all are ripe for a radical re-think, and all could win the coalition new friends, just when it needs them most.",

Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, points out that the Conservatives\u2019 spending plans, as published alongside the autumn statement (and repudiated by their Liberal Democrat coalition partners) allowed them to meet their fiscal targets by a wide margin: as much as \u00a323bn by the end of the forecast period in 2020.</p> <p>Osborne likes to make much play of his fiscal rectitude; but he could deflate that \u00a323bn safety cushion quite a bit without spooking the City \u2013 and without blurring the sharp dividing line between the Tories\u2019 aggressive deficit-cutting plans and Labour\u2019s more modest proposals.</p> <p>\u201cOne important implication of the autumn statement is that because it was tighter than it needed to be, there was already some scope for a giveaway,\u201d says Wells.</p> <p>There is considerable uncertainty about how the OBR will interpret the implications of lower oil prices for the economy; but it\u2019s likely to be good news for Osborne.</p> <p>Of course, a chancellor who has styled himself as the one man standing between Britain and the brink of a Greek-style financial crisis is unlikely to spend every extra penny he has to spare.</p> <p>But Osborne might be able to bring forward his promises to lift the personal tax allowance to \u00a312,000 by 2020, for example (cost: \u00a36bn a year) without blowing his plans too far off course.</p> <p>Or, given his penchant for political theatre, Osborne might offer something completely fresh, in a final bid to frame the political debate in the runup to polling day. Inheritance tax, council tax, business rates \u2014 all are ripe for a radical re-think, and all could win the coalition new friends, just when it needs them most.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Company bosses beware. If a shareholder grabs a selfie at your annual meeting this year they may well be from activist group ShareAction. The charity owns a share in every FTSE 100 company, enabling activists to turn up at AGMs and raise subjects from boardroom pay to climate change \u2013 and getting a shot with the chief executive is just one way of getting their protests noticed. It is advice like this that ShareAction handed out at an activists\u2019 bootcamp last month and with this year\u2019s annual meeting season about to get underway, Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, is running a series of sessions. Company meetings are \u201can opportunity to put the issues on the agenda of the entire board of directors,\u201d she tells her audience. \u201cYou open the door for further dialogue\u201d. To illustrate the power of the well placed question she recalls the annual meeting of HSBC back in 2003. That is when Abdul Durrant, an \u201cinvisible night cleaner\u201d stood up and asked the then chairman Sir John Bond if the bank would pay the living wage. It caused even more of stir coming just after Bond had had to defend a $37m (\u00a324m) pay deal for new board member, William Aldinger III. Although it took place before ShareAction was set up, under the name FairPensions, a decade ago, it marked a moment in shareholder activism and motivated Howarth. \u201cWhen Aldinger moved on to the HSBC board his pay package included \u00a318,000 a year for dental care \u2013 which was more than cleaning staff were getting on the minimum wage. It was very powerful,\u201d she said. It shows the publicity \u2013 and potential results \u2013 that activists can grasp on the one occasion a year when boardroom bosses, from the chief executive to the part-time non-executive, must face their shareholders to be elected to the board, have their strategies endorsed and their pay deals approved. ShareAction is likely to be at around 80 annual meetings this year, including those held by some of the biggest British companies, including BP, in April where Howarth was involved in tabling a resolution to improve transparency on climate change exposure that has been backed by the board. HSBC\u2019s meeting in May is likely to be a particularly bad-tempered event after the revelations about the tax avoidance activities in its Swiss private bank. The aim of the training sessions is to better equip debut AGM attendees to ask questions that will elicit a clear reply and the best possible publicity for their cause. As attendees introduce themselves at the session, they list a diverse range of interests \u2013 from access for disabled people, zero hours contracts and surveillance issues to the perenially thorny topic of soaring executive pay. They are asked to draw up their questions for a mock board of directors. One activist, Susan Cook, proceeds to skewer the imaginary board of a fashion retailer about the problems disabled people face in getting acces to the lifts in its stores. Sitting in her wheelchair, she gets her point across the more forcefuly when she points out the shop she could not get into was the flagship store on London\u2019s Oxford Street. It is the turn of former City fund manger Anne-Marie Williams, who asks an imaginary board of directors at Sports Direct about zero hours contracts. Williams is now volunteering for ShareAction. Next Jenny Luckett, policy and communications officer at Generation Rent, challenges a make believe board of estate agents about fees charged to renters. David Weeks, playing the role of the chairman of the imaginary companies, tells everyone that annual meetings are not just just good for publicity, but also an unrivalled opportunity to network with the board. \u201cThe board has to use it as a damage limitation exercise ...[You\u2019ve] got an opportunity to get on the map,\u201d said Weeks. But hang around the lunch and shareholders can reiterate their point in private too. Weeks, who is on the committee of the Association of Member Nominated Trustees \u2013 the pensions governance support group \u2013 has begun attending company AGMs because he thinks trustees should take a much greater interest in how votes are cast. While AGMs are the one time a year when boardroom bosses must face their shareholders in public, they will have met their biggest investors on numerous occasions behind closed doors. The attendeesby contrast are often individual investors with a small number of shares and their actual votes on resolutions count for little when the powerful City investors have already cast theirs by proxy. Howarth warned the training session that quite often \u201cthere is a range of quite angry questions on pay, followed by a vote in which 95% of shareholders approve pay. That\u2019s because all the really big institutional investors, who are rarely in the room [have already cast their votes in favour]\u201d. Even so, smaller investors can get their voices heard by speaking at the meeting, while Howarth said she talks to big City investors to try to win their backing for the key points on the agenda of activists. She listed agms where ShareAction has helped shareholders to speak out: at Sainsbury\u2019s, for instance, over its advertising in the Sun despite its page three topless models; at Greggs, where campaigners asked about the welfare of the animals used to make the baker\u2019s famous sausage rolls. For would-be agm protesters, her tip sheet contains five points: keep the question short; use an appropriate tone (polite not hectoring); frame your question by turning the company\u2019s own words against them; know your audience; and lastly have a \u201cclear ask\u201d \u2013 that requires a firm commitment or a yes or no answer. \u201cIt is really important to read the mood in the room,\u201d Howarth says. Write down the question to read it out. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to dry up\u201d. Her colleague Jamie Audsley adds a last piece of advice: keep hold of the microphone. \u201cIn a respectful way you can get into a dialogue. You need to keep the audience on your side\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed at their highest level since November 2007, the early days of the financial crisis. FTSE 100: up 41 points at 6961, +0.6% German DAX: up 1% French CAC: up 0.9% Joost Van Leenders, chief economist of multi-asset solutions at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, says Mario Draghi reassured investors: \u201cHe showed his determination to stick with the programme and dismissed ... the problem (that sellers will be hard to find).... \u201cOverall that\u2019s positive for equities.\u201d And that\u2019s probably all for tonight. My summary of the ECB press conference is here. Rolling coverage starts here. And analyst reaction starts here. Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The ECB has focused attention back on Cyprus by holding this month\u2019s meeting in Nicosia. And while the island has outperformed Greece in implementing reforms \u2013 and is now on track to exit its \u20ac10bn euro bailout programme ahead of schedule - it still faces the threat of non-performing loans. Helena Smith reports: Prior to opening today\u2019s conference, ECB chief Mario Draghi warned that while Cyprus had made \u201cremarkable\u201d economic progress it was \u201cequally no time for complacency.\u201d Non-performing loans \u2013 at \u20ac23bn well in excess of the island\u2019s total output of \u20ac17bn - are still seen as the biggest obstacle to financing the local economy. At close to half of banks\u2019 total lending and still on the rise, they are also viewed as the greatest challenge to the Cypriot banking system. Draghi urged the government to impose legislation that would reduce NPLs (nearly a third of which are owned by individual borrowers). President Nikos Anastasiades government has drafted a foreclosure law but delayed enforcing it until an insolvency law is also passed to ensure that vulnerable borrowers - small- time entrepreneurs and home-owners \u2013 are protected. Across the board foreclosures could result in even greater financial chaos if the latter are hit. \u201cWith the exception of the NPLs, the Anastasides administration has been very eager, very nerdish about implementing what was asked of them by creditors,\u201d said Hubert Faustmann, associate professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \u201cWhile there has been some domestic resistance it has always been overcome.\u201d As the EU\u2019s only bailed out state to have forced its depositors to have shared the burden of a rescue \u2013 with the infamous \u201cbail in\u201d of accounts worth more than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 anger towards creditor bodies like the ECB is still rife (as Wednesday\u2019s night protests in Nicosia illustrated). But Cyprus\u2019 better-than-expected recovery has also shown that micro-economies are much more difficult to predict. \u201cThey can be much more influenced by events, very little can do a lot of good,\u201d said Faustmann calling Cyprus \u201cthe north of the south.\u201d \u201cPeople here are hard working,\u201d he insisted, adding: \u201cElite corruption, though endemic, is far less destructive than it is, say in Greece, and the mentality has many western European traits partly as a result of the British legacy albeit mixed with Mediterranean and oriental values.\u201d Why is Mario Draghi like Diego Maradona? Read Heather Stewart\u2019s analysis to find out: ECB meeting: Mario Draghi is upbeat but eurozone risks remain Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, says Mario Draghi is responsible for the euro plumbing new 12-year lows this afternoon: When President Draghi revealed that there would be a cap on the QE program \u2013 the ECB would not buy bonds whose yields were below the interest rate corridor floor of -0.20% - the Euro hit the skids. Perhaps this is an indication that market participants feel there simply won\u2019t be ample supply of short-dated debt for the ECB to purchase in order to make its QE program viable; thereby boosting the possibility that the ECB will have to enact more easing down the road, as its current program eventually falls short of its goals. The icing on the cake was when President Draghi admitted that the ECB\u2019s QE program could extend past September 2016, seemingly in conflict with the earlier assessment that the ECB would achieve its mandate of price stability by 2017.\u201d Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services reckons Mario Draghi was particularly assertive today: This was Draghi at his chest thumping best, boasting of the ECB\u2019s success in bringing down long-term interest rates, and corporate lending rates (emphasizing convergence across the Eurozone, though omitting the fact that this does not apply to Greece and Cyprus), even before the actual QE programme has started. The UK\u2019s Sun newspaper might headline a story on this press conference with the headline \u201cIt was the ECB wot done it\u201d Analysts at Teneo Intelligence have produced a handy wordmap. It shows the differences between Mario Draghi\u2019s statement today and the one at the previous meeting in January: They add: Regarding the program\u2019s duration, Draghi made no effort to clarify the tension between the two possible endpoints he had suggested in January: either September 2016 as a fixed date or once a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation is underway. The still frequent use of \u201ccredit\u201d, \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201cunemployment\u201d in his opening remarks today might suggest Draghi\u2019s sense of urgency has not ebbed away since January. If sustained, this could eventually translate into a more flexible handling of the duration of the purchasing program. After hitting a 12-year low during Draghi\u2019s press conference, the euro is hovering around $1.104 to the US dollar. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, predicts it will keep falling: \u201cPutting it mildly, there isn\u2019t a lot of confidence in the euro system at the moment. Breaking through 1.10 will likely mean a new range is soon carved out in EUR/USD. Given the market\u2019s current reaction to Draghi\u2019s comments, it might not be long before we see parity with dollar.\u201d European stock market have rallied, on the prospect of eurozone QE beginning on Monday. The French CAC and German DAX indices are both up around 1.1% in late trading. Got more questions about the PSPP programme? Here\u2019s the place to go: We\u2019ve enjoyed some vintage European Central Bank press conferences over the years, especially since Mario Draghi took charge. Today\u2019s session in Cyprus wasn\u2019t one of them, alas. Maybe the ECB circus just doesn\u2019t travel well. But it wasn\u2019t a waste of time. Here\u2019s the key points 1) Draghi fired the starting gun on QE. After a long wait, the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme (PSPP) will begin on Monday, snaffling up \u20ac60bn of bonds per month in an attempt to stimulate demand and push inflation up. And the programme will run until September 2016, Draghi said, and might last longer if inflation isn\u2019t on a \u2018sustained path\u2019 by then. 2) The ECB is more optimistic about the eurozone economy. The latest staff forecasts show the eurozone growing by 1.5% this year, up from 1.0% three months ago, then by 1.9% in 2016 (up from 1.5%). And although inflation will be zero this year, it is expected to rise to 1.8% by 2017. Some economists are suggesting this is too optimistic, but it chimes with more upbeat data in recent weeks. 3) The ECB is keeping a tough line with Greece. Draghi insisted, twice, that his central bank was providing all the support possible to the Greek economy. And he also confirmed that another \u20ac500m of liquidity assistance had been provided, taking the total to \u20ac68.8bn. But Draghi also appeared to rule out handing Athens a lifeline by allowing Greek banks to buy more of the country\u2019s short-term debt. That would break rules on monetary financing, he argued. 4) Cyprus\u2019s bailout woes may be easing. The country\u2019s central bank chief predicted that the last capital controls, introduced almost two years ago, will be lifted by the end of the month. This is a good summary: The European Central Bank has just released details of its new quantitative easing programme. Here are the key points: 1) It has been christened the Public Sector Purchase Programme, or \u201cPSPP\u201d (which doesn\u2019t flow off the tongue). 2) PSPP will involve the purchase of \u20ac60bn of public and private sector securities each month, in a way designed to \u201cavoid interfering with the market price formation mechanism: 3) It will be able to buy bonds trading at a negative yield (ie, above face value), as long as the yield is still above the deposit facility rate (currently -0.2%). 4) PSPP will buy debt issued by various eurozone agencies and institutions, as well as government debt: 5) If there is not enough of a particular type of debt available, \u201csubstitute purchases are foreseen.\u201d Here\u2019s the full release: Implementation aspects of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) It\u2019s been a funny old press conference: It\u2019s nearly two years since the Cyprus bailout; with hindsight, would the ECB do anything differently? Draghi bats it over to Cyprus central bank president Chrystalla Georghadji. Georghadji says that the decisions taken two years ago were very painful for the country and its people. But there was no other way.... we should have taken measures before the very difficult decision was taken. When might capital controls be lifted? The very few capital controls that are still in place will be lifted...probably before the end of the first quarter of the year, Georghadji replies. How does the ECB see core inflation changing in the months ahead? Draghi explains that the forecasts for headline inflation (see earlier in the blog) are not only based on oil prices; they also reflect household disposable income and the progress in closing the \u2018output gap\u2019 Draghi is reiterating that the ECB has lent \u20ac100bn to Greece: The last thing you can say is that the ECB is not supporting Greece. Oops... Cyprus\u2019s central bank governor, Chrystalla Georghadji, just mentioned the dreaded T-word. She was explaining that Cypriot bonds could be included in the QE programme once its lenders are happy with its bailout progress (currently they\u2019re not happy, because MPs haven\u2019t passed a law to speed up foreclosures) The euro has hit new 11-year lows since the press conference began Don\u2019t blame us.... Draghi appears to be criticising the new Greek government: This is an important point -- the ECB could start accepting Greek bonds as collateral again, if Greece meets upcoming debt repayments. Draghi also defends the decision to remove the waiver last month -- given the pronouncements of the Greek government, we had no choice, he says. Draghi then warns that inappropriate \u2018communication\u2019 has hurt the Greek banking sector for driving up bond yields and lowering the solvency of Greek banks. The next question is about the \u20ac68bn of emergency funding being provided to Greek banks. Draghi replies that the Greek banking system is solvent, and \u201ca lot has been done\u201d to strengthen it. Maintaining that solvency is a key factor allowing the ECB to keep providing that emergency liquidity. High drama in the press conference, as the last questioner (speaking Greek, I think) tries to respond to Draghi\u2019s last answer. He\u2019s speaking animatedly, and waving his hands, as he takes the ECB president to task. But unfortunately the ECB stopped translating him. The ECB has not changed its mind on Greek debt; it is still refusing to accept it as collateral when making loans to commercial banks. The next question is about Greece, and why it isn\u2019t included in the new asset purchase programme (due to translation problems I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t catch it exactly). Draghi is explaining that the ECB cannot buy the bonds of any country if they\u2019re in a reform programme, so Greek and Cypriot debt are both excluded. He\u2019s also defending the ECB\u2019s role in the Greek crisis, saying it has lent \u20ac100bn to Greece, and doubled its lending in the last couple of months. Another question on QE -- could government bond yields fall so far into negative territory that the ECB can\u2019t actually buy them? Draghi replies that people used to warn that eurozone debt levels were very high, now people are worrying that there aren\u2019t enough bonds for us to buy. Similar statements were made when the UK and US started their own programmes, he adds, suggesting he\u2019s not worried. Draghi then states that the ECB could keep buying bonds until the yields fell under the deposit rate (currently -0.2%). (explainer: Yields are a measure of the interest rate on a bond. Many eurozone bonds are now trading at a negative yield, meaning they are changing hands for more than their face value) Is the ECB willing to allow Greece to issue more short-term debt, by raising the current ceiling on T-bill issuances? We are a rule-based institution, Draghi replies, not a political one. And there is a rule that bans monetary financing -- governments printing money to buy their own debt. We are prohibited from doing that. Onto questions... What does the ECB mean when it says QE will run until it sees a \u201csustained\u201d improvement in the inflation path? It means what it says, Draghi replies. We don\u2019t see any reason, now, to change our plan to buy \u20ac60bn of securities each month until September 2016, \u201cor beyond if needed\u201d There is no room for complacency, Draghi adds. Governments must deliver structural reforms quickly and decisively, to underpin confidence and encourage companies to invest. Eurozone governments must keep to their fiscal targets, and fiscal inbalances must be tackled, he concludes. The ECB has cut its inflation forecast for this year, and predicts prices will be flat. It now expects inflation to be 0.0% in 2015, down from 0.7% previously. But it then expects inflation to rise to 1.5% in 2016 (up from 1.3%), and 1.8% in 2017. If they\u2019re right, that means inflation would be back on target: Draghi is giving a confident vibe: The ECB has raised its growth forecasts. It now expects GDP to rise by 1.5% this year, up from 1.0% previously, followed by faster growth in 2016 and 2017: On economic growth... Draghi warns that the recovery will be \u2018dampened\u2019 by the slow pace of reforms, and the ongoing balance sheet adjustments. The recent fall in the oil price should help the eurozone economy, Draghi says, by boosting household spending and cutting firms\u2019 costs. Draghi argues that the announcement of QE has already helped the eurozone economy. The programme should improve economic growth outlook and reduce economic slack, he adds. Technical details of the QE programme will be released later today. Draghi confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting And he then announces that the ECB will begin buying eurozone government bonds on 9th March, under its new QE programme. The programme will be \u20ac60bn per month (as announced at the previous meeting in January) And it is expected to run until September 2016, or until the ECB sees that inflation is on a \u201csustained path\u201d to its target of close to, but below, 2% in the medium term. Mario Draghi has arrived, and is welcoming reporters to today\u2019s press conference in Cyprus The ECB\u2019s press conference starts in 10 minutes. It is being streamed live, here. The ECB chose a nice day to visit Cyprus; it looks rather sunnier than Frankfurt: There are a few key themes to watch out for in today\u2019s press conference with Mario Draghi. 1) QE, the details. Investors are looking for details of the ECB\u2019s new asset purchase scheme, which was announced at the last meeting in late January. How does it intend to buy these government bonds, and how will it tell if the programme is working? 2) The ECB will release its new staff forecasts; they are likely to predict higher growth, and lower inflation. So, does Mario Draghi think the eurozone economy is recovering -- and if so, how long might QE be needed? 3) The Greek bailout. The ECB is a member of The Troika , forgive me, one of The Institutions, so Draghi can expect questions on Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension Will a third programme be needed? He should also be grilled about the ECB\u2019s decision to stop accepting Greek government bonds as collateral. Might that be reversed?.. ...and how long will the ECB maintain emergency liquidity funding for Greece\u2019s banks? Here\u2019s a snap from today\u2019s ECB meeting in Cyprus: So, the ECB\u2019s main refinancing rate remains at 0.05%, the lowest level level. The deposit facility rate remains at -0.2%, so commercial banks will be charged for leaving deposits at the ECB. And the marginal lending rate (paid by banks when they borrow from the ECB) remains at 0.3%. Here comes the European Central Bank decision.... and it\u2019s also left its benchmark interest rates unchanged. Now we wait 45 minutes for the press conference (or slightly longer if the lifts are broken, like last time) One central bank decision down, one to go.... Britain\u2019s small firms are delighted that interest rates remain so low. John Allan, Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), says \u201cThe Monetary Policy Committee has made the right decision in maintaining the current interest rate, with inflation at a record low of 0.3% and the risk of long term deflation still present in Europe. \u201cMany of our members plan to grow their businesses in 2015, and low interest rates are giving them confidence to invest in their firms by hiring new staff and increasing wages.\u201d Jeremy Cook of World First also reckons that UK interest rates could be unchanged until 2016*: \u201cWe are coming to the end of this ultra-low interest rate experiment in the UK, although I believe there is the possibility that a year from today, rates will remain at 0.5%. Unemployment is falling healthily, the declines in inflation are temporary and soon to come to an end and growth is becoming increasingly resilient. * - not for another 91 years, as I mistyped earlier (thanks Charles!) Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, reckons UK interest rates might not rise until early 2106 2016, because inflation is so far below target. He adds: While the risks of an earlier rate rise have probably increased lately, we still think it most likely that the Bank will wait until February 2016, by which time inflation will be back above 1% and heading towards the 2% target. The MPC may have chalked up six years without raising Bank Rate, but we think it will narrowly avoid making it seven.\u201d Economists have consistently failed to predict that UK interest rates would stay this low for so long, analysts at RBS point out. Britain has just entered its seventh year of record low borrowing costs. The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%, where they have been pegged since March 2009. It also made no change to its \u00a3375bn asset-purchase scheme (quantitative easing). And there\u2019s no accompanying statement from the BoE either. That\u2019s entirely as expected; economists predict that rates will remain unchanged for several months to come. I\u2019ll pull together some (pre-written?) reaction now... Just 10 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its decision on interest rates. Oh the suspense, until analysts at ING ruined it.... At least it wasn\u2019t the finale of House of Cards.. 2014 was a good year for Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG. Walsh picked up \u00a36.4m last year, an increase of almost 30% on 2013. That\u2019s *despite* turning down a 2% increase in his basic salary. Leading by example, apparently.... Europe\u2019s stock markets are inching higher ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s decision on monetary policy, and subsequent press conference. Investors are expecting to hear details of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme, as David Madden of IG explains: Central banks have been the driving force behind the booming stock markets over the past few years and now it is the ECB\u2019s turn to flood the financial system with money. Eurozone equity markets are highly dependent on the stimulus package from the ECB and traders will be looking for Mario Draghi to give the green light signalling the next round of buying. Hopes that Greece\u2019s labour market was recovering have been dented by new data, showing that the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate rose in December to 26.0%, from 25.9%. Elstat reported that the number of employed people dropped by 24,453 during the month, while the number classed as inactive rose by 20,425. The youth unemployment rate (covering 15-24 year olds) was roughly double the headline rate, at 51.2%. Over in Athens the Greek finance ministry has issued a tersely-worded statement denying that the government\u2019s reforms \u2013 being fine-tuned ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting of euro area finance ministers \u2013 was \u201cdiscussed\u201d at a preliminary Euro Working Group session on Wednesday. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: \u201cThe finance ministry categorically denies reports that the contents of the Greek proposals were discussed during yesterday\u2019s Euro working group,\u201d it said. The statement also rejected reports that teams representing the \u201cinstitutions\u201d - the EU, ECB and IMF keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat and until recently known as the Troika - had also arrived in Athens. \u201cThey are beyond reality,\u201d it said. The statement would seem to indicate the growing nervousness in Athens over the reforms as fears mount of a credit crunch ahead of maturing debt obligations the country now faces. The proposals, if viewed as persuasive, could unlock \u20ac7.2bn in aid that Greece has yet to draw down from its initial \u20ac240bn bailout program. Much depends on them! Greek financial website CapitalGR is reporting that Greece\u2019s banks have been given another \u20ac500m of emergency liquidity by the ECB. Britain\u2019s auto industry has posted its longest ever streak of sales growth. New UK car registrations were 12% higher year-on-year in February, suggesting consumer spending remains robust. Foreign exchange traders have pushed the euro down to its lowest levels since September 2003, ahead of the ECB\u2019s press conference later today. The euro hit $1.1028 in early trading, on anticipation that Mario Draghi will announce details of the eurozone\u2019s new quantitative easing programme. Eurozone sovereign bond yields are also hovering around record lows, pushed down by the prospect that the ECB will start buying government debt. Cyprus\u2019s president Nikos Anastasiades will be very happy that ECB president Mario Draghi showered praise on his government last night (flags up our correspondent Helena Smith) In a speech at the presidential palace, Draghi said Cyprus had made \u201cremarkable\u201d progress [a nudge to Greece to crack on with its own reforms?] Dragh said: \u201cIt is safe to say that he programme has been yielding very concrete results, in fact even better results that were forecasted two years ago.\u201d The restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking sector has led to a significant improvement in the health of the financial system.... Indeed it is remarkable that Cyprus is on track to exit the excessive deficit procedure two years ahead of the 2016 deadline. All these achievements are impressive and command respect from the rest of Europe.\u201d Fresh data from the Halifax building society suggests Britain\u2019s housing market is cooling. Prices fell by 0.3% month-on-month in February, Halifax says. That means prices are up by 8.3% over the last year, down from 8.5% in January. This kind of monthly data should be treated with caution. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons activity will \u2018pick up modestly\u2019 in the months ahead: Consequently, we expect house prices to rise around 5% in 2015. Predictions that Germany\u2019s economy is strengthening have taken a knock this morning. German industrial orders shrank by 3.9% in January, compared with December; much worse than the 1.0% decline expected by economists. Although it\u2019s a volatile measure, it may puncture some of the optimism around Germany\u2019s recovery (following blowout retail sales figures on Tuesday). Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, says (via Reuters): It\u2019s a reminder that Germany\u2019s growth at the moment is driven by consumption and not by the manufacturing backbone of the economy.... Something for the ECB\u2019s governing council to consider at today\u2019s meeting. Cyprus\u2019s finance minister has defended the country\u2019s austerity programme, in an interview with Bloomberg TV: However, Cyprus is one of only three European economies that shrank last year (along with France and Finland), as it struggles to recover from its chaotic bailout deal in 2013. Today\u2019s European Central Bank meeting in Nicosia comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of Cyprus\u2019s bailout deal this month. And thousands of Cypriots gathered outside the meeting last night to demand an end to Cyprus\u2019s austerity programme. They chanted slogans such as \u201cNo more austerity and cuts\u201d and \u201cNo to troika and its policies, and called for new pro-growth policies to drag Cyprus out of its recession. Associated Press has more details: Some 18 groups organized the event, including left-wing trade unions, teacher and family groups, as well as student organizations. Some protesters carried banners reading, \u201cEnd to austerity, we want jobs,\u201d and \u201cSave the people, not profits and banks.\u201d Organizers put their demand for growth-oriented policies in a petition addressed to ECB chief Mario Draghi. They say among those attending were French, Greek and Austrian trade unionists as well as European Parliament member Fabio De Masi. Here are more photos from Wednesday night\u2019s protests: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Central Bank Thursday, with the European Central Bank and Bank of England both holding their monthly policy meetings. The ECB, gathered in Cyprus this month, is the main event. President Mario Draghi is expected to flesh out the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing plan at the monthly press conference, from 1.30pm GMT. Draghi will also face questioning over Greece\u2019s bailout, given the ECB is keeping its banks afloat with emergency liquidity aid. We should also get new growth and inflation forecasts from the ECB. The Bank of England, meanwhile, is widely expected to leave interest rates on hold again at noon today. That would mean more than six years of record low borrowing costs. To be honest, we\u2019re more interested in the shock news that Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office is probing the BoE. As my colleague Heather Stewart reported last night: The Bank of England is facing an unprecedented criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over emergency lending measures it took at the height of the credit crisis to inject cash into financial markets. In late 2007 and early 2008, as the authorities struggled to prevent financial markets from freezing up, banks were invited to bid to borrow funds from the Bank of England, in exchange for collateral, in a series of so-called \u201cauctions\u201d. It is the conduct of these liquidity auctions which is now being investigated by the SFO, which said in a statement it is, \u201cinvestigating material referred to it by the Bank of England concerning liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008\u201d. More here: SFO launches investigation into Bank of England liquidity auctions. And we\u2019ll also be monitoring events in Greece. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has denied that Athens will need a third bailout (as his Spanish counterpart claimed yesterday) \u201cThere are no preparations for a third credit package and the country does not need it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Listening to Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank\u2019s canny Italian president, at Thursday\u2019s press conference in Cyprus, you could be excused for thinking he\u2019s already fixed the eurozone. Growth forecasts up; deflation scare over; interest rates falling, helping to unblock lending to the real economy. All he needs now, he suggested, is for eurozone governments to carry out their part of the bargain, and press ahead with the \u201cstructural reforms\u201d so beloved of the ECB (and Brussels). There are two reasons for the ECB\u2019s optimism: firstly, for the moment, Mario Draghi is basking in what Mervyn King once called the Maradona theory of central banking. Even before the ECB has pressed the button and started buying up government bonds, which it will start to do on Monday, markets have already moved in just the way central bankers hope for when they decide to take the drastic measure of launching quantitative easing. The euro has fallen sharply on foreign exchanges; bond yields have declined; and as Draghi was keen to point out, interest rates have started to shift downwards even in what policymakers call the \u201creal economy\u201d \u2014 ie. the one beyond the financial markets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a decline, if not a steep fall, in the lending rates across the euro area,\u201d as he put it. Draghi had carefully and deliberately built up expectations over more than six months of what the ECB would be forced to do if economic and financial conditions failed to improve; and markets have positioned themselves accordingly \u2014 like the defenders dodging out of Maradona\u2019s way in Mexico in the 1986 World Cup, allowing the Argentine player to run straight up the pitch towards the goal. King\u2019s now rather dated sporting metaphor was meant to illustrate the fact that central bankers could sometimes achieve everything they wanted without shifting monetary policy at all. Despite Draghi\u2019s new-found bullishness about the economic outlook, though, he well knows that markets would punish him if he didn\u2019t press ahead with the planned programme of QE: so the ECB and member-country governments will start buying \u20ac60bn a month of bonds on Monday, and keep going until they\u2019re convinced the risk of deflation is a distant memory. Secondly, recent data have pointed to the fact that some of the benefits of much lower oil prices are starting to make themselves felt. Retail sales across the eurozone were surprisingly strong in January, expanding by 1.1% on the month, suggesting consumers are feeling the benefits of lower petrol and utility prices - which in economic terms, act very much like a tax cut, putting more cash in people\u2019s pockets. In the business sector, while the UK is fretting about the impact of the halving of oil prices on the North Sea fields, many eurozone economies are experiencing it mainly as a welcome cut in energy costs \u2014 which is coming at the same time as a depreciation in the currency, making exports more competitive. Some firms may also have delayed decision-making while they waited to see whether Greece would plunge out of the eurozone, reigniting the financial crisis, after the radical left-wing Syriza government swept to power in Athens. There are at least two risks to Draghi\u2019s rosy view. The most obvious, underlined by the flurry of questions about Greece at Thursday\u2019s press conference, is that the Greek crisis is not yet over, and could erupt back into life, causing financial market chaos - if eurozone members are less than happy with Syriza\u2019s promised reforms, for example. The second risk is more subtle. Past evidence suggests the major benefit of QE often comes at its early stages, when the so-called \u201cannouncement effect\u201d is strongest. The powerful message QE sends, that the central bank is determined to get to grips with an economic crisis, can boost confidence and unlock spending \u2014 but that tends to wane after a while. And confidence will be crucial to determining whether there are so-called \u201csecond-round effects\u201d from falling oil prices. If price declines are perceived as widespread and long-lasting, rather than a temporary fillip, consumers may delay spending, companies may start to cut prices, and adjust wages downwards accordingly \u2014 and deflation can become entrenched. Draghi believes the ECB\u2019s determined approach has been critical in avoiding these so-called \u201csecond round effects\u201d.

There doesn\u2019t seem to have been any strategic magic behind Betfair\u2019s improvement. Chief executive Breon Corcoran, who in 2013 was newly arrived from Paddy Power, has cut costs, concentrated overseas adventures on markets where regulators are friendly and introduced a fixed-odds sportsbook alongside Betfair\u2019s pioneering betting exchange.

Do it right and the customers come and the cash flows. Betfair\u2019s triumph is best illustrated by its market value against Ladbrokes, which a generation ago was regarded as having the strongest brand in the betting game.

Thank goodness for that, most long-standing Aviva shareholders will say. They can remember when the dividend was 33p a share \u2013 it was as recently as 2008. One crisis later, under the hapless Andrew Moss, it was 26p. Wilson, on arrival two years ago, took the payment down to 15p as the true depth of Aviva\u2019s capital position and corporate dysfunctionality, became apparent. Now the dividend is back to 18p after Wilson lifted the final by 30%. That\u2019s the right direction at last, and 30% is a fair reflection of the speed at which he has encouraged Aviva to cut costs, improve cash flow and generate more capital. But he\u2019s right: the restoration job is not even close to completion. Wilson, one assumes, wanted to counter suggestions of complacency because Aviva is taking on a second project by buying Friends Life for \u00a35.7bn. On announcement last November, scepticism was rife. Why get deeper into closed life policies, territory where reforming chancellors can undermine the appeal of annuities overnight? Wilson, though, has convinced the doubters and shareholder approval looks a formality. From a cash point of view, the numbers seem to add up; Friends produces plenty of the stuff and Aviva\u2019s dividend prospects should improve further. And Aviva Investors, until now an also-ran, gets another \u00a3120bn to manage. Doubt remains over management stretch. Even after a good kick, Aviva looks far from being a simple business; and, if Wilson wants to upgrade technology and get customers to buy more products, that\u2019s a multi-year task.

      "bodyText": "Insurance firms Aviva and Friends Life have both reported better-than-expected annual profits before a \u00a35.6bn takeover, which is expected to be approved by shareholders later this month. Aviva, the UK\u2019s largest insurer, is acquiring Friends Life at a critical time, with life insurance firms under pressure from new UK pension rules which have triggered a collapse in sales of annuities. Aviva posted a 6% rise in operating profit to \u00a32.17bn for 2014, a touch higher than expected. Friends Life beat City forecasts by a greater margin with a 38% jump in operating profit to \u00a3556m. Aviva lifted its final dividend by 30%, taking the total to 18.1p a share. Its shares rose more than 6% to 564.17p, while Friends Life\u2019s gained 5.6% to 428.87p, making them the two biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index in morning trading on Thursday. The Friends Life brand will disappear after the takeover, which will bring cost savings of \u00a3225m, in part through 1,500 job losses. Aviva\u2019s chief executive, Mark Wilson, declined to give more details about the cuts, saying the company wants to consult staff first. Aviva employs 16,000 people in the UK, including 5,000 in its York and Sheffield-based life and pensions business. There has been a lot of scepticism about the proposed deal. It would be the biggest in the UK insurance industry since CGU merged with Norwich Union in 2000, which ultimately created Aviva. But investors are expected to vote it through at a meeting on 26 March. Shore Capital analyst Eamonn Flanagan said: \u201cOur view remains one of concern as to why Aviva felt the need to do the deal and the distractions involved in an even bigger turnaround story amidst ever greater regulatory oversight.\u201d Wilson described it as \u201cthe right acquisition at the right time\u201d that would speed up the next phase of Aviva\u2019s turnaround. He has streamlined the management structure and sold under-performing businesses to focus on growth markets such as Poland, Turkey and Asia. Wilson said a lot of people thought Aviva was unfixable two years ago when he replaced Andy Moss as CEO after an investor revolt over executive pay and the company\u2019s poor performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in the last two years,\u201d Wilson said, adding that there was still much to do. He likened it to being \u201cin a large boat with a lot of leaks and you don\u2019t know which leak to put your hand over first. But we\u2019ve certainly stopped those leaks and we\u2019ve found that the boat\u2019s starting to move a whole lot faster.\u201d Wilson said Aviva was ready for next month\u2019s UK pension changes that allow retirees to use their pension pots as they choose, rather than forcing them to buy an annuity. Annuities, which provide a regular monthly sum throughout retirement, have long had a bad reputation. They are seen as bad value for money but Wilson says he believes they could become attractive again once interest rates rise. New annuity sales at Aviva fell 16% as bulk annuity sales (the pension pots sold to companies that provide pension schemes for their employees) failed to outweigh a drop in individual annuity sales. Friends Life reported a 15% drop in annuity sales. The Friends acquisition will boost Aviva\u2019s fund management arm, adding \u00a370bn and taking total funds under management to more than \u00a3300bn. Aviva is working on the turnaround of the business, which was recently fined \u00a317.6m by the City watchdog for \u201csystems and controls\u201d failures and paid \u00a3132m in compensation to eight funds.",

      "bodyText": "UK interest rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% for six years after Bank of England policymakers voted for no change at their March meeting. It was at their March 2009 meeting that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee decided emergency measures were required to address extreme circumstances. At that point, they lowered rates from 1% to 0.5% and in another unprecedented move for the then 315-year old institution, pushed the button on quantitative easing. US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed six months earlier with disastrous consequences. Money markets had frozen, and no one fully understood the scale of the crisis that was hurtling head-on towards the global economy. By March 2009 the UK was in recession. Under the then governor Sir Mervyn King, the Bank initially pumped \u00a375bn of new money into the financial system by buying government bonds in an attempt to limit the worst effects of the crisis. QE was ultimately expanded to become a \u00a3375bn programme, which was also left unchanged by the MPC at its Thursday meeting. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said: \u201cOn the sixth anniversary of the introduction of QE and near-zero interest rates, the MPC left policy unchanged at this month\u2019s meeting. \u201cWhile of course it is possible that our medium-term forecasts are blown off course, our central view remains that the committee will begin raising the Bank rate in November this year, about three months earlier than currently factored into the yield curve.\u201d Any other move would have been major shock to the markets, despite the fact that six years on the emergency is over. Britain is out of recession, unemployment is falling, and the economy is growing at an annual rate of close to 3%. But with inflation at a record low of 0.3%, wage growth weak, and some parts of the economy as yet to regain pre-crisis levels, the pressure is off the governor, Mark Carney, to raise rates yet. Carney has, however, made it clear that as the economy begins to get back on its feet \u2013 barring a huge economic shock \u2013 the next move in monetary policy will be a rate rise. The question is when? With inflation expected to remain well below the 2% target in the short term, we could well be talking about the seventh anniversary of historically low rates come March 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG, was paid \u00a36.4m in 2014, an increase of almost 30% on the previous year. The IAG annual report shows that while Walsh\u2019s basic salary was \u00a3850,000, he received an annual bonus of \u00a31.7m, a share award worth \u00a33.6m and pension benefits. Last week, IAG reported after-tax profits of more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3730m) and made a sharp upgrade to its forecast for 2015. Walsh said the results were largely due to the turnaround at BA\u2019s sister airline Iberia, after a restructuring that included thousands of redundancies in Spain as well as reduced terms and conditions for crew. Walsh declined a 2% increase in his basic pay for 2015. Lady Kingsmill, chair of the IAG remuneration committee, said in the annual report: \u201cOnce again, the chief executive of IAG has continued to lead by example in proposing restraint in executive packages.\u201d In the IAG report, Walsh said of Iberia: \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is help themselves.\u201d He added: \u201cThe brand has been rejuvenated and the people are rejuvenated. They\u2019ve done extremely well and to be back in profit is a fantastic achievement.\u201d He said the group was targeting a 10% to 14% operating profit margin in coming years, \u201cdesigned to make sure we can start to pay a dividend to shareholders and sustain that payment\u201d. Walsh still took home less than Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, whose share awards in the last year took her overall pay package to \u00a37.7m. Chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O\u2019Leary, has an annual salary and bonus of \u20ac1.75m - but owns shares in the airline worth around \u20ac500m. IAG was formed in 2011 by Walsh in a merger of two flag carriers, BA and Iberia, which he promised would eventually pay dividends despite heavy losses at the Spanish airline. Iberia turned a profit in 2014 for the first time, after losses that had run at almost \u20ac1m a day during the turbulent, strike-hit early days of the tie-up, when the group was heavily dependent on lucrative transatlantic routes to stay in profit. The group has since acquired the low-cost Spanish carrier Vueling, with Walsh pursuing a strategy of consolidation in the European airline industry. He said \u201csynergies\u201d had saved the group \u20ac633m in 2014, and would be exploring new ways to get value, including common procurement of aircraft in conjunction with controversial Gulf carrier Qatar Airways. He said: \u201cStarting with the Airbus A320, we are going beyond just selecting common airframes to looking at detailed specifications within the aircraft that offer us the chance to save costs ... We are keen in 2015 to explore such a programme with Qatar Airways, not only a valued oneworld alliance partner but also now a significant shareholder with a near 10% stake.\u201d IAG\u2019s latest target in Walsh\u2019s consolidation strategy is Irish carrier Aer Lingus, which revealed monthly traffic figures showing a 22% growth in long-haul passengers year-on-year. The Irish government, which owns 25% of the airline, said it expects IAG to come back with an improved offer on its \u20ac1.36bn bid, despite Walsh\u2019s assertion that he would not hesitate to walk away if its terms were not acceptable. IAG\u2019s share price has risen by around 25% in the last year and more than doubled since March 2013.",

During the 2013 election campaign then opposition leader Tony Abbott pledged $16m of commonwealth money to the multinational confectionery giant to upgrade its Claremont factory in Hobart and restart tours of the facility. Abbott said at the time that the stimulus would create jobs. \u201cI accept that it\u2019s quite unusual for a national government to make direct grants to a commercial operation but Tasmania, I put it to you, is a special case,\u201d he said.

In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.medreach.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CRP-determination-2012-08-010-and-2012-10-024-Nurofen.pdf\">the regulator requested</a> Reckitt Benckiser withdraw any representations that the products targeted the source or cause of pain.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe company declined to do anything,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe TGA issues orders which are ignored, and this is a classic case of the craziness of the complaint system for advertising of pharmaceutical products in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that the ACCC is now taking this on, but before cases like this get to the ACCC they take years to go through ineffective complaints processes and ineffective sanctions. In the meantime, the drug companies are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d</p> <p>Harvey said the TGA had a strong advertising code of conduct, but they had no power to enforce penalties when that code was breached.<br></p> <p>The federal government must strengthen the TGA to give it similar powers to the US Food and Drug Administration, which can enforce fines and force companies to change product packaging, he said.<br></p> <p>A spokesman for the assistant health minster, Fiona Nash, told Guardian Australia: \u201cMinister Nash is always concerned at allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct and is watching the ACCC vs Nurofen case with interest.\u201d</p> <p>He did not respond to questions about whether the minister believed the <br>TGA should be given more powers to hold drug companies to account for <br>misleading claims.</p> <p>Professor Chris Del Mar, an evidence-based medicine specialist from Bond University, agreed with Harvey that the TGA needed to be emboldened.</p> <p>\u201cOur regulatory machinery has failed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe TGA needs to be beefed up and given more teeth to address this, it\u2019s particularly weak on this and also advertising around complementary medicines.\u201d</p> <p>Consumers also needed to be educated about medicines and should not blindly trust the claims made on packaging, he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t expect people to be mini doctors, but they should have enough knowledge to know they need to ask some questions.<br></p> <p>\u201cI would recommend they ask three simple questions; \u2018what would happen if I don\u2019t do anything?\u2019; \u2018what are the other options for treatment?\u2019; and \u2018what are the benefits and harms of each option?\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>A TGA spokeswoman said an independent review of medicines and medical devices regulation was currently underway. That review would examine the TGA\u2019s regulatory framework and processes, including advertising powers, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe review is expected to identify areas of unnecessary, duplicative or ineffective regulation that could be removed or streamlined without undermining the safety or quality of therapeutic goods available in Australia,\u201d she said.</p> <p>It would also ensure Australia \u201ccontinued to be well positioned to respond effectively to global trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Patients risked receiving ineffective and potentially harmful medicines by being misled into believing they were taking a drug tailored to their condition, the chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum, Adam Stankevicius, said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe potential for consumers not to be getting a product that meets their needs is heightened and we need a strong regulatory response to address this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of marketing for specific pain has been around for a while.\u201d</p> <p>The matter is listed for 31 March in the federal court in Sydney.</p>",

Announcing the legal action, ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said: \u201cThe retail price of the Nurofen specific pain products is significantly above that of other comparable analgesic products that also act as general pain relievers.\u201d All four Nurofen products were listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods as being suitable for treating a wide variety of pain types, he said. \u201cRecent price sampling conducted by the ACCC revealed that these products are being sold at retail prices around double that of Nurofen\u2019s standard ibuprofen products and standard products of its competitors.\u201d In a statement, Reckitt Benckiser said it disputed any allegations that it had breached consumer law in relation to Nurofen\u2019s pain-specific packaging. \u201cAll Nurofen packs are approved by the TGA and comply with TGA\u2019s regulatory guidelines,\u201d the statement said. On why they marketed the same product differently, the company said: \u201cNurofen pain-specific products provide easier navigation of pain-relief options for a particular type of pain\u201d. Dr Ken Harvey, a drug policy expert, said drug companies ignored rulings made by the Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA] and its independent complaints resolution tribunal. Harvey complained about the products to the TGA in 2012. In 2013, the regulator requested Reckitt Benckiser withdraw any representations that the products targeted the source or cause of pain. \u201cThe company declined to do anything,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe TGA issues orders which are ignored, and this is a classic case of the craziness of the complaint system for advertising of pharmaceutical products in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the ACCC is now taking this on, but before cases like this get to the ACCC they take years to go through ineffective complaints processes and ineffective sanctions. In the meantime, the drug companies are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d Harvey said the TGA had a strong advertising code of conduct, but they had no power to enforce penalties when that code was breached. The federal government must strengthen the TGA to give it similar powers to the US Food and Drug Administration, which can enforce fines and force companies to change product packaging, he said. A spokesman for the assistant health minster, Fiona Nash, told Guardian Australia: \u201cMinister Nash is always concerned at allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct and is watching the ACCC vs Nurofen case with interest.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether the minister believed the TGA should be given more powers to hold drug companies to account for misleading claims. Professor Chris Del Mar, an evidence-based medicine specialist from Bond University, agreed with Harvey that the TGA needed to be emboldened. \u201cOur regulatory machinery has failed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe TGA needs to be beefed up and given more teeth to address this, it\u2019s particularly weak on this and also advertising around complementary medicines.\u201d Consumers also needed to be educated about medicines and should not blindly trust the claims made on packaging, he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect people to be mini doctors, but they should have enough knowledge to know they need to ask some questions. \u201cI would recommend they ask three simple questions; \u2018what would happen if I don\u2019t do anything?\u2019; \u2018what are the other options for treatment?\u2019; and \u2018what are the benefits and harms of each option?\u2019\u201d A TGA spokeswoman said an independent review of medicines and medical devices regulation was currently underway. That review would examine the TGA\u2019s regulatory framework and processes, including advertising powers, she said. \u201cThe review is expected to identify areas of unnecessary, duplicative or ineffective regulation that could be removed or streamlined without undermining the safety or quality of therapeutic goods available in Australia,\u201d she said. It would also ensure Australia \u201ccontinued to be well positioned to respond effectively to global trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods,\u201d she said. Patients risked receiving ineffective and potentially harmful medicines by being misled into believing they were taking a drug tailored to their condition, the chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum, Adam Stankevicius, said. \u201cThe potential for consumers not to be getting a product that meets their needs is heightened and we need a strong regulatory response to address this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of marketing for specific pain has been around for a while.\u201d The matter is listed for 31 March in the federal court in Sydney.",

      "bodyText": "Etsy, the online craft and vintage goods marketplace, has formally filed its intention to float on New York\u2019s Nasdaq stock exchange. The Brooklyn-based company, founded in 2005 by painter, carpenter and photographer Rob Kalin after he struggled to find anywhere to sell his handmade wooden computers, registered its intention of an initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday night. The company, which has applied to use the ticker ETSY, said it would seek to raise $100m in the IPO but that figure is likely to rise much higher. The initial filing does not include a price range, so it is not possible to work out how much the company might be worth upon IPO. Reports have suggested the company is seeking a $2bn valuation, which would make it the biggest New York technology IPO since 1999. Etsy\u2019s IPO plans have angered many of the website\u2019s seller who worry that floating on the stock market goes against the website\u2019s founding purpose, as a community to help struggling artists sell their work \u2013 not a vehicle to make big profits for investors. \u201cEtsy is betraying its original artists by selling out to make money,\u201d Joy Appenzeller Bauer, an artist who has been selling her work on Etsy since 2009, told the Guardian last month. \u201cFinancially this may make some people very rich, but it is not what Etsy was meant to be about. Artists and crafters are now just window dressing to give the website the appearance that [items] are handmade, but in most cases they are not. They have become the online version of Pottery Barn.\u201d Appenzeller Bauer, from Chicago, claimed Etsy\u2019s future was being driven by the interests of its shareholders, including venture capitalists Accel Partners, Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have anything to do with art or Rob [Kalin]\u2019s vision. This is just a way for them to cash in. If I were an investor I would be worried that the [Etsy] community is very concerned and angry about the IPO plans.\u201d Etsy\u2019s IPO filing reveals that Accel owns 27% of the company, Union Square Ventures owns 15.2% and Index Ventures 12.8%. Kalin, who was twice replaced as Etsy\u2019s CEO following disagreements over the direction of the company, has said trying to maximise shareholder value is \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run a company where you had to use that as an excuse for why it was doing things,\u201d he said in an interview with Inc.com. Before he left the company Kalin, who made his own furniture and underpants, told staff: \u201cWe do not want Etsy itself to be a big tuna fish. Those tuna are the big companies that all us small businesses are teaming up against.\u201d Kalin has not commented on Etsy\u2019s IPO plans. Etsy made a $15.2m loss in 2014 on revenue of $195.6m, a 56% increase compared to 2013, the filing reveals. The company employs 685 employees, 51% of whom are female. Etsy, which makes its money by charging sellers 20 cents per listing and a 3.5% commission on sales, said it had 1.4m active sellers and 19.8m active buyers. The company was last year granted $5m of tax breaks by New York for it to stay in the state despite the company previously stating that it \u201ccould only exist in Brooklyn\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Number of ultra-rich swells to almost 173,000", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s super-rich continued their seemingly unstoppable rise last year with the number of people worth $30m (\u00a319.7m) or more expanding to 172,850. Between them they control nearly $22tn in assets \u2013 more than the national output of the US and Germany combined. Almost 5,300 people joined the ranks of so-called ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), adding $7bn to the wealth of the global elite. Their numbers are forecast to swell by another third over the next decade to 230,000, according to the latest wealth report from upmarket estate agents Knight Frank. The swelling of UHNWIs promises increasing competition among buyers for vineyards, ski chalets and riding stables. Asia\u2019s wealthiest are keen buyers of wine estates, those from Africa and the Middle East favour equestrian properties while Europe and North America\u2019s super-rich stick to second homes in the Alps or the Rockies. Nearly a third plan to splash out more on luxury goods this year than last. Art, luxury watches, fine wine and classic cars remain the most popular \u201cinvestments of passion\u201d. London has been home to more of the ultra-rich than any other city for the past three years (4,364 in 2014), with New York in second place. London should still be in the top spot 10 years from now, Knight Frank said, but Singapore will be snapping at its heels, with 54% growth in its wealth brigade over that period, against a 21% rise in the UK capital. But the country with the fastest growing class of ultra-rich is forecast to be Vietnam, which since the 1980s has been moving from a planned to a market economy and where agriculture still accounts for 19% of national output. Mineral rich Kazakhstan, which has struggled with a reputation for corruption, is another country to watch with the numbers predicted to rise 114% \u2013 that far outstrips the 46% rise expected in neighbouring Russia, partly because many wealthy Russians are based overseas. This year\u2019s report showed that among the wealthiest concerns over the state of the world economy have given way to worries about higher taxes, increased government scrutiny and how to hand over family wealth to the next generation. It comes weeks after an international outcry over revelations of how HSBC in Switzerland had helped wealthy clients potentially hide money from tax authorities, allowing practices such as withdrawals of \u201cbricks\u201d of cash with few questions asked. Tax is now cited as the main reason why the ultra-rich would consider moving to a different country, with the mood around taxes becoming \u201cfebrile\u201d over the past few years, said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank. Property taxes are an issue, in London and other places such as Hong Kong. While the threat of New York mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s \u201cpied-a\u0300-terre\u201d tax does not appear to have dampened house price growth there, recent hikes in stamp duty have hit properties worth more than \u00a32m in London, keeping overall prime house price growth at 5.1% for the year, the report says. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said: \u201cHigh-end property in London and the UK was pretty benignly taxed five years ago.\u201d But this is changing. The latest changes to stamp duty mean higher costs for those buying a property priced at \u00a3937,500 or above. In addition, the capital gains tax exemption for non-residents will be scrapped next month, with the introduction of higher annual charges for residential property held in corporate structures, traditionally favoured by wealthy overseas buyers. Against these tax concerns, London wins in terms of lifestyle and education, Bailey said. A rising number of children from wealthy Russian, Middle Eastern and European families are moving to preparatory schools in London from the age of seven or eight, rather than 13 as a decade ago. This means private and international schools in central London are looking to expand but are finding it hard to find sites, amid competition from free schools. The report comes after the publication of the Forbes magazine\u2019s annual rich list earlier this week, which showed Silicon Valley alone created 23 new billionaires last year. The charity Oxfam said the rate at which a \u201cvery few at the top are coining it in\u201d was a moral outrage when more than a billion people were going to bed hungry every night. Ouliana Vlasova, of research firm WealthInsight, said: \u201cThe growth in wealth could perhaps have been bigger had the world economy picked up more strongly in the second half of last year.\u201d Superyachts and private jets The use of private jets is growing steadily around the world, driven by Asian jetsetters. At the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show, ship-builders, brokers and outfitters all said that the market was improving \u2013 35% more superyachts were sold in the first half of the year than a year earlier, according to Camper &amp; Nicholsons International. This is despite political uncertainty in Russia and the Middle East, traditionally seen as the biggest markets for superyachts. Luxury brands, fine wines and spirits The secondhand market for luxury bags, accessories, watches and jewellery is worth some $19bn, according to Bain &amp; Altagamma. Leather goods and clothing account for $4bn of that, and the market is growing faster than the luxury industry overall, says Bloomberg. Some products fetch higher prices than retail, as customers bypass waiting lists for highly-coveted items such as new Herme\u0300s bags. Meanwhile, French wine and spirits exports such as Cognac have been hit by the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on gifting. But Scottish whisky sales are seeing an uptick in other Asian countries as scotch is associated with status. Classic cars The Historic Automobile Group International\u2019s top index climbed 16% in 2014, albeit down from the 47% surge the year before. HAGI founder Dietrich Hatlapa said the market is returning to normal \u2013 although a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta set a new world record of $38m at Bonhams in August. Overall, classic Porsche models performed best, while more modern supercars from the 1970s and 80s, like the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40, are growing in popularity. Jewellery and art Women\u2019s watches are booming as women\u2019s purchasing power grows, pearls are no longer seen as old-fashioned and coloured diamonds are also en vogue among the ultra-rich. Fancy pink, yellow and blue diamonds have increased in value by 167% since 2005. Christie\u2019s jewellery consultant Raymond Sancroft-Baker said: \u201cThere is a lot of demand from the Gulf States, who are buying back their heritage. I recently valued a pair of natural pearl earrings at a million pounds.\u201d After languishing for a few years, art has fully recovered from the economic crisis and bounced back with annual growth of 15% in 2014, according to Art Market Research. Alberto Giacometti\u2019s bronze Chariot sculpture was the most expensive artwork sold at auction last year, fetching almost $101m at Sotheby\u2019s record-breaking November sale of modern and impressionist art in New York. Rare stamps and coins Stamps have become less popular, except in Africa and Asia. The benchmark philatelic index \u2013 the Stanley Gibbons GB250 \u2013 rose just 3% in 2014, but the market for Chinese and Commonwealth stamps continues to grow strongly, says Keith Heddle, head of investments at Stanley Gibbons. Coins, on the other hand, achieved double-digit growth in 2014 with gains of 13%. A rare Edward VIII, 1937, gold sovereign made \u00a3516,000 when it was auctioned by Baldwin\u2019s in May.",

While the threat of New York mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s \u201cpied-a\u0300-terre\u201d tax does not appear to have dampened house price growth there, recent hikes in stamp duty have hit properties worth more than \u00a32m in London, keeping overall prime house price growth at 5.1% for the year, the report says.</p> <p>Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said: \u201cHigh-end property in London and the UK was pretty benignly taxed five years ago.\u201d But this is changing. <br></p> <p>The latest changes to stamp duty mean higher costs for those buying a property priced at \u00a3937,500 or above. In addition, the capital gains tax exemption for non-residents will be scrapped next month, with the introduction of higher annual charges for residential property held in corporate structures, traditionally favoured by wealthy overseas buyers. <br></p> <p>Against these tax concerns, London wins in terms of lifestyle and education, Bailey said. A rising number of children from wealthy Russian, Middle Eastern and European families are moving to preparatory schools in London from the age of seven or eight, rather than 13 as a decade ago. This means private and international schools in central London are looking to expand but are finding it hard to find sites, amid competition from free schools. <br></p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4a133aac9efbcbf902b74fe852bd1506af52499\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/4/1425470616461/83eb9b0c-c2b9-46bd-ab0c-0e2712512ba3-305x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The square metres of luxury property $1m will buy\" width=\"305\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knight Frank wealth report</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Knight Frank</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> </p> <p>The report comes after the publication of the Forbes magazine\u2019s annual rich list earlier this week, which showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/02/forbes-billionaire-list-2015-world-richest\">Silicon Valley alone created 23 new billionaires last year</a>. <br></p> <p>The charity Oxfam said the rate at which a \u201cvery few at the top are coining it in\u201d was a moral outrage when more than a billion people were going to bed hungry every night.<br></p> <p>Ouliana Vlasova, of research firm WealthInsight, said: \u201cThe growth in wealth could perhaps have been bigger had the world economy picked up more strongly in the second half of last year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"429bc3ba5b7157c0054bc03d65263fa0dc8b4a5d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/4/1425471912933/b20e2955-3447-402a-bf16-022a33b8aa7a-460x353.jpeg\" alt=\"Some of the record-breaking auction results of 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>01</strong> Edward VIII gold sovereign sold by Baldwin\u2019s for \u00a3516,000 <strong>02</strong> 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta sold by Bonhams for $38m <strong>03</strong> Chariot by Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti sold by Sotheby\u2019s for $101m <strong>04</strong> British Guiana 1856 one-cent black on magenta stamp sold by Sotheby\u2019s for $9.48m <strong>05</strong> 1933 Patek Philippe Supercomplication pocket watch sold by Sotheby\u2019s for 23.2m Swiss francs <strong>06</strong> The Mellon Blue diamond sold by Sotheby\u2019s for $32.6m</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Knight Frank</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Superyachts and private jets<br></h2> <p>The use of private jets is growing steadily around the world, driven by Asian jetsetters. At the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show, ship-builders, brokers and outfitters all said that the market was improving \u2013 35% more superyachts were sold in the first half of the year than a year earlier, according to Camper &amp; Nicholsons International. This is despite political uncertainty in Russia and the Middle East, traditionally seen as the biggest markets for superyachts.</p> <h2>Luxury brands, fine wines and spirits</h2> <p>The secondhand market for luxury bags, accessories, watches and jewellery is worth some $19bn, according to Bain &amp; Altagamma. Leather goods and clothing account for $4bn of that, and the market is growing faster than the luxury industry overall, says Bloomberg. Some products fetch higher prices than retail, as customers bypass waiting lists for highly-coveted items such as new Herme\u0300s bags. Meanwhile, French wine and spirits exports such as Cognac have been hit by the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on gifting. But Scottish whisky sales are seeing an uptick in other Asian countries as scotch is associated with status. </p> <h2>Classic cars</h2> <p>The Historic Automobile Group International\u2019s top index climbed 16% in 2014, albeit down from the 47% surge the year before. HAGI founder Dietrich Hatlapa said the market is returning to normal \u2013 although a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta set a new world record of $38m at Bonhams in August. Overall, classic Porsche models performed best, while more modern supercars from the 1970s and 80s, like the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40, are growing in popularity. </p> <h2>Jewellery and art</h2> <p>Women\u2019s watches are booming as women\u2019s purchasing power grows, pearls are no longer seen as old-fashioned and coloured diamonds are also en vogue among the ultra-rich. Fancy pink, yellow and blue diamonds have increased in value by 167% since 2005. Christie\u2019s jewellery consultant Raymond Sancroft-Baker said: \u201cThere is a lot of demand from the Gulf States, who are buying back their heritage. I recently valued a pair of natural pearl earrings at a million pounds.\u201d</p> <p> After languishing for a few years, art has fully recovered from the economic crisis and bounced back with annual growth of 15% in 2014, according to Art Market Research. Alberto Giacometti\u2019s bronze Chariot sculpture was the most expensive artwork sold at auction last year, fetching almost $101m at Sotheby\u2019s record-breaking November sale of modern and impressionist art in New York.</p> <h2>Rare stamps and coins</h2> <p>Stamps have become less popular, except in Africa and Asia. The benchmark philatelic index \u2013 the Stanley Gibbons GB250 \u2013 rose just 3% in 2014, but the market for Chinese and Commonwealth stamps continues to grow strongly, says Keith Heddle, head of investments at Stanley Gibbons. Coins, on the other hand, achieved double-digit growth in 2014 with gains of 13%. A rare Edward VIII, 1937, gold sovereign made \u00a3516,000 when it was auctioned by Baldwin\u2019s in May.</p>",
