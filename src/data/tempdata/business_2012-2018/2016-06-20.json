      "bodyText": "The \u201cnational living wage\u201d and falling cost of food and transport have improved UK household finances, according to a report. Asda\u2019s monthly income tracker shows that the average UK household had \u00a3201 a week of discretionary income in May. This was \u00a313 (7.2%) more than in May 2015 and the highest amount since the supermarket started collecting income data in 2008. The improvement in household budgets follows the introduction in April of the wage, a higher minimum pay threshold of \u00a37.20 an hour for those aged 25 and over. Family finances were also helped by a decline in the cost of some essential items. Food and drink prices fell by 0.4% on the month in May and were down by 2.8% on the year. Transport costs were also lower than a year ago, according to the report compiled for Asda by the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The improvement in spending power will boost hopes that consumers can continue to drive economic growth in the UK. But experts have warned that the economy remains unbalanced, with manufacturing and exports lagging behind the recovery in consumer spending. Asda noted that the EU referendum on Thursday was clouding the outlook for household spending. A spokesperson said: \u201cWhile costs continue to fall for UK households and spending power growth begins to accelerate once more, the long-term picture is more difficult to predict as we wait to see the impact of the EU referendum\u2019s decision on the nation\u2019s pockets.\u201d Surveys published before the referendum have showed only a modest effect on consumer confidence.

      "bodyText": "A senior director at one of the UK\u2019s large banks, when pressed to estimate privately how far sterling would fall against the dollar on Friday if Britons vote for Brexit on Thursday, guessed at 10%. Then he quickly recalculated. No, 10% was too much. He\u2019d never seen a one-day movement in sterling of remotely that size. It would be closer to 5%. That game of guesswork was played at the end of last week. On Monday, one suspects, 10% wouldn\u2019t sound so fanciful. Since last Friday\u2019s low, the pound has risen 4% against the dollar and Monday\u2019s surge was the biggest one-day gain since 2008. This happened on nothing more than a shift in the opinion polls towards remain, even though those same polls still show the outcome as being too close to call. If Brexit is the result, that freshly acquired 4% would be removed in a flash, one assumes. Then one might add the same fall again \u2013 or probably more \u2013 to reflect the fact of a leave victory. Suddenly, sterling at $1.30, versus $1.47 currently, almost becomes a par score after a Brexit vote. The great speculator George Soros, writing in this paper, reckons the drop would be steeper, to below $1.15. That may sound alarmist, but who can say he is wrong? Even Capital Economics, which argues that talk of Brexit triggering recession in the UK is overdone, thinks a vote for leave could push sterling to $1.20. In the circumstances, it\u2019s hard to understand why sterling managed to regain so much ground on Monday and trade at its highest level since January. Anybody with a \u201clong\u201d exposure to the pound that runs beyond the next few days will have three points to consider. First, there is the possibility of substantial losses on Friday. Second, even a close victory for remain - say 52%-48% \u2013 might not be received cheerfully by financial markets; the vote wouldn\u2019t settle the EU question for a generation and the two wings of the Conservative party would be at loggerheads all the way until the general election in 2020. Third, the medium-term trend for sterling is probably lower anyway since the UK needs a weaker currency to repair its current account deficit, which reached a peacetime record of 5% in 2015. Share prices after a Brexit vote are a different matter since the FTSE 100 index is populated with so many companies that earn the bulk of their profits in dollars. But, on the evidence of the past few days, the potential exists for truly enormous moves in currency markets. The bank executive\u2019s prime concern was to ensure that computer algorithms \u2013 set to trigger buy and sell at certain levels \u2013 don\u2019t add to the confusion by executing orders at silly prices, for the bank or for its clients. That sounds a wise precaution: in currency markets, there is the possibility of mayhem. TalkTalk\u2019s bonus question It\u2019s jolly sporting, of course, for TalkTalk chief executive Baroness Harding to donate her \u00a3220,000 bonus (part of a \u00a32.8m pay package) to charity but shareholders may wonder why she was awarded the sum in the first place. Yes, the pay committee used its discretion to cut the bonus from \u00a3343,000 \u201cin the context of the cyber-attack on TalkTalk\u201d, which infuriated customers whose personal data was snatched. And, yes, the award obeyed with the pay principles approved by shareholders. Yet there is a glaring oddity in the profit-related element of the bonus. TalkTalk looks at \u201cheadline\u201d ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) when calculating a quarter of the bonus pot. On that basis, earnings improved from \u00a3245m to \u00a3260m, which the committee regarded as an achievement \u201cbetween minimum and target\u201d. But look at what the \u201cheadline\u201d figure excludes. It ignores the cyber-attack last October that caused \u00a342m to be booked as exceptional charges. Include the exceptionals \u2013 which, bafflingly, also include a cost-cutting programme lasting three years (so not really exceptional, but more like regular business) \u2013 and ebitda fell from \u00a3199m to \u00a3177m. That, one presumes, would have yielded no bonus on the profit-related scoring system. Indeed, at a pre-tax level, TalkTalk\u2019s profits more than halved to \u00a314m last year. Forget the \u201cheadline ebitda\u201d gymnastics. Harding could not have complained if her annual bonus had been zero. Costly decisions at BHS It\u2019s astonishing. A week before he paid \u00a31 for BHS, Dominic Chappell was being told by Olswang, his own advisers, that he might be on the hook for the full deficit in the pension fund; that the hole could be \u00a3500m; that a full actuarial valuation was not available; and that the fund\u2019s trustees might object to a sale, or demand more cash upfront. Chappell went ahead with the purchase anyway. It was an absurd decision. The buyer\u2019s optimism-cum-idiocy does not, of course, remove Sir Philip Green\u2019s responsibilities to pensioners. Green told parliament last week that he always knew he would be part of resolving the pension mess and was not seeking to run away. Good; now let\u2019s see the money. The latest dump of documents, however, raises awkward questions for Olswang. A list of risk factors is one thing. But where is the email to Chappell saying \u201cdon\u2019t do it, you fool\u201d?",

    "webTitle": "George Soros: EU exit risks 'black Friday'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s most famous currency speculator has warned a vote on Thursday for Britain to leave the EU would trigger a bigger and more damaging fall for sterling than the day he forced Britain out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism almost a quarter of a century ago. George Soros, writing in the Guardian, said that a Brexit vote would spark a \u201cblack Friday\u201d for the UK, but the devaluation of sterling would bring none of the benefits to the economy that it enjoyed after it dropped out of the ERM on 16 September 1992 \u2013 Black Wednesday. He said that, as in 1992, there would be big financial gains for speculators who had bet on the UK leaving the EU but that such an outcome would leave \u201cmost voters considerably poorer\u201d. Soros said that unlike after Black Wednesday, there was little scope for a cut in interest rates, the UK was running a much larger current account deficit, and exporters would be unable to exploit the benefits of a cheaper pound due to the uncertainty caused by a vote to leave the EU. \u201cSterling is almost certain to fall steeply and quickly if leave wins the referendum,\u201d Soros said. \u201cI would expect this devaluation to be bigger and also more disruptive than the 15% devaluation that occurred in September 1992, when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors at the expense of the Bank of England and the British government.\u201d In the months following the UK\u2019s departure from the ERM, interest rates were cut from 10% to 5.5% \u2013 easing the financial burdens facing consumers and businesses. However, with official borrowing costs currently at 0.5%, Soros said rates were already at the lowest level consistent with the stability of British banks and meant there was little the Bank of England could do in the event that Brexit led to a recession. A vote to leave would force the pound to slide towards parity with the euro \u2013 \u201ca method of joining the euro that nobody in Britain would want\u201d \u2013 and plunge more than in September 1992 when his $10bn (\u00a36.9bn) bet against the pound broke the Bank of England. \u201cToo many believe that a vote to leave will have no effect on their personal financial positions. This is wishful thinking. If Britain leaves the EU it will have at least one very clear and immediate effect that will touch every household: the value of the pound would decline precipitously. A vote to leave the EU would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets, investment, prices and jobs,\u201d Soros added. \u201cA vote to leave could see the week end with a black Friday and serious consequences for ordinary people,\u201d Soros said. Michael Gove, the justice secretary and leading leave campaigner, said Soros had previously predicted that Britain would be better off with the single currency, a forecast which proved the currency speculator had made mistakes. \u201cGeorge Soros is an advocate of the single currency, an advocate of European integration,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIf economic forecasters were as reliable as doctors or airline pilots then we\u2019d all be billionaires. When we reflect on what George Soros is saying we also need to remember he has got things wrong in the past.\u201d Gove said the EU model was a \u201csinking ship\u201d which Britain could unshackle itself from, and \u201csend Europe in a better, more progressive direction\u201d. Two days before the polls close a series of high-profile figures warned about the risks of a vote to leave. Enda Kenny, the taoiseach of Ireland, appealed to Britain to vote to remain inside the EU, warning that the return of a stronger border between Ireland and Northern Ireland required by a Brexit vote would play into an old narrative \u2013 \u201cone of division, isolation and difference\u201d. Writing in the Guardian, Kenny warned of a psychological effect, saying the reappearance of the old border after decades of work to promote peace and reconciliation \u201cwould be a step backwards and present an opportunity for others, with malign agendas, to exploit\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn repeated his careful endorsement of a remain vote. The Labour leader said he was \u201cnot a lover\u201d of the EU but had come to a rational decision about his support for remain. He cautioned that either result was possible: \u201cI\u2019m hoping there is going to be a remain vote; there may well be a remain vote, there may well be a leave vote.\u201d Amid worries about whether Labour supporters would turn out for remain, Len McCluskey, who heads the Unite trade union, wrote that he was not surprised that they were concerned about immigration. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there has been a gigantic experiment at the expense of ordinary workers. Countries with vast historical differences in wage rates and living standards have been brought together in a common labour market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result has been sustained pressure on living standards, a systematic attempt to hold down wages and to cut the costs of social provision for working people.\u201d Sterling rallied on Monday as polls published over the weekend showed a rise in support for the remain camp after the death of Jo Cox and propelled the pound to its biggest one-day move in almost eight years when compared with the world\u2019s other major currencies. Sterling jumped more than 2% to touch $1.47 against the dollar and headed towards \u20ac1.30 against the euro. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares jumped 3% to 6,204 \u2013 pulled higher by the banking and property companies that had dragged it lower in recent weeks. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, accused remain supporters of trying to take advantage of the death of Cox. \u201cWhat we are seeing here is the prime minister and the remain campaign trying to conflate the actions of one crazed individual with the motives of half of Britain who think we should get back control of our borders and do it sensibly.\u201d Soros said that speculators \u2013 hailed the Gnomes of Zurich in the 1960s by Harold Wilson \u2013 had made large profits at Britain\u2019s expense at the time of the 1967 devaluation. \u201cToday there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful. And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters. A vote for Brexit will make some people very rich \u2013 but most voters considerably poorer,\u201d Soros said. Not all economists agree with Soros\u2019s assertion that a rate cut will not be possible: economists at JP Morgan are among those forecasting a cut to zero in August from the historic low of 0.5%. But economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics expect sterling to plunge if there is a vote for Brexit. \u201cIf Britain opts for Brexit \u2013 as it well could, given the latest neck-and-neck opinion polls \u2013 sterling likely will plunge,\u201d Samuel Tombs at Pantheon said, warning the market was underestimating how far sterling could fall. Tombs warned that capital outflows could be \u201cgargantuan\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A federal judge said two Starbucks customers may pursue a lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of cheating patrons by underfilling lattes. In a decision on Friday, US district judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco said the California plaintiffs may seek damages for fraud and false advertising from Starbucks Corp in their proposed nationwide class action. According to the lawsuit Starbucks is skimping on one of a latte\u2019s main ingredients: milk. \u201cA latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk,\u201d the lawsuit claims, explaining that caff\u00e8 latte is Italian for \u201cmilk coffee\u201d. \u201cTraditionally, a latte is created by mixing steamed milk and espresso, which is then topped with a thin layer of milk foam.\u201d The coffee giant was accused of overcharging customers by systematically serving lattes that are 25% too small, based on a recipe it adopted in 2009 to save money on milk. The two plaintiffs, Siera Strumlauf of San Francisco and Benjamin Robles of Carlsbad, said Starbucks requires baristas to use pitchers for heating milk with etched \u201cfill to\u201d lines that are too low, and to leave a 1/4 inch of free space in drink cups. \u201cBy underfilling its lattes, thereby shortchanging its customers, Starbucks has saved countless millions of dollars in the cost of goods sold and was unjustly enriched by taking payment for more product than it delivers,\u201d the suit reads. The plaintiffs argued that this policy short-changes customers because Starbucks\u2019 cups for tall, grande and venti lattes hold exactly 12, 16 and 20 ounces. Those measurements are advertised on the menu boards in the stores, but when served to customers the lattes do not actually contain that much fluid, they argued. \u201cThis is not a case where the alleged deception is simply implausible as a matter of law,\u201d Henderson wrote. \u201cThe court finds it probable that a significant portion of the latte-consuming public could believe that a \u2018Grande\u2019 contains 16 ounces of fluid.\u201d Henderson did not rule on the case\u2019s merits. He dismissed three of the plaintiffs\u2019 eight claims against Seattle-based Starbucks, as well as their request for injunctive relief. When the lawsuit was first filed, Jeff Rossen, a reporter for the Today Show, purchased Starbucks lattes at six different New York locations to find out how many fluid ounces customers were \u201creally getting\u201d. None of his six lattes contained 16 ounces as advertised \u2013 one contained less than 12 ounces after the foam settled. \u201cIn the food science community, as well as in the weights and measures community, foam is not measured on a volumetric basis,\u201d the plaintiffs argued in their suit. At the time, Starbucks called Rossen\u2019s experiment \u201cunscientific\u201d. A Starbucks spokesman, Reggie Borges, on Monday said the company believes the lawsuit is without merit and is prepared to defend itself against the remaining claims. He also said that if a customer is not satisfied with how a beverage is prepared, \u201cwe will gladly remake it\u201d. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. In May, another lawsuit was brought against Starbucks \u2013 this time by a Chicago woman who claimed that she was served too much ice and too little caffeine in her Starbucks\u2019 cold beverages. According to Starbucks, this lawsuit was also without merit. \u201cOur customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any \u2018iced\u2019 beverage. If a customer is not satisfied with their beverage preparation, we will gladly remake it,\u201d the company said in a statement. Reuters contributed to this report.",

      "bodyText": "The BHS pension trustees were concerned about the sale of the retailer to Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 and believed it was \u201cmaterially detrimental\u201d to the pension scheme, newly published documents have revealed. The documents, released by the parliamentary committee investigating the demise of BHS, raise new questions about why the deal was allowed to go ahead and increase the pressure on Sir Philip Green, Chappell and the latter\u2019s advisers. An analysis of the risks involved ahead of the deal by lawyers Olswang, which advised Chappell\u2019s consortium, said the pension trustees were concerned and were seeking to involve the pensions regulator. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 last spring. The company collapsed this April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Olswang drew up a \u201cpension risk matrix\u201d just days before Chappell bought BHS on 11 March 2015. The firm also said Retail Acquisitions had no direct access to the BHS pension trustees and that it had not been provided with an up-to-date actuarial valuation of the pension scheme while it was conducting due diligence on the retailer. Olswang also said the pensions regulator and the pensions protection fund were potentially seeking an equity stake in BHS in return for agreeing to a restructuring of the pension scheme called Project Thor, which the law firm described as expensive. In a list of risks connected to the pension scheme, Olswang wrote of a lack of information. It said: \u201cWe would ordinarily expect full disclosure of all pension information including historical information, all advice in respect of Project Thor and direct access to the trustees. \u201cWe are instructed that it is not possible in the time available and that the transaction will nevertheless proceed.\u201d Olswang drew up another document on 6 March 2015. Headlined \u201cissues list\u201d, it broke down the different views of the seller and buyer during the negotiations. It stated that the seller, Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia, believed Retail Acquisitions should assume the full risk of the pension deficit and pay for a restructuring of the scheme. It also referred to a \u201cpotential \u00a3500m hole in the pension funds\u201d. This appears to contradict Green\u2019s evidence to MPs last week that he never planned to run away from the deficit. It also demonstrates that Chappell was aware of the pension problems BHS faced. Drafts of the sale agreement between Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions show Green initially pledged to provide a \u201c\u00a350m war chest\u201d for the pension scheme. In a later version, however, this became a commitment to pay \u00a35m a year for three years towards the scheme and a maximum of \u00a315m towards any \u201cunpaid contributions\u201d if it was restructured. A spokesman for Green declined to comment on the evidence. A source close to him, however, said it \u201cblows a hole\u201d in claims that Chappell was not told about BHS\u2019s pension deficit, and that Green was committed to contributing between \u00a340m and \u00a350m to the pension scheme throughout the negotiations. Chappell\u2019s evidence to the committee about the pension was also questioned by the chair of the BHS pension fund trustees, Chris Martin, in a letter sent to the MPs after the serial bankrupt appeared in parliament. Martin said it was \u201cincorrect and entirely untrue\u201d that the trustees had told Chappell ahead of the sale that they would be supportive of a restructuring plan similar to Project Thor and had promised to deal with the regulator. He said the trustees were also clear that the cost of a Thor-style restructuring would be significantly more than the \u00a350m to \u00a370m indicated by Chappell during his evidence. \u201cI do not know where he obtained these figures from,\u201d Martin wrote.",

      "bodyText": "The pound posted its biggest one-day rise for almost eight years and the FTSE 100 share index jumped 3% on Monday, as traders reacted to an apparent shift in support towards a remain vote in Thursday\u2019s EU referendum. A shift in opinion polls suggesting the remain camp had regained ground was enough to send the pound soaring. After coming under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks, it rallied more than 2.3% against a basket of other big currencies, the biggest percentage gain since October 2008. It rose more than 2% against both the US dollar and the euro. The stock markets were in similar mood. The FTSE jumped 3% to 6,204, the biggest one-day rise since mid-February. The optimism was mirrored on other European bourses and Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 200 points, or 1.3%, at the time of the close in London. New opinion polls and a shift in bookmakers\u2019 odds prompted an abrupt change in financial market sentiment, catching some investors off-guard, said Jasper Lawler, an analyst at the spread betting and financial trading site CMC Markets. \u201cGlobal markets have had a Bremain bounce. A new optimistic tone has taken hold at the beginning of the final week before the Brexit referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cRisky assets, notably stocks, oil and the British pound have surged whilst haven positions in gold and the Japanese yen have been liquidated.\u201d The rallies came as Betfair, the online gambling site, said the implied probability of the UK remaining in the EU had risen to about 78%, up from 60 to 67% on Friday. Shares in banks and housebuilders, which are considered some of the most vulnerable to the consequences of Brexit, were the top performers on Monday. Royal Bank of Scotland shares were up 7%, Barclays 6.7% and Lloyds 7.6%. Among the housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey rallied 6.8% and Barratt Developments 6.8%. There were warnings, however, that investors were setting themselves up for heavy losses if the referendum result on Friday does not go the remain camp\u2019s way. There were strong words from a former Bank of England deputy governor that markets were risking an \u201cearthquake\u201d in the event of Brexit. Sir John Gieve said many investors were unprepared for a potential vote to leave the EU. \u201cI think this would be a hell of a shock,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV. \u201cAs you see, the polls are evenly balanced. I still think that a lot of people in our creditors are assuming that it\u2019ll all come right. They\u2019re not ready for an earthquake.\u201d The optimistic tone on UK markets was echoed in Germany, where the Dax share index rose 3.4% and in France where the CAC40 gained 3.5%. Experts were quick to remind investors, however, that shares and other riskier assets were selling off sharply just a few days earlier. Chris Beauchamp, a senior market analyst at the online trading company IG, said: \u201cThe frenzy of buying that has been seen across global markets over the past few hours matches the panic selling we witnessed last week. Investors have rushed back to buy up stocks, currencies and commodities in a similar fashion to the way in which they abandoned them a few days ago. \u201cThat such shifts in global markets can be occasioned by shifts in polling of a few thousand people in just one nation seems odd, but such is the importance of the Brexit referendum to global markets that all other concerns have been cast aside, at least for now.\u201d The sharp move in the pound against the dollar also reflected receding expectations of a near-term interest rate rise from the US central bank, especially following remarks from a key policymaker last week. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to get Brexit tunnel vision. Central banks still matter,\u201d said Lawler. \u201cA very dovish shift from the Federal Reserve\u2019s James Bullard, who on Friday said the Fed may only raise rates once before 2018, has contributed to a drop in the US dollar, adding to sterling strength.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons has been forced to repay cash and discipline staff after it was found to have breached the grocery market code of conduct for a second time by demanding lump sums of about \u00a32m from suppliers. The grocery market watchdog said Morrisons admitted to making 19 requests which were above and beyond agreed deals with suppliers in contravention of an industry code in place since 2009. The contraventions came to light after a number of suppliers contacted Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA) Christine Tacon after the Guardian revealed details of the demands for one-off payments in July last year. The Guardian also revealed a letter from Morrisons\u2019 legal team advising buyers to contact them for advice on how to \u201cconstruct arguments that are credible\u201d in order to continue to demand such payments \u2013 meeting the letter of the code but, it could be argued, not the spirit. The GCA said she had received evidence from suppliers that senior Morrisons personnel were present at a meeting where lump sums of as much as \u00a32m were requested from suppliers. Some requests for cash had been accompanied by \u201cclear indications that suppliers would suffer detriment, perhaps de-listing, if payments were not made\u201d. These had \u201cgone away when it hit the press\u201d, a report listed on the GCA\u2019s website notes. Morrisons could have faced a full investigation and potentially a fine worth up to 1% of turnover, or more than \u00a3100m, but Tacon said there was no need to conduct an investigation because the supermarket had taken \u201cswift action\u201d to rectify the matter. The chief executive, David Potts, ordered an internal investigation in which 66,000 emails were examined and employees interviewed, with disciplinary action taken when appropriate, including the departure of some staff. The GCA said she had been \u201cassured that additional training, more robust internal processes and increased audits are now in place and that Wm Morrison checked to see that no similar activity occurred at its year end in February 2016\u201d. Instead the GCA published details of the matter as a case study to clarify that such retrospective lump sum payments not explicitly agreed in supplier contracts were in breach of the code. Morrisons had also contacted suppliers who had paid money for \u201cno clear benefit\u201d and offered them the money back which \u201cin some cases was accepted\u201d. It is understood that very few suppliers took up the payments. \u201cThe GCA acknowledged that Wm Morrison had responded immediately when alerted to the issue, had conducted extensive internal investigation and this had led to the requests [for payments] not being followed up,\u201d according to the published case study published.

In that instance the adjudicator publicised the case as a \u201ccase study\u201d and Morrisons reimbursed the suppliers involved. In a survey of suppliers published by the GCA a year ago, 30% of Morrisons suppliers thought the supermarket rarely complied with the grocery code and a further 2% thought it never did \u2013 making it the second worst performer of the big four supermarkets behind Tesco. The latest issue with the industry watchdog comes as Morrisons faces a potential liability of up to \u00a320m as My Local, the group that bought the Bradford-based group\u2019s convenience store chain, looks at options for the business, including administration. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk as My Local, which operates 120 stores, has brought in accountancy firm KPMG. My Local, led by the retail veteran and Secret Millionaire star Mike Green, bought 140 Morrisons M Local convenience stores for \u00a325m last September.

      "bodyText": "Lidl has become only the second grocer to sign up to a 12-month-old scheme to back British farmers by promising to buy more of their produce and offer long-term supply deals. The German discounter joins its close rival Aldi, which almost a year ago became the first retailer to sign up to the National Farmers Union-backed \u201cfruit and veg pledge\u201d, which aims to boost the profitability of British farmers and suppliers. The code includes a commitment to paying on time and in full, offering more certainty on price and production requirements and aiming to reduce waste by buying the whole crop and adopting realistic product specifications. The farmers\u2019 union has called on all retailers to sign up publicly to the pledge, which took three years to draw up after the publication of its Catalyst for Change report. The union has previously said it has been involved in negotiations with other major UK retailers including Tesco, but only the relatively small-scale discounters that together account for about 10% of the UK market have signed up. Catalyst for Change found millions of pounds had been stripped out of the fresh produce sector through poor supply chain practices and a short-term approach to relationships with growers and intermediaries, damaging farmers\u2019 ability to produce fruit and vegetables. Although there is a code of conduct covering major grocers\u2019 relationships with their suppliers, many farmers are not covered because they go through wholesalers rather than dealing with supermarkets directly. Ali Capper, NFU horticulture and potatoes board chair, said: \u201cWe are delighted that Lidl has publicly committed to our pledge, highlighting its commitment to long-term supply relationships, equitable distribution of reward along the supply chain, and fair and respectful trading relationships. \u201cOur goal is to generate integrity, honesty and openness across the market and that can only come from the key asks within our pledge \u2013 which include price certainty, transparent working and strong, long-term relationships that are fair for everyone involved.\u201d Ryan McDonnell, commercial director for Lidl UK, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very keen to ensure that our sourcing process supports the growth and development of UK growers, which is vital in encouraging more and more people, particularly our shoppers, to regularly eat more fruit and veg.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on 23 June could cause the pound to plunge and interest rates to rise, according to some economists. Here are some of the issues that savers, homeowners and investors should consider before voting. What would a leave vote mean for interest rates and my mortgage? George Osborne has argued that a vote for a Brexit will mean a rise in interest rates from a record low of 0.5%. However, some market watchers believe interest rates will fall because the Bank of England will be forced to stimulate the economy in the event of a leave vote. Economists at JP Morgan forecast borrowing costs could fall to zero by August if there is a vote to leave. In the run-up to the vote, five- and 10-year fixed-rate mortgages have been at their lowest ever level. This is because government bonds are seeing a drop in yields \u2013 or the interest rate they pay out to investors \u2013 as the City searches for havens for its cash in the event of a leave vote. If bonds become a hot ticket among investors and rise in price, then yields fall. Ray Boulger, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, said the decline in yields has yet to be passed on fully so a remain vote should not necessarily lead to a sharp increase in mortgage rates. Should I buy my travel money now? A vote to leave could cause the pound to plummet. In February, investment bank Goldman Sachs claimed the value of sterling could fall by up to 20%. If such predictions are correct, holidaymakers heading to Spain and other eurozone countries might find the pound has less spending power than it did last summer. Last August \u00a31 bought about \u20ac1.42; on Monday it was about \u20ac1.29, though that\u2019s better than \u20ac1.26 last week. Anyone worried about the pound plunging, can buy currency now or load money on to a prepaid currency card. Will cash machines operate if there is a vote for Brexit? The authorities are keen to avoid a rerun of the queues that formed around Northern Rock in September 2007 if there is a sudden panic among customers. ATMs will be full of cash. The banks will hope they do not suffer any IT outages that could create the impression there is not enough money in the system. Electronic payments are also more popular than they were during the previous crisis so any sudden need for cash should be reduced. Will my savings be safe? Money in bank accounts, savings accounts and cash Isas is protected up to the value of \u00a375,000 by an EU directive. There is no need to withdrawcash from any bank or building society covered by this deposit guarantee, whereas cash stored under the mattress is rarely insured. The Bank of England is likely to enter the market to provide liquidity \u2013 making sure banks have enough cash \u2013 if an exit vote prompts market mayhem and investors attempt to pull cash out of the UK. Indeed, the bank has been offering money to institutions via three pre-announced money market operations, where funds are offered to UK banks. Will my plans to buy or sell a house be in trouble? A range of organisations have predicted a Brexit vote would lead to a fall in property prices, and there is anecdotal evidence that many buyers and sellers have put their plans on hold until Friday at least. Zoopla, the property website, has warned that Brexit would reverse the gains in house prices made over the past five years, citing Treasury research. For investors looking to make money out of property, this will be bad news. But homebuyers should look to the longer term. UK housebuilding is not keeping up with demand, and unless mortgage rates rocket, that could mean upwards pressure on prices resumes once the dust has settled. I own a property abroad. Should I prepare to sell it? Currency movements will be the biggest concern for overseas homeowners whose holiday property is in an EU country. A sharp fall in the pound against the euro will leave overseas home owners better off in sterling terms, should they sell after a Brexit vote. But some experts have suggested British borrowers may find it harder to get a mortgage abroad if the UK leaves the EU and some will worry that, as non-EU nationals, they will be treated differently in tax terms. However, there are bilateral tax agreements in place between the UK and other European countries that are not directly linked to Britain\u2019s EU membership. What should small business owners do? The payments system \u2013 from cash machines to direct debit - will still be operating so shopkeepers will be able to function as usual. Businesses relying on exports or imports should not be impacted immediately until the UK invokes article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which puts a two-year deadline on Britain leaving the EU and arranging a new trade relationship. Should I sell any shares I own? No one, apart from hyper-speculative day traders, recommends this. The FTSE surged on Monday as polls suggested Britain would remain in the union, but could just as easily lurch backwards again. Shares in housebuilders and banks appear to be the most volatile; if you own shares in, say, Lloyds Banking Group, and you are convinced Brexit is on the cards, you may want to sell. But over the longer term that may look silly: big investment groups think equity markets are relatively cheap, with lots of money sitting on the sidelines waiting to be spent once the result has been digested. If it is a Remain vote, there could be a \u201crelief rally\u201d as money is pumped into shares. Should I consider cashing in my pension? Given that pension planning operates on a 20 or 30 year timeline, immediately cashing in a pension pot would be a rash and unnecessary move . Anyone with a public-sector pension scheme, where the payouts are guaranteed, is not affected. For those whose pension pots are invested in the stock market, the chancellor has warned that Brexit could wipe \u00a332,000 off the average pensioner\u2019s wealth. Leave campaigners say such warnings are wrong. Pension expert Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown said there are likely to be gains and losses. Miserably low rates for annuities \u2013 the regular income paid out of a pension pot \u2013 could move up if interest rates were raised to defend sterling. But if the currency is plunging, the underlying value of pension pots will decline.",

Here are some of the issues that savers, homeowners and investors should consider before voting.</p> <h2><strong>What would a leave vote mean for interest rates and my mortgage?</strong> </h2> <p>George Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/george-osborne-says-brexit-will-drive-up-interest-rates\">has argued that a vote for a Brexit will mean a rise in interest rates</a> from a record low of 0.5%. However, some market watchers believe interest rates will fall because the Bank of England will be forced to stimulate the economy in the event of a leave vote. Economists at JP Morgan forecast borrowing costs could fall to zero by August if there is a vote to leave.</p> <p>In the run-up to the vote, five- and 10-year fixed-rate mortgages have been at their lowest ever level. This is because government bonds are seeing a drop in yields \u2013 or the interest rate they pay out to investors \u2013 as the City searches for havens for its cash in the event of a leave vote. If bonds become a hot ticket among investors and rise in price, then yields fall. </p> <p>Ray Boulger, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, said the decline in yields has yet to be passed on fully so a remain vote should not necessarily lead to a sharp increase in mortgage rates.</p> <h2><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Should I buy my travel money now?</strong></h2> <p>A vote to leave could cause the pound to plummet. In February, investment bank Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/brexit--slash-sterling-20-warns-goldman-sachs\">claimed the value of sterling could fall by up to 20%</a>.</p> <p>If such predictions are correct, holidaymakers heading to Spain and other eurozone countries might find the pound has less spending power than it did last summer. Last August \u00a31 bought about \u20ac1.42; on Monday it was about \u20ac1.29, though that\u2019s better than \u20ac1.26 last week.</p> <p>Anyone worried about the pound plunging, can buy currency now or load money on to a prepaid currency card. </p> <h2><strong>Will cash machines operate if there is a vote for Brexit?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3db6a6c90812fa203182ce074f1c98d94a7b2f6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3db6a6c90812fa203182ce074f1c98d94a7b2f6d/0_253_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman uses a Barclays cash machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman uses a Barclays cash machine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The authorities are keen to avoid a rerun of the queues <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/13/northernrock\">that formed around Northern Rock in September 2007</a> if there is a sudden panic among customers. ATMs will be full of cash. The banks will hope they do not suffer any IT outages that could create the impression there is not enough money in the system. Electronic payments are also more popular than they were during the previous crisis so any sudden need for cash should be reduced.</p> <h2><strong>Will my savings be safe?</strong></h2> <p>Money in bank accounts, savings accounts and cash Isas is protected up to the value of \u00a375,000 by an EU directive. There is no need to withdrawcash from any bank or building society covered by this deposit guarantee, whereas cash stored under the mattress is rarely insured. </p> <p>The Bank of England is likely to enter the market to provide liquidity \u2013 making sure banks have enough cash \u2013 if an exit vote prompts market mayhem and investors attempt to pull cash out of the UK. Indeed, the bank has been offering money to institutions via three pre-announced money market operations, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/eu-referendum-fears-bank-of-england-pledges-extra-funding-mark-carney\">where funds are offered to UK banks</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Will my plans to buy or sell a house be in trouble?</strong> </h2> <p>A range of organisations have predicted a Brexit vote would lead to a fall in property prices, and there is anecdotal evidence that many buyers and sellers have put their plans on hold until Friday at least. Zoopla, the property website, has warned that Brexit would reverse the gains in house prices made over the past five years, citing Treasury research. </p> <p>For investors looking to make money out of property, this will be bad news. But homebuyers should look to the longer term. UK housebuilding is not keeping up with demand, and unless mortgage rates rocket, that could mean upwards pressure on prices resumes once the dust has settled.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>I own a property abroad. Should I prepare to sell it</strong>?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33b38bc12ccde30ffddd46bdc4be86b16a2f66d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33b38bc12ccde30ffddd46bdc4be86b16a2f66d3/0_174_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sandcastle with a British flag in the Canary Islands, Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some experts suggest British borrowers may find it harder to get a mortgage abroad if the UK leaves the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currency movements will be the biggest concern for overseas homeowners whose holiday property is in an EU country. A sharp fall in the pound against the euro will leave overseas home owners better off in sterling terms, should they sell after a Brexit vote. But some experts have suggested British borrowers may find it harder to get a mortgage abroad if the UK leaves the EU and some will worry that, as non-EU nationals, they will be treated differently in tax terms. However, there are bilateral tax agreements in place between the UK and other European countries that are not directly linked to Britain\u2019s EU membership.</p> <h2><strong>What should small business owners do?</strong></h2> <p>The payments system \u2013 from cash machines to direct debit - will still be operating so shopkeepers will be able to function as usual. Businesses relying on exports or imports should not be impacted immediately until the UK invokes article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which puts a two-year deadline on Britain leaving the EU and arranging a new trade relationship. </p> <h2><strong>Should I sell any shares I own?</strong></h2> <p>No one, apart from hyper-speculative day traders, recommends this. The FTSE surged on Monday as polls suggested Britain would remain in the union, but could just as easily lurch backwards again. Shares in housebuilders and banks appear to be the most volatile; if you own shares in, say, Lloyds Banking Group, and you are convinced Brexit is on the cards, you may want to sell. But over the longer term that may look silly: big investment groups think equity markets are relatively cheap, with lots of money sitting on the sidelines waiting to be spent once the result has been digested. If it is a Remain vote, there could be a \u201crelief rally\u201d as money is pumped into shares. <br></p> <h2><strong>Should I consider cashing in my pension?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab95650dd98c11235dc8aa7333cdfe6890acc5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab95650dd98c11235dc8aa7333cdfe6890acc5e1/0_40_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pensioners in Sussex.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Those with pension pots invested in the stock market could lose large sums of money in the event of Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that pension planning operates on a 20 or 30 year timeline, immediately cashing in a pension pot would be a rash and unnecessary move . Anyone with a public-sector pension scheme, where the payouts are guaranteed, is not affected. For those whose pension pots are invested in the stock market, the chancellor has warned that Brexit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/brexit-could-cost-pensioners-32000-chancellor-says\">could wipe \u00a332,000 off the average pensioner\u2019s wealth</a>. Leave campaigners say such warnings are wrong.</p> <p>Pension expert Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown said there are likely to be gains and losses. Miserably low rates for annuities \u2013 the regular income paid out of a pension pot \u2013 could move up if interest rates were raised to defend sterling. But if the currency is plunging, the underlying value of pension pots will decline. </p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "But here\u2019s the key question: On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow as we continue the run up to the EU referendum and find out if indeed the market rally can last. Volatility surrounding this week\u2019s vote on whether the UK leaves the European Union has continued, with shares and the pound surging on signs that the Remain camp was regaining lost ground, recovering from their recent slump. The FTSE 100 saw \u00a347.5bn added to the value of the UK\u2019s top companies, with the index up more than 3% - its biggest daily rise since February. The pound recorded its biggest one day gain since the financial crisis of 2008, up more than 2% agains a basket of currencies. Meanwhile oil rose more than 2.4% to $50.35 a barrel, helped by the latest on the referendum and a survey from data firm Genscape pointing to a fall in US crude stocks. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 182.91 points or 3.04% to 6204.00 Germany\u2019s Dax soared 3.43% to 9962.02 France\u2019s Cac closed 3.5% higher at 4340.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.54% to 17,353.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.41% higher at 8647.1 In Greece, the Athens market rose 5.4% to 586.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.09% or 192 points. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Global markets have had a Bremain bounce. A new optimistic tone has taken hold at the beginning of the final week before the Brexit referendum. A phone poll from Survation and an internet poll from YouGov showing a lead for the Remain side has prompted a perception that the Brexit tide has turned. A change in bookmaker\u2019s odds in favour of the UK remaining in the EU has been another contributor to fading fears of a Brexit in financial markets. The FTSE 100 has closed 3% higher at 6204.00 after the latest polls suggested that the chances of the UK voting to leave the European Union had receded somewhat. This is the biggest one day rise since 12 February this year, although the index has come off its best levels of the day, when it saw the largest daily increase since last August. And it has only regained the levels seen on 9 June, before the polls started showing big gains for the Leave campaign. Sterling is now 2.3% higher against the dollar, trading around $1.47, its highest level since January this year. The pound is also up 2% on the day against the euro at 77.07p a euro. Buy oil if the UK votes for Brexit, according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic Bank SEB: Last week we saw a taste of what might happen to markets if the UK votes to exit the EU. Along a broad based sell-off across markets, Brent crude sold 11% off from the recent peak of $52.86 a barrel to a low last week of $46.94. There was a clear exit from long speculative positions and an increase in short positions in WTI crude [the US benchmark]. In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity. The sharp rebound in the oil price during the last two days is a good indication of the solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50 a barrel. While a Brexit would be damaging for the Brent crude price in the short term, we think that its impact on oil demand would only be marginally negative. While overall sentiment in financial markets could be depressed for quite some time, the supply/demand balance for oil would not be impacted very much. If we get a second negative round of sell-off ahead of the vote this week, with Brent crude down towards $45 a barrel, we view it as a good buying opportunity. If a Brexit then actually happens, Brent crude would sell further down, but it would not stay there long. On Wall Street, the market has now indeed settled down, and the optimism continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 252 points or 1.4%, while European markets are holding on to the bulk of their gains. In the general risk-on attitude among investors, oil is also on the rise, with Brent crude up 1.6% at $49.97 a barrel. Carmaker Nissan has said it will take legal action against the official Leave campaign for using its logo in a leaflet calling on voters to back Brexit. Reuters reports: On one \u201cVote Leave\u201d flyer, the firm\u2019s logo appeared next to those of four other major companies including Unilever and fellow carmaker Vauxhall with the message: \u201cMajor employers ... have all said they\u2019ll stay in the UK whatever the result of the referendum.\u201d Nissan, which says it would prefer Britain to remain in the EU, said it would be issuing legal proceedings on Monday in Britain\u2019s High Court to stop \u2018Vote Leave\u2019 from using its name and logo and to \u201cprevent them making any further false statements and misrepresentations concerning Nissan. America\u2019s stock market is joining the global rally, as nerves over Thursday\u2019s EU referendum recede. The Dow Jones index has jumped by 202 points, or 1.1%, as the chimes of the Wall Street bell ring out. It will take a few minutes for trading to settle down, though..... More analysts are predicting today that \u2018don\u2019t-know\u2019 voters will decide to back the status quo in Thursday\u2019s referendum. That\u2019s a key factor behind the flood of money into shares, and the British pound, today. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says that many referendums across the world show that undecided voters don\u2019t \u201cbreak evenly\u201d. The British public is risk-averse and, absent a well-articulated plan for EU exit, is still more likely to opt for the status quo than a leap into the unknown. Historical analysis of six previous referenda in the UK (most prominently on the Alternative Voting system, devolution and Scottish independence) since 1975 show a tendency for a hefty swing towards the status quo in the run-up to polling day \u2013 a trend we are beginning to see from this weekend\u2019s polling. Derek Halpenny, the European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, makes a similar point (via Reuters) The momentum has changed, and perhaps this is the first sign of what a lot of the polling experts had been suggesting,which is that the \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 portion was going to be crucial and historically there tends to be a shift towards the status quo in the final days before a referendum. I think that\u2019s what the market is reacting to.\u201d The stock market rally is hitting new heights, driving the FTSE 100 index up by 200 points today to 6223. Unless the mood changes, we could be looking at the biggest one-day leap in 10 months. City expert Louise Cooper has cautioned against assuming that the EU referendum is now \u201cin the bag\u201d for the Remain campaign. She says: Firstly, it should be no surprise to read that markets get things wrong. Secondly this move is driven by computer trading, with computer algorhythms driving the move higher. As various technical levels are breached, more buy orders come in and momentum gathers. The \u201creal players\u201d in the market - corporates and pension funds - are mostly on the side lines.... The sterling rally does not suggest that the Remain campaign has it in the bag. This is going to be one hell of a week. Louise also confirms that the surge in the pound today is quite remarkable: The pound has moved from buying one dollar forty cents on the lows of Thursday to buying $1.46 now... As one FX strategist said to me this morning: \u201cI\u2019d normally expect to see that size of move in a month\u201d. Ladbrokes and William Hill have also cut their odds on Remain winning Thursday\u2019s vote (meaning they see it as more likely) The Brexit referendum is already the biggest political betting event in Betfair\u2019s history (it was founded in 1999). Betfair spokesperson Naomi Totten reports that more than \u00a340m has now been staked on the result, including one \u00a3315,000 wager on Remain. Totten says: \u201cWith just three days left until the vote the Betfair market momentum is now all behind Remain, which was backed as low as 1/5 this morning, with one customer backing it to the tune of \u00a3100k. This market continues to mimic the pattern of the Scottish Referendum, where historical confidence in the eventual \u2018No\u2019 vote slipped slightly ten days before referendum day only to resettle in the week of the vote.\u201d One City fund manager, though, suggests investors shouldn\u2019t get carried away... City investment management company Charles Stanley has warned customers that they could find it harder to trade on Friday morning. They believe there will be massive demand to buy and sell shares and currencies, as the referendum result becomes clear. Here\u2019s an email sent to clients today: This Thursday \u2013 June 23rd2016 \u2013 the country goes to the polls to decide on Britain\u2019s future in Europe. It is a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 vote but we are expecting considerable volumes being traded through the Charles Stanley Direct platform as investors react to the news. Whatever the results, we anticipate that we may experience higher volumes and more market volatility than usual on the 23rd June and in the days following the vote. The immediate impact is likely to be felt most directly by those of you wishing to trade shares during such market conditions. It is possible that market makers will limit the size of orders that can be placed online and be slow to answer phones. In practice this may mean that you are more likely to have to place a limit order instead of a market order and it may take longer for us to be able to place such trades. Foreign exchange rates could also witness fluctuations and this has the potential to impact overseas trades placed during this time. We ask for your understanding if you are thus affected. Our experienced Edinburgh-based helpdesk may also receive a surge in call and query volumes. We will respond to queries as quickly and thoroughly as possible, but once again we would be grateful for the forbearance of our clients in the event of unusually high volumes. Here\u2019s the best-performing major shares in London this lunchtime: Time for a catch-up. London\u2019s stock market is on a tear this morning, as investors react to signs that Britain is more likely to vote to stay in the European Union. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares has surged by 196 points, or 3.2%, by lunchtime in the City. That means around \u00a350bn has been wiped back onto the index, which is on track for its biggest one-day rise since last August. Financial stocks are among the big risers, with Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 7.8% and Lloyds Banking Group up 6%. Building firms are also up, led by Taylor Wimpey (up 7%). Traders are citing weekend polls, showing a pick-up in support for the Remain campaign in the last few days. Three polls gave Remain a small lead, and one had the two sides tied. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s markets opened with a strong risk-on sentiment as news over the weekend suggests that the Remain camp is gaining momentum in the UK ahead of this week\u2019s EU referendum\u201d. Betfair, the online gambling site, reports that the \u2018implied odds\u2019 of the UK remaining in the EU have risen to around 77%. This has forced some investors to cut insurance which they\u2019d taken out against Brexit. Sterling is also bouncing back, and on track for its biggest one-day rise since 2009. The pound is up by 1.8% right now at $1.4622 against the US dollar, a gain of over 2.5 cents. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have suggested that some voters are returning to the \u2018status quo\u2019, and deciding against Brexit. Others have warned, though, that there could be further twists before Thursday\u2019s vote. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, \u2018Waves from the Brexit vote are buffeting the UK stock market, tossing it up and down as the opinion polls shift this way and that. Until the vote is over we can expect more price swings, as markets struggle to price in a unique event that carries with it such a high degree of uncertainty. If you want to get an idea of what stocks will do well in the event of a vote to stay in the UK, it\u2019s worth taking a look at today\u2019s FTSE leader board. The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe. The move comes after David Cameron urged the public to \u201cstay and fight\u201d in the EU last night. Overnight, a clutch of Nobel-prize winning economists warned against Brexit. And the head of Germany\u2019s trade body has warned that it would be a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 if Britain left the EU. Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how the share prices of Europe\u2019s largest 600 companies (dark blue) have tracked the twists and turns in the EU referendum race. The latest opinion polls are prompting some international investors to readjust their views on the EU referendum - for the second time this month. Initially, the City had broadly expected the Remain campaign to win the vote, before polls in early June showed Leave taking the lead. So polls over the weekend, suggesting it\u2019s neck-and-neck again, have triggered today\u2019s rally. Christian Gattiker, head of research at Julius Baer in Zurich, told Bloomberg that sentiment has shifted: \u201cWe were steering into a clear Brexit scenario and now we\u2019ve seen a counter move which makes it more balanced, more in line with what investors thought in the first place. \u201d So, some traders who had protected themselves against Brexit are now \u2018unwinding\u2019 those positions - helping to drive the pound up. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The bias in the city has generally been that a Remain vote is more likely, but polls pointing otherwise meant that assertion needed to be hedged. The unusually large jump in Sterling on Monday is in part, those hedges being unwound. The US stock market is also expected to open strongly, in around four hours time: The rally is gathering pace, as investors worldwide shake off their recent fears. After two hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is up a mighty 160 points, or 2.5%, at 6181. That\u2019s its highest level since June 10th, and its biggest once-day rally since 17 February. And the pound is continuing to bounce - up almost three cents at $1.4628, and well away from the two-month lows ($1.40) hit last week. Traders are continuing to respond to polls showing a pick-up in support for Remain. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, comments: It is clear that the \u2018remain\u2019 campaign has suffered from a distinct lack of a positive message, with critics accusing the campaign leaders of fearmongering. However, in some ways, it took the tragic death of Jo Cox for people to wake up to the positive message that she purveyed on the benefits of integration and tolerance. Perhaps it is a coincidence, but that incident has seemingly formed a turning point for the \u2018remain\u2019 campaign, with the improved fortunes of both polls and the pound ever since. Reminder, our main EU referendum liveblog will be covering the recall of parliament today to pay tribute to Jo Cox MP: The head of Germany\u2019s BGA trade federation has declared that Brexit would be a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 for Europe\u2019s economy. Anton Boerner told a press conference in Berlin that: \u201cA Brexit would lead to uncertainty and a loss of trust over several years. This is poison for the economy in Britain, but also for Europe as a whole. Nobody will benefit from an exit. On the contrary, it would be a catastrophe for everybody and especially for us in Germany. There will be no winners, but only losers.\u201d Last night, 10 top Nobel Prize-winning economists predicted that Brexit would create major uncertainty, hurting global trade. UKIP\u2019s Nigel Farage, though, told the BBC this morning that Brexit wouldn\u2019t be a major shock to the economy as European countries would be keen to strike a trade deal quickly. Last night, prime minister David Cameron tried to persuade voters to back his campaign to remain in a reformed European Union. The PM told a special edition of Question Time that he believes Britain should \u201cstay and fight\u201d, rather than quitting the EU. At one point, Cameron declared: \u201cAt my office, I sit two yards away from the cabinet room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler, the greatest decision that anyone has ever made in our country. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons this is helping to push the pound up today: Sterling has pared any losses we saw last week. PM Cameron appeared on Question Time yesterday, answering questions from the public regarding the impending referendum and support for \u2018Remain\u2019 has seen the currency strengthen. Despite today\u2019s rally, the markets are still in a relatively precarious position, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: The slightest sign that the public are shifting in favour of Vote Leave will likely see today\u2019s gains rapidly dissipate, while an intensification of pre-referendum nerves as the week goes on could see markets chop and change even without any new polling news. Sterling is on course to post its strongest day since the aftermath of the financial crisis. The pound is holding onto its early gains, and is up 1.6% against the US dollar at $1.458 right now. That\u2019s a really chunky move for sterling \u2013 according to Reuters data, such a big swing hasn\u2019t happened since 2009. Our friends at fastFT confirm that today\u2019s rally is one of the biggest of the last decade: There are still two referendum debates to look forward to... Today\u2019s stock market rally looks decisive, but we\u2019ll probably see more market turmoil in the next few days Kit Juckes, the experienced foreign exchange expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: Polls remain very even, with the FT\u2019s poll tracker showing both camps at 44%. The market will surely gyrate some more in the next few days as any shift in that position triggers an exaggerated reaction, not just for sterling but for wider risk sentiment. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says there is a global rush into \u2018risky\u2019 assets today. \u201cThe British Pound soared at the start of the week and the Euro followed upward after new polling data released over the weekend showed ebbing support for \u201cBrexit\u201d at this week\u2019s UK EU membership referendum. Survation reported a 45 to 42 preference for a \u201cRemain\u201d vote while an analogous poll from YouGov gave the status quo a 44 to 43 percent lead. \u201cThe outcomes likewise bolstered risk appetite. The sentiment-linked Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars tracked stocks upward while the anti-risk Japanese Yen plunged. The likewise haven-linked US Dollar is also under pressure. Gold prices and US 10-year Treasury futures likewise swooned as capital flowed away from safety-seeking assets. Here\u2019s the best-performing shares in the City this morning: The London stock market has hit its highest level since 10 June, as this morning\u2019s rally wipes out recent losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has surged by 136 points at the start of trading, as City investors react to the polls showing the Remain campaign gaining ground. Almost every share is gaining ground, as money pours back into shares, pushing the benchmark index up by over 2%. Royal Bank of Scotland, the taxpayer-owned bank, is leading the rally with a 6% surge. Lloyds Banking Group are up 5%. And housebuilders are also leading the charge \u2013 they had suffered from fears that Brexit would mean less demand for housing, especially if the UK entered recession. Mike van Dulken, analyst at Accendo Markets, explains: A positive European open comes as weekend Brexit polls (and bookies\u2019 odds) suggest the Remain campaign regaining some lost ground and in some cases re-taken the lead ahead of Thursday\u2019s UK referendum vote on EU membership. A higher chance of the UK voting to stay is a relief for markets (equities and the pound sterling) that had been preparing themselves for a Leave vote and the uncertainty it could inflict from both a financial, economic and political standpoint. In Europe, the French and German stock markets both leapt by around 2.4% at the open. And we\u2019re off! European stock markets are opening sharply higher, with financial stocks leading the way...... Today\u2019s newspaper front pages show how the EU referendum campaign picked up last night: Sterling is rallying hard this morning - another sign that Brexit worries are easing. The pound has jumped more than two cents, or 1.5%, to $1.4572, after weekend opinion polls showed the Remain campaign picking up more support. That\u2019s its highest level since June 7, before opinion polls showed the Leave campaign in the ascendant. Against the euro, the pound has gained 1% or 1.2 eurocents to \u20ac1.2848. That means one euro is worth 77.8p. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say investors are reacting to the latest opinion polls: In the UK, there were three surveys released over the weekend that all showed some swing back towards \u2018Remain\u2019. The Survation poll showed a 45/42 lead for \u2018Remain\u2019 (up from 42/45 previously), a YouGov Poll showed a 44/42 lead (42/44 previously) while Opinium stood at 44/44 equal split. Those polls were all conducted around the tragic events of last week - with some responses coming in before and some after the murder of Jo Cox. Thus, it might be possible that the events influenced the polls but most experts commented that it is more likely that an expected and well documented \u2018pull to the status-quo\u2019 is responsible for the latest swing. The poll-of-polls averaging the last six polls has returned to 50/50 while the bookmakers\u2019 odds for Brexit have fallen considerably to around 30% again. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest referendum opinion polls (from our EU referendum liveblog): A Sunday Times/YouGov poll had remain on 44% and leave on 43%. An Opinium/Observer poll put both campaigns on 44%. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday had remain ahead, by 45% to 42%. A UK-wide BMG poll for the Herald showed a bigger gap, with remain up to 53.3% and leave on 46.7%. A Comres poll for the Independent didn\u2019t ask those surveyed how they would vote \u2013 but 44% said they would be \u201cdelighted\u201d if the UK voted to leave the EU, with only 28% saying they\u2019d celebrate a vote to stay with the same fervour. The FT poll of polls now pegs remain and leave on 44% apiece. Stock markets across Asia have soared today, as investors grew more confident that the British public will vote to remain in the EU. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index led the way, gaining almost 2.3% today. The Nikkei is often a good barometer of investor sentiment -- liable to tumble when nervous traders drive up the value of the Japanese Yen (hurting the country\u2019s exporters and raising deflation fears). The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is close behind, up 1.8%, as is Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index. Although these trading floors are thousands of miles from the UK, Britain\u2019s referendum is still top of the agenda. Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, explains: The entire market is now focused on the UK\u2019s EU referendum result.... It is expected that a vote to remain would lead to a quick unwinding of risk premium and a substantial risk-on rally, whereas a Brexit vote would have the opposite effect.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a crucial week for investors around the globe, as the long-running UK referendum campaign enters its final days. And London\u2019s financial markets are expected to soar, following weekend polling showing that the campaign to Remain in the European Union is making up ground. Asian stock markets have rallied strongly overnight, and it looks like Europe will follow suit at 8am. IG are predicting that the FTSE 100 will soar by nearly 3% at the open \u2013 a really big move - as fears of a Brexit ease. The pound is also rallying in early trading, hitting a two week high (more on that shortly) This may be premature...... there are still three days to go until the vote. Campaigning resumed last night, following a two-day break following the awful, tragic death of Jo Cox MP on Thursday. Our main EU referendum blog will be tracking all the key political developments in the referendum today, including tributes to Jo Cox and her work in parliament: There\u2019s not much else in the economic or financial calendar, so the City should be free to watch the referendum campaign enter its final lap. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main economic and financial news through the day....",

Along a broad based sell-off across markets, Brent crude sold 11% off from the recent peak of $52.86 a barrel to a low last week of $46.94. There was a clear exit from long speculative positions and an increase in short positions in WTI crude [the US benchmark].</p> <p>In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity. The sharp rebound in the oil price during the last two days is a good indication of the solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50 a barrel. While a Brexit would be damaging for the Brent crude price in the short term, we think that its impact on oil demand would only be marginally negative. While overall sentiment in financial markets could be depressed for quite some time, the supply/demand balance for oil would not be impacted very much.</p> <p>If we get a second negative round of sell-off ahead of the vote this week, with Brent crude down towards $45 a barrel, we view it as a good buying opportunity. If a Brexit then actually happens, Brent crude would sell further down, but it would not stay there long.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efbac432058bdffab9fb8939e26b277b7912ee9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efbac432058bdffab9fb8939e26b277b7912ee9f/0_192_5106_3065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil worker in Bahrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil worker in Bahrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hasan Jamali/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5767f9f4e4b0412970e2c108\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-20T14:15:00.477Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street, the market has now indeed settled down, and the optimism continues.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 252 points or 1.4%, while European markets are holding on to the bulk of their gains.</p> <p>In the general risk-on attitude among investors, oil is also on the rise, with Brent crude up 1.6% at $49.97 a barrel.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5767f89ce4b0fa9ae41007aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-20T14:10:42.064Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Carmaker Nissan has said it will take legal action against the official Leave campaign for using its logo in a leaflet calling on voters to back Brexit.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There seems to be some truth in the old saying that the third time\u2019s the charm, at least when it comes to Philadelphia\u2019s passage of a soda tax. After two previous attempts failed, on 16 June Philadelphia\u2019s city council voted to pass a tax of 1.5 cents per ounce on both regular and diet soda beverages. Soda sales and their impact on the epidemic of obesity are a hot topic across the US, and much of the world. Philadelphia is the fifth-largest city in the US and the largest to successfully pass such a proposal. Only tiny, liberal bastion Berkeley, California, had passed a plan until last week. Since 2008, some 43 other taxes have been proposed in cities and municipalities and all have failed, faced down by the powerful drinks\u2019 lobby. Soda sales are declining \u2013 in the US they soon look set to be outstripped by sales of bottled water. But still 17% of Americans drink soda at least once every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And consumption is higher among black and Hispanic Americans and in southern states, where obesity is also above average. Experts see Philadelphia\u2019s success, and the innovative strategy it adopted to get there, as a sign that other cities will soon follow. \u201cThis is an important harbinger of what is going to come and people in Philadelphia will see this as important part of their history,\u201d predicted Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who is an advocate of the soda tax. Historically, the idea for a soda tax first came up in the context of improving health, Brownell said. But initiatives that focused on the tax as a means to cut consumption for health reasons have met with derision and failed. Americans don\u2019t like being told what to do and the soda lobby has used that to its advantage. Recasting the tax as a budget issue, as Philadelphia\u2019s mayor Jim Kenney did, has proved more palatable. The tax, which is projected to bring in $91m in the first year, will be used to pay for expanding pre-K as well as improving parks, libraries and recreation centers. Philadelphia has high fixed costs which made it difficult to find revenue to pay for expanding pre-K in the city, explains Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Kenney. The mayor did not want to raise property taxes again, said Hitt, so the soda tax was settled on as an alternative revenue source to help fund pre-K expansion. David Goldberg, spokesman for Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda tax initiatives, predicts that San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California as well as Boulder, Colorado, will all pass similar taxes this year in the wake of Philadelphia\u2019s success. A number of other cities are now in the primary stages of considering the tax as well, he adds. The American Beverage Association (ABA), the lobbying group for soda manufacturers, which strongly opposes the tax, has said it will \u201ctake legal action to stop it\u201d, according to spokeswoman Lauren Kane. The ABA has referred to the tax as \u201cregressive\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d, noting that \u201csimilar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years, including twice in Philadelphia\u201d. A tax can be regressive if a larger percentage of a poor person\u2019s income goes into acquiring an item, or a lower income bracket is taxed at a higher rate than a higher income bracket. Philadelphia feels confident about its legal standing, said Hitt, noting that the city\u2019s lawyers vetted the proposal and addressed all the arguments that the ABA has raised. The US has many regressive taxes, and being regressive alone does not make a tax impermissible, explained Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, citing examples of other regressive taxes such as tobacco and alcohol taxes which impact the poor disproportionately more than the better off. Goldberg argues that it makes sense that a tax that impacts poorer communities, would also be the one that benefits those communities by expanding early education for children. It was a smart policy decision by Philadelphia\u2019s mayor to \u201ccarve out some of the industry profits that have come out of poor communities primarily and put them back into the community to benefit the future prospect of kids in those poorer communities\u201d, Goldberg said. Other legal arguments raised include those around Pennsylvania\u2019s constitution, which has a uniformity clause. The uniformity clause means all items in a certain class must be taxed at the same rate, so for example all real estate, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial is taxed at the same rate. So if a tax is imposed, all beverages, including bottled water, could be seen as one class. Sweetened beverages, Hitt argues, are a distinct class because of their negative health effects. The case could \u201cfor sure\u201d go to court and may take a couple of years to resolve, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. In the meantime, the ABA would seek a stay pending litigation, which it may or may not be granted, explains Briffault. Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014. Soda consumption in Berkeley was already low before the tax. The ABA did not challenge Berkeley\u2019s soda tax, underscoring the impact Philadelphia\u2019s tax is expected to have on similar measures in other cities. \u201cIf the Philly tax didn\u2019t mean anything, the soda industry would not have plunked more than $4m into fighting it and promised more in implied bribes,\u201d says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. While Philadelphia works to implement its tax, which is slated to go into effect in January 2017, other cities are taking note of its successful strategy. \u201cThere is great public support for tax funds earmarked for social purposes,\u201d says Nestle. Focusing on soda taxes as a revenue source also brings \u201ca whole other group of political figures to the mix\u201d, points out Brownell. Previously, only politicians focused on health would get involved with soda tax proposals, but the new strategy brings in politicians who are looking for new revenue generating possibilities for projects for their constituents, explains Brownell. \u201cMy guess is that the floodgates will open pretty quickly, Brownell says.",

      "body": "<p>There seems to be some truth in the old saying that the third time\u2019s the charm, at least when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/16/philadelphia-passes-soda-tax-first-city-sugar\">Philadelphia\u2019s passage of a soda tax</a>. After two previous attempts failed, on 16 June Philadelphia\u2019s city council voted to pass a tax of 1.5 cents per ounce on both regular and diet soda beverages. </p> <p>Soda sales and their impact on the epidemic of obesity are a hot topic across the US, and much of the world. Philadelphia is the fifth-largest city in the US and the largest to successfully pass such a proposal. Only tiny, liberal bastion Berkeley, California, had passed a plan until last week. Since 2008, some 43 other taxes have been proposed in cities and municipalities and all have failed, faced down by the powerful drinks\u2019 lobby. </p> <p>Soda sales are declining \u2013 in the US they soon look set to be outstripped by sales of bottled water. But still <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6332a2.htm\">17% of Americans drink soda </a>at least once every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And consumption is higher among black and Hispanic Americans and in southern states, where obesity is also above average. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/soft-drinks-consumption/\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/soft-drinks-consumption/\">interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Experts see Philadelphia\u2019s success, and the innovative strategy it adopted to get there, as a sign that other cities will soon follow. \u201cThis is an important harbinger of what is going to come and people in Philadelphia will see this as important part of their history,\u201d predicted Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, who is an advocate of the soda tax.<br></p> <p>Historically, the idea for a soda tax first came up in the context of improving health, Brownell said. But initiatives that focused on the tax as a means to cut consumption for health reasons have met with derision and failed. Americans don\u2019t like being told what to do and the soda lobby has used that to its advantage.</p> <p>Recasting the tax as a budget issue, as Philadelphia\u2019s mayor Jim Kenney did, has proved more palatable. The tax, which is projected to bring in $91m in the first year, will be used to pay for expanding pre-K as well as improving parks, libraries and recreation centers. Philadelphia has high fixed costs which made it difficult to find revenue to pay for expanding pre-K in the city, explains Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Kenney. The mayor did not want to raise property taxes again, said Hitt, so the soda tax was settled on as an alternative revenue source to help fund pre-K expansion.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>David Goldberg, spokesman for Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda tax initiatives, predicts that San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, California as well as Boulder, Colorado, will all pass similar taxes this year in the wake of Philadelphia\u2019s success. A number of other cities are now in the primary stages of considering the tax as well, he adds.<br></p> <p>The American Beverage Association (ABA), the lobbying group for soda manufacturers, which strongly opposes the tax, has said it will \u201ctake legal action to stop it\u201d, according to spokeswoman Lauren Kane. The ABA has referred to the tax as \u201cregressive\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d, noting that \u201csimilar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years, including twice in Philadelphia\u201d. A tax can be regressive if a larger percentage of a poor person\u2019s income goes into acquiring an item, or a lower income bracket is taxed at a higher rate than a higher income bracket.<br></p> <p>Philadelphia feels confident about its legal standing, said Hitt, noting that the city\u2019s lawyers vetted the proposal and addressed all the arguments that the ABA has raised. The US has many regressive taxes, and being regressive alone does not make a tax impermissible, explained Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting, citing examples of other regressive taxes such as tobacco and alcohol taxes which impact the poor disproportionately more than the better off.<br></p> <p>Goldberg argues that it makes sense that a tax that impacts poorer communities, would also be the one that benefits those communities by expanding early education for children. It was a smart policy decision by Philadelphia\u2019s mayor to \u201ccarve out some of the industry profits that have come out of poor communities primarily and put them back into the community to benefit the future prospect of kids in those poorer communities\u201d, Goldberg said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Other legal arguments raised include those around Pennsylvania\u2019s constitution, which has a uniformity clause. The uniformity clause means all items in a certain class must be taxed at the same rate, so for example all real estate, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial is taxed at the same rate. So if a tax is imposed, all beverages, including bottled water, could be seen as one class. Sweetened beverages, Hitt argues, are a distinct class because of their negative health effects.<br></p> <p>The case could \u201cfor sure\u201d go to court and may take a couple of years to resolve, said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. In the meantime, the ABA would seek a stay pending litigation, which it may or may not be granted, explains Briffault.<br></p> <p>Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014.

      "bodyText": "The competition regulator is preparing to drop its earlier judgment that Britain\u2019s largest energy providers overcharge customers by \u00a31.7bn a year. After two years compiling it, the Competition and Markets Authority is due to publish its report into the energy market on 24 June. It is expected to omit the claim that the big six providers charged customers \u00a31.7bn too much a year between 2009 and 2013, the Financial Times reported (partial paywall). The CMA had said the overcharging was particularly damaging for vulnerable groups without the means or will to shop around. The claim, made in an interim report last July, will be replaced by a statement that households and small and medium-sized businesses could have saved that amount if they had switched provider, the FT said. The energy companies, including British Gas and SSE, were furious about the \u00a31.7bn figure, which they called misleading, and have lobbied hard for the CMA to change its stance. They have said the energy market is highly competitive and that their profits are in line with the risks they take. The regulator has already been criticised for watering down its initial proposals. It has called for a price cap on tariffs covering 4 million households on prepaid meters but it has not widened the cap to cover customers stuck on expensive standard variable tariffs. The CMA inquiry was established to clear up whether SSE, Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power, British Gas-owner Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy were abusing their dominance of the market. But the regulator has retreated from more radical proposals including the extreme option of breaking up the big operators. The watchdog opened its inquiry in 2014 in response to growing unrest about energy costs and the opposition Labour party\u2019s pledge to freeze bills and restructure the industry if it won last year\u2019s general election. The big energy companies were prepared to challenge the CMA in court over the \u00a31.7bn claim but the change of wording will remove that threat, the FT reported.

      "bodyText": "Majestic Wine has increased underlying sales for the first time in four years after scrapping its minimum purchase and stocking more English wine, craft beers and spirits. Retail sales at stores open a year or more rose 4.8% in the year to 28 March compared to a year earlier, as active customer numbers increased 12% to 775,000. Total sales increased 11% to \u00a3402.1m, including those from Naked Wines, which Majestic bought in April 2015. Naked Wines is an online retailer that lets subscribers fund independent winemakers in exchange for purchases of exclusive wines at preferential prices. Its founder, Rowan Gormley, became Majestic\u2019s chief executive when the sale occurred. Gormley has pledged to revive Majestic, Britain\u2019s biggest specialist wine retailer, after several years of disappointing results. He ditched a minimum six-bottle purchase left over from its days as a warehouse, simplified prices and updated the range of drinks. Pre-tax profit fell 75% to \u00a34.7m, with money being spent on Gormley\u2019s revamp and increased borrowing costs linked to the purchase of Naked Wines. It also paid \u00a37.3m in shares to Gormley and his team as part of the deal, which were counted as one-off profit deductions. Majestic\u2019s shares have risen 50% this year and were up 2.7% at 450p in late morning trading on Monday. Gormley said examples of improvements to Majestic\u2019s range included replacing some French regional wines with increasingly fashionable English wines. \u201cThere are a lot of interesting French regional wines but we had far too many. There is increasing demand for English wine and the quality of supply has improved to the point where there are lots of good products to put on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also gone much bigger on craft spirits and craft beer because they are categories that are growing and where people like to get advice, which is what Majestic does best.\u201d Naked Wines\u2019 sales rose 27% to \u00a3104m and the business made its first profit \u2013 of \u00a31m \u2013 since it was launched in 2008. It sells wines from 152 producers in 14 countries and has 300,500 customers. Gormley said the results showed his plan was taking effect but that Majestic would continue to face fierce competition. Supermarkets have used wine offers to lure customers but Gormley said he would not get dragged into crude price cuts that were not viable in the long run. He said: \u201cTrading conditions have been tough for a while and we expect them to remain tough. There is no sales growth in the market so we can only get growth at the expense of others and they are tough, experienced competitors, so that\u2019s hard.\u201d Gormley\u2019s other changes include making life easier for employees in stores, increasing pay and giving branch managers bigger bonuses for doing well. Longer-term improvements in his three-year plan include revamping computer systems to provide staff with more information about customer preferences.",

      "bodyText": "With financial shares heading higher as Brexit fears recede, Aberdeen Asset Management is among the biggest gainers. The company, more than 5% better at 281.5p, has been the subject of takeover speculation recently, and analysts at Numis have taken a look at possible buyers and a takeout price. In short, major global asset managers and 380p a share or \u00a35bn respectively. Numis said: Following recent press speculation that the company is up for sale and a number of parties have taken an informal look, as well as our recent note highlighting the scope for an increased level of sector M&amp;A (given a weak organic earnings growth outlook), we have taken a look at who we think could buy Aberdeen and how much we think they could pay. We conclude that an acquirer would need to be fairly large (probably a global top 40 asset manager to have at least equal scale with Aberdeen and allow scope for reasonable cost synergies), have willingness to acquire / access to capital (ruling out some of the bank owned asset managers), have some similarity in investment approach / business model / culture and would probably lack a significant emerging markets/Asia franchise but would want one (Aberdeen\u2019s key strategic asset that most companies would want exposure to long term in our view). Whilst a PE deal is possible, given the lower scope for cost synergies and lesser desire to own an emerging markets franchise long term, we see these as less likely participants. We believe a realistic take out value would be around \u00a35.0bn/380p per share (around 40% above the current market value). Numis lists a range of possible suitors: Blackrock, JP Morgan, Capital, PIMCO, Amundi, Natixis, Invesco, T. Rowe, Legg Mason, AMG, Sumitomo Mitsui, Ameriprise, AllianceBernstein, Standard Life, Pru/M&amp;G, Credit Suisse, Mitsubishi, Macquarie and Aviva.",

      "bodyText": "Next is likely to see an improvement in performance after a disappointing first quarter due to the cold weather, according to City analysts. Notwithstanding the current downpours, the better weather in May is likely to give the fashion retailer a boots, says Michelle Wilson at Berenberg. But further out she believes Next will have to close stores as the Directory continues to steal sales from the high street. Cutting earnings forecasts and target price but retaining a hold recommendation, Wilson says: The introduction of a mobile-adapted website in March and normalising weather conditions in May will remove much of the temporary headwinds that have weighed on Next\u2019s recent performance in our view. However, over the longer term, we believe Next\u2019s changing customer base presents a significant structural challenge. As Directory growth continues to cannibalise Retail sales growth, we believe management must close stores in favour of offering free home delivery or face continuing revenue pressure. Concurrently, the shift in mix from higher-spending, more profitable account customers to less-loyal cash customers is also having a negative impact on revenue growth and profitability. As management continues to protect profitability over market share, we cut our earnings per share estimates by 6%/5%/5% in 2017/2018/2019 respectively, driven by weaker revenue expectations. We cut our price target to \u00a348 from \u00a373 and re- iterate our hold rating. In more detail, Berenberg says: Store estate is squeezing profitability: Next Retail like for like sales have been negative in all but one of the last five years. With 55% of Next\u2019s Directory orders collected from store, we believe Directory growth is simply cannibalising Next\u2019s Retail revenues and putting pressure on margins. To offset the impact on profit, management has opened larger, more efficient stores, offering free click-and-collect and charging for home delivery. While this continued space expansion is positive for profit growth in the near term, we believe a better allocation of capital would be to close stores in favour of free home delivery. Home delivery sales are declining: We estimate that Next Directory home delivery revenues have declined by around 6% per annum over the last four years. Historically, this decline has been more than offset by an increase in click- and-collect orders; however, we believe that as i) consumers have become increasingly comfortable with shopping online and ii) the online proposition of retail peers has improved, consumer preference has increasingly shifted to home delivery. As such, we believe UK Directory growth will remain challenging for Next as management continues to protect margins. Offering free home delivery would be painful in the short term, diluting Directory EBIT margin by around 4 percentage points, but it is essential to adapt to changing consumer demands in our view. Loyal account customers are declining: Next account customers spend around \u00a3476 per annum with Next, of which we believe \u00a3404 is from product sales. This compares to an average cash customer spend of \u00a3210. The near- term negative impact of a decline in the number of account customers has been offset by the rising debts of the account customers that remain. Our concern is that this trend is unsustainable. As a result, Next may face further revenue pressure and an increase in bad debts.",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk paid its chief executive, Dido Harding, an extra \u00a31.8m last year when the telecoms company suffered a cyber-attack that cost it \u00a360m and 101,000 customers. Baroness Harding received \u00a32.81m for 2015, up from \u00a31.05m the year before, the company\u2019s annual report showed. Her pay, including \u00a3550,000 salary, increased because of a \u00a31.97m payout under TalkTalk\u2019s long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The payment covered TalkTalk\u2019s performance from 2012 to 2015 and was half the maximum Harding might have received. Harding\u2019s cash bonus almost halved to \u00a3220,000 from \u00a3432,000 \u2013 a cut the company said was due to the cyber-attack. Harding has donated the bonus to the charity Ambitious about Autism in recognition of the problems caused by the cyber-attack. She would have been eligible for \u00a3343,000 under the terms of the bonus plan but \u201cin the context of the cyber-attack on TalkTalk and after careful consideration, the remuneration committee has exercised discretion and determined that the annual bonus should be at a reduced level\u201d, the company said. TalkTalk revealed Harding\u2019s pay arrangements as MPs on the culture, media and sport committee called for chief executives\u2019 earnings to be linked to the security of their company\u2019s computer systems. Their report criticised TalkTalk\u2019s lack of preparation for a large cyber-attack. TalkTalk\u2019s computer systems were hacked in October in what was originally feared to be a mass raid on customers\u2019 personal data. The attack proved to be less widespread than first believed, with about 4% of the company\u2019s 4 million customers affected and no financial loss to customers despite the partial disclosure of payment details. After TalkTalk was slow to notify customers and the data protection watchdog, Harding took to the airwaves to limit the damage and gained credit for taking personal responsibility for the attack. She admitted the company had underestimated the problem and promised to improve its operations. But customers were left seething by uncertainty created by the company\u2019s initial handling of the attack and its slack security systems. TalkTalk also refused to let people terminate contracts without incurring charges, and instead offered them a free upgrade, which almost half a million customers took up. In the annual report, Sir Charles Dunstone, TalkTalk\u2019s chairman, said the company had recovered strongly since the cyber-attack. \u201cBy communicating honestly with our customers to help them protect themselves, we not only set a new standard of openness and transparency for large businesses dealing with such challenges, we also demonstrated that TalkTalk is a business brave enough to put our customers\u2019 interests first.\u201d The culture, media and sport committee published a report based on its investigation triggered by TalkTalk\u2019s security breach. Harding gave evidence to the inquiry in December. The MPs said TalkTalk had not done enough to prepare for an attack on its systems and slowness to protect computer systems was weak across British industry. They recommended measures including: A chief executive\u2019s pay should be based partly on maintaining effective cybersecurity to reduce the chances of a crisis. Companies should appoint an officer with day-to-day responsibility for protecting computer systems from attack. It should be easier for consumers to claim compensation if they are the subject of a data breach. Companies should report on their cybersecurity measures and show they have identified and dealt with weaknesses if a breach occurs. Jesse Norman, the committee\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cFailure to prepare for or learn from cyber-attacks, and failure to inform and protect consumers, must draw sanctions serious enough to act as a real incentive and deterrent. \u201cAs the TalkTalk case shows, the reality is that cyber-attacks are a constant, evolving threat. TalkTalk responded quickly and well to this attack, but appear to have been much less effective in the past, failing to learn from repeated breaches of different kinds.\u201d Norman said TalkTalk should release details of a report the company commissioned from PwC into its security systems as soon as possible. He also said a report by the information commissioner was taking too long and that the agency appeared to be understaffed.",

      "bodyText": "With the Remain campaign regaining some ground ahead of this week\u2019s referendum on whether the UK stays in the European Union, leading shares and sterling have bounced decisively back from recent lows. But as investors move once more into riskier assets, gold and silver miners are being left out in the cold. Randgold Resources is down 135p or 2% at \u00a364.75 while Fresnillo has fallen 6p to \u00a312.21, the only two losers in the leading index. Overall though the FTSE 100 has jumped more than 2% or 132.22 points to 6153.31 with financial groups and housebuilders - which had been hit hard by fears of Brexit - among the leading risers. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: UK financials and property are outperforming this morning on the back of weekend Brexit polls showing a shift back in favour of Remain. This has resulted in a surge in buying interest for the pound sterling and a relief rally for battered financials (banks, insurance) and housebuilders as investors price in a lower probability of event-risk attached to a UK exit from the European Union. Polls last week suggested the Leave camp taking an increasing lead which sent the currency and UK equities significantly lower given the more uncertain outlook The weekend news has thus served as a starting pistol for investors to wade in and start bargain hunting, re-fuelling hopes that the status quo will prevail. And while last Thursday\u2019s tragic murder of Jo Cox look is being singled out as a turning point in the campaign, note some of the aforementioned poll data was taken before the MPs death. This suggests the swing in opinion may not simply be one of sympathy. It could be a combination of this and voter fatigue with the electorate tiring of an increasingly ugly debate. Royal Bank of Scotland is 15.4p higher at 237.5p and Lloyds Banking Group has been lifted 3.51p to 68.56p. Hargreaves Lansdown has added 86p to 313.15. Taylor Wimpey has climbed 11p to 187p while Barratt Developments is 32.5p better at 564p. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline has risen 23.5p to \u00a314.11 after it said its combination treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had met its goals in a late stage study. But biotech group Circassia Pharmaceuticals has collapsed 64% to 95.55p after its experimental cat allergy treatment failed in a phase 3 study. Numis said: This result is both surprising and hugely disappointing given the consistency of response on top of placebo in previous Phase 2 studies. Circassia has taken immediate steps to reduce investment in the allergy portfolio and will focus on continuing the strong growth of the NIOX asthma management franchise and establishing its specialty commercial infrastructure in the US and Europe. Additional data will be presented on the conference call, with a business update due in the coming weeks. Our target price and recommendation is now under review.",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull certainly seems to have picked the right date to call the election, because the latest employment figures suggest that employment growth has hit a wall \u2013 especially for full-time employment. But it won\u2019t be much of an issue in the election since the unemployment rate has remained stable purely because people have given up looking for work. The big number from the May labour force figures released last week was that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.7% \u2013 the same level as at the 2013 election: But the unemployment rate disguises the actual picture of the employment situation, which has deteriorated rather drastically since the end of last year. In May total employment grew by just 3,700 (0.03% in trend terms) \u2013 the weakest performance since October 2013. Full-time employment fell by 0.11%, making it the fourth month in a row where full-time employment has gone backwards. Also going backwards were the hours worked. That dropped by 0.14% \u2013 making five months in a row of falling full-time work. The only good news was that part-time employment rose by 0.3%, but even this is off its peak: The growth of part-time employment \u2013 and the very poor full-time employment growth in keeping with the growth of employment under the Abbott/Turnbull government. Since September 2013 full-time employment has grown by 183,000 while part-time employment has increased by 285,100. So although 68% of people work full time, the share of full-time employment has made up just 39% of employment growth since the last election. The greatest disparity is male full-time employment which accounts for 44% of all people employed, and yet which makes up just 13% of new jobs since September 2013: This greater growth of part-time employment is something that began early in 2013 and has been exacerbated throughout the Abbott/Turnbull government: This growth of part-time employment is something that has particularly affected prime-aged workers between 25 and 64. Full-time employment growth for prime-aged workers has actually been worse under the Abbott/Turnbull government than under the Gillard government: Part-time employment has been much stronger under Abbott/Turnbull. Youth employment has also done better under the Abbott/Turnbull governments but again this is very much supported by part-time employment, with full-time youth employment falling since September 2013 (just not falling as badly as during the Gillard government years): The overall picture however remains one where employment growth is coming to a halt. The annual growth of hours worked is now down to just 0.5% \u2013 the slowest since the start of 2013, and it not an arbiter of good times ahead: Malcolm Turnbull is fortunate that the poor employment growth has not flowed through to a higher unemployment rate. Largely the steady unemployment rate is due to the decline in the proportion of people in the labour force. In November last year the participation rate was 65.2% (seasonally adjusted) and 65.1% (trend); in May it was down to 64.8%. Had the participation rates stayed the same that would mean in May there would have been around 57,000 extra unemployed. Had that been the case the unemployment rate would be up to 6.2%: Now this does not mean the unemployment rate is false, but just that when we grab the big number, as is the case with the GDP, it pays to look at what is underneath the headline. Because we mostly judge the employment situation by the unemployment rate, last Thursday\u2019s figure neutered the issue in the election campaign. It\u2019s tough for the ALP to make the case things are bad but there\u2019s also not a lot for the government to brag about when the unemployment rate is the same as it was in September 2013. But the full-time employment issue is one that deserve much more focus than it currently gets. Yes the flexibility in the industrial relations system allows for a fall in hours worked that does not see a similar fall in employment. That happened in the global financial crisis and also in 2012 but the general push towards part-time employment is one that is also a longer term issue. Since November there has been a sharp drop in the average hours worked per adult and it\u2019s now at the lowest level since the 1990s recession: That doesn\u2019t mean our employment situation is as bad as then but because of the ageing population and the increase in part-time labour, the number of hours worked per adult in November 1993 when the unemployment rate was 10.7% is the same as now when the unemployment rate is 5.7%. And given income and by extension income tax is linked more closely to hours worked rather than total jobs, it means we need more people working than in the past to achieve the same national level of hours worked. And with greater reliance upon part-time work also comes the concern of less job security and less ability to provide a living income. At the last election Tony Abbott pledged 1m jobs in five years \u2013 I doubt anyone would have gotten too excited had he added \u201cand nearly two-thirds will be part-time\u201d. Part-time employment growth is not necessarily a bad thing \u2013 it is very good for young workers and for those raising children or studying. But an economy is always strongest when full-time employment is growing strongly. Right now that is not the case at all.",
