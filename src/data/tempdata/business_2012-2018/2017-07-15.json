      "bodyText": "At the moment one of the most visible industrial disputes in Australia is occurring between Cricket Australia and its players, represented by the Australian Cricketers Association. And while the issues at stake are complex, among the consequences is the issue of the marketing of players. But regardless of what the dispute might do to the ability for cricket players \u2013 or Cricket Australia \u2013 to make money hawking fast food chicken, the players\u2019 actions are a wonderful advertisement for joining a union. Union membership in this country is at historic lows. The latest figures suggest just 13% of all workers are in a trade union \u2013 25 years ago it was around 40%. In the private sector, the numbers are even lower. Just 9% of private sector workers are in a union. Let\u2019s not pretend that there is no link between this lack of representation and the record low wage growth we are currently experiencing. In the past year, private sector wages grew by just 1.7% but the average prices of health, education, utilities and automotive fuel all rose by more than double that amount, and the cost of fruit and vegetables by nearly 13%. So bad has the situation become that the governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, last month suggested workers needed to become more bold in their claims for wage rises. He argued that employees were most likely too fearful of losing hours should they seek higher wages. But while the theory that workers should not be afraid of seeking both more hours and higher wages sounds great in a panel discussion on the economy, the reality is such claims will not happen in a workforce with such meagre unionisation. And there is nothing coincidental about this \u2013 it is the backbone of every aspect of the Howard government\u2019s industrial relations policy \u2013 shift power from the workers to the employers and then vigorously decry any attempts to redress the balance as harmful to the economy. In such a context the ALP\u2019s recent move to enshrine penalty rates in law is a bold, and unfortunately necessary, step. But those workers who see penalty rates being reduced and wages growing at record lows and who are also not in a union could do worse than look to the Australian cricketers. The issues at stake in the contract dispute between the cricketers and their union, the Australia Cricketers Association, and Cricket Australia are pretty complex. Essentially they involve a shift from the way cricketers were compensated over the past 20 years \u2013 from players receiving a set share of Cricket Australia\u2019s revenue, to one where CA would pay players an amount unlinked from the revenue. The players are in favour of the current model because it in effect treats them as partners with CA rather than mere workers for hire. Now, to be honest, it does not matter whether or not you think the cricketers are wrong to challenge CA. I never have too much truck with those who complain about sports players earning too much money. I\u2019ll vote for the money to go to the workers over the bosses every day. But even if you think cricket players are paid more than enough, the effectiveness of their operating as a collective is apparent. Cricket Australia sought to change a longstanding industrial relations model that would see it get a greater share of money and tried to divide players in order to achieve these aims. It sought to split women and men by arguing the new arrangements would see all players the same hourly base rate of pay. That sounds fair until you realise that women don\u2019t play five-day tests, meaning they will effectively be on a lower base from the get-go. And is cricket really something that can be translated to an hourly wage, like workers producing widgets? Are three hours of test cricket really equal to three hours of one big-bash game? Were the players operating individually they would be stuffed. Individual contracts operating on different monetary scales and time frames would be used to ensure any individual could be left out of a team while the rest are unaffected. Test cricketers would be pitted against Big Bash players and shield players; men versus women \u2013 as indeed they have been. It\u2019s standard operating practice for such negotiations \u2013 sow discord and get workers scared they might lose hours, and so take less pay. Right now cricketers across the nation are unemployed. They are not on strike; they are just no longer employed by CA. As a result CA no longer owns their IP \u2013 meaning they can\u2019t force Steve Smith or Dave Warner to talk up the wonders of buckets of fried chicken. With an Ashes series looming, there is little doubt that CA believed it held the whip handle \u2013 that players would back down for fear of missing out on the series. But you only need to go on the ACA site to see how unified are the players within the ACA. They know that the impact of one player not playing in an Ashes series is greatly different from the entire team (and those in the state cricket system) not playing. It is a stark reminder that even if you are the best cricket players in the land \u2013 seemingly holding a skill that places you at an advantage compared with other workers in your field \u2013 your employer will seek to alter employment conditions to favour them. This is not to say unions are perfect \u2013 clearly there have been issues with governance and cases where the executive appears out of step with the members \u2013 such as on issues of same sex marriage in the Shop, Distributive &amp; Allied Employees\u2019 Association. But such matters will not be solved by not being part of a union. And neither will low wages. The old adage used to be the captain of the Australian men\u2019s Test team was the second most important position after the prime minister \u2013 and yet even Smith, holder of such a supposedly powerful position, also recognises the need to be a member of a union if he is to have any power in employment negotiations. Those of us who have nowhere near his power would be wise to follow his lead.",

      "bodyText": "One of the \u201clargest and most sophisticated datasets in the country\u201d \u2013 including the TV viewing, internet and phone records of 13 million households \u2013 could be misused for political purposes if Rupert Murdoch is allowed to proceed with his plan to buy out Sky, six members of the House of Lords claim in a letter to the Observer. The government\u2019s decision on whether to allow the takeover of the broadcaster by Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox may come as early as next week, but a cross-party group of peers led by the film-maker David Puttnam \u2013 who was involved in drafting the 2003 Telecommunications Act \u2013 have joined forces to highlight what they say is a significant oversight with potentially huge ramifications. Fox currently owns 39% of Sky. The letter says that \u201cSky possess what is probably the UK\u2019s largest and most sophisticated privately held domestic consumption database\u201d, able to \u201ctrack the leisure time preferences and behaviour\u201d of a large proportion of the population of the UK and Ireland.But the safety and security of that data is threatened, the letter says, if \u201cpassed into foreign control\u201d. It warns that should it \u201cfall into the hands of an owner with an appetite for political leverage, the temptations and opportunities for misuse become very great indeed\u201d. Puttnam said: \u201cThe deal would give unregulated access to this huge database from which an enormous amount of insight could be extracted. With that information, people can be individually targeted with advertisements personalised to them. And we have this unbelievable situation where we have no regulation of political advertisements, so a party can tell any lie they want. \u201cI do see this as a very grave threat to our democratic process. What is incredible is this hasn\u2019t been considered at any point. If you look at the asset value of Sky, you suddenly go, \u2018Well, hang on there, here\u2019s a bit of unbelievable value but it hasn\u2019t been included in the price\u2019.\u201d The letter says there is an \u201curgent need\u201d for the Information Commissioner to confirm data cannot be \u201cmisused or misapplied\u201d before a Sky decision is made. It comes as the use of personal data by political parties has come under increasing scrutiny. The FBI and Senate intelligence committee are investigating if this data was used by the Russian government to target US voters. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office here launched an investigation into the micro-targeting of individual voters with personalised messages after a series of articles in the Observer. The company at the heart of both US and UK investigations \u2013 Cambridge Analytica \u2013 is owned by a hedgefund billionaire and Trump donor, Robert Mercer. He is a close associate of Murdoch and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s US office was previously located in Murdoch\u2019s Newscorp building. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport told Puttnam it was awaiting the IC\u2019s report into political use of data, though it is not due to be delivered until the autumn \u2013 after a Sky decision is made. David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design at The New School in New York, who is involved in legal efforts to uncover how companies use individuals\u2019 data for political purposes, said that the deal would see the UK take a big step towards \u201cthe American business model of total deregulation and total consolidation. This huge infrastructure has grown up where you can micro-target ads based on this hugely detailed knowledge about households, and it\u2019s absolutely out of control when it\u2019s applied to political messages. People don\u2019t appreciate how their entire consumer profile is attached to their household identity. \u201cThere is no privacy. These companies know exactly who we are. What we\u2019ve seen in the US with Trump and Cambridge Analytica is how this is used by political players.\u201d Chi Onwurah, the shadow minister for business, innovation and skills and former head of telecoms technology at Ofcom, said that the value and significance of the data in the Fox/Sky deal hadn\u2019t been taken into account in the government\u2019s consideration of the deal. \u201cThe whole of competition law is based on buying services. So what isn\u2019t reflected anywhere in this process is that we exchange our data for services. It\u2019s hugely valuable, but it\u2019s been completely hidden on the balance sheet. It\u2019s a massive fiduciary theft, in a way. It\u2019s not being sold for the value that it has. And the ramifications of that incredibly valuable data being controlled by vested interests has not even been considered.\u201d Phil Westcott, managing director of an AI consultancy firm, Filament, who advises companies on how to handle emerging technology, said that what was most alarming was that a single company would own not just this \u201cincredibly rich dataset\u201d but also \u201call the main information channels into people\u2019s lives\u201d. Although Ofcom bans political advertising on TV, Lord Puttnam said the definition of what is political is a grey area and Westcott points out that at a single stroke Murdoch would gain control of the entire information environment of millions of people. \u201cHe would control people\u2019s access to the internet, TV, digital radio and emails. As an internet service provider, you can speed up or slow down certain websites to control what people see. And if you own all these channels, you\u2019d be able to influence people very subtly. It wouldn\u2019t even necessarily be overtly politically, it could just nudge you in a certain direction by filtering the messaging you receive. And those messages could be completely different from the person next door. What I find most scary about this is how certain news and information could simply be filtered out.\u201d",

And the ramifications of that incredibly valuable data being controlled by vested interests has not even been considered.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Westcott, managing director of an AI consultancy firm, Filament, who advises companies on how to handle emerging technology, said that what was most alarming was that a single company would own not just this \u201cincredibly rich dataset\u201d but also \u201call the main information channels into people\u2019s lives\u201d. Although Ofcom bans political advertising on TV, Lord Puttnam said the definition of what is political is a grey area and Westcott points out that at a single stroke Murdoch would gain control of the entire information environment of millions of people.</p> <p>\u201cHe would control people\u2019s access to the internet, TV, digital radio and emails. As an internet service provider, you can speed up or slow down certain websites to control what people see. And if you own all these channels, you\u2019d be able to influence people very subtly. It wouldn\u2019t even necessarily be overtly politically, it could just nudge you in a certain direction by filtering the messaging you receive. And those messages could be completely different from the person next door. What I find most scary about this is how certain news and information could simply be filtered out.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Dublin is streets ahead of EU rivals as City firms plan for Brexit relocation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In boardrooms across London, bank executives are deciding where to move tens of thousands of jobs in the event of a hard Brexit. Rival European financial centres, including Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, are vying for the business \u2013 but Dublin is emerging as the most popular destination. Hundreds of banks, insurers, fund managers and other major City firms had until Friday to tell the Bank of England how they intend to cope in the event of a hard Brexit. Accountants at EY last week said 59 out of the 222 biggest financial services companies in the UK have made public statements about moving staff from Britain to the EU because of Brexit. Dublin, which is still scarred by Ireland\u2019s financial crisis, is the top destination with 19 firms mentioning a possible move to the Irish capital. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, which already has significant operations in Ireland, flew there last week to meet taoiseach Leo Varadkar and discuss further expansion across the Irish Sea. \u201cBarclays Bank Ireland, which has a banking licence and which we have operated for almost 40 years, provides a natural base and we are engaging with our regulators in discussions to extend its activities,\u201d the bank said. A week earlier, JP Morgan\u2019s chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon was also in Varadkar\u2019s office discussing the American bank\u2019s expansion in Dublin. The bank, which currently employs 500 staff in Ireland, has bought a new office building in Dublin\u2019s docklands area that can accommodate up to 1,000 people. \u201cGiven the momentum of our local businesses, this new building gives us room to grow and some flexibility within the European Union,\u201d Carin Bryans, JP Morgan\u2019s boss in Ireland, has said. Frankfurt appears to be the second most popular destination, with 18 mentions in EY\u2019s research. Luxembourg, with a population of just 110,000, comes third with 11. Paris, which last week promised bankers significant tax cuts as part of a major charm offensive by the new French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, was ranked in fourth place. Banks and other financial services companies are looking to move parts of their business to new continental homes because they are worried Brexit could mean they will lose their \u201cEU passport\u201d, a legal mechanism that permits them to do business in other EU countries from the UK. Xavier Rolet, the boss of the London Stock Exchange, has said that Brexit could lead to as many as 100,000 jobs moving out of London. \u201cThe difference three months on from the triggering of article 50 is that we are seeing major financial brands put their contingency plans into action \u2013 over a quarter of the companies we track have suggested there will be potential changes to their London base as a result of Brexit,\u201d said Omar Ali, EY\u2019s UK financial services leader. \u201cThis process will only accelerate as firms finalise their submissions to the regulators on their Brexit plans.\u201d So what is it that makes Dublin, a city with a population of 1.4 million and a chronic housing shortage, no international schools and a stained history in banking so attractive? Although Frankfurt has already secured the EU bases of Japanese banks Nomura and Daiwa, Dublin appears to be a favourite for many City companies because of its historic links with London and the common language. \u201cDublin already has some of the back-office operations for some large investment banks and an asset management presence; it also has the benefit of being pretty close to London and of being English-speaking,\u201d Ali, who compiled the EY report, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell how many people will actually move. However, it\u2019s clear that EU operations will need to be proper functioning entities and not just letterboxes.\u201d Any boost to the financial services industry will be welcomed in a city still recovering from the banking crisis and property price crash a decade ago. The collapse of the economy went deeper than the UK, with house prices slashed by up to 70% and taxpayers left on the hook for toxic banking debt guaranteed by the state, which in turn was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. However, while the public is still nursing debts and negative equity, the IMF bailout seems a very distant memory in Ireland. The economy is on course to be the fastest growing in the eurozone for the fourth year in a row and there is a housing shortage for a growing population. Depicting the Brexit crisis as \u201ca tennis match between Dublin and Frankfurt trivialises it\u201d, said Kieran Donoghue, head of international financial services at Ireland\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, the semi-state body charged with winning foreign investment. \u201cBrexit is not of the industry\u2019s making. Banks and financial services don\u2019t have a choice but to respond to it and they are reaching out because customers want to know \u2018will you be able to finance my manufacturing plant in Germany in two years\u2019 time?\u2019; \u2018will you be able to provide working capital?\u2019; \u2018will the pensions services be the same?\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want that relationship that they have had for years and years broken because of Brexit.\u201d Donoghue said that he believed that more than a dozen banks would ultimately make a partial move to Dublin from London, relocating or hiring anything from 10 to 500 staff apiece. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful city, with great real estate and an open business climate,\u201d Dimon told existing JP Morgan employees in Dublin at a staff meeting. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about our future growth here.\u201d Last week, US specialist insurer Beazley said it was bulking up its presence, in the city while others considering the move include investment bank Investec and Citigroup, which already has a major operation there. Citi is expected to announce later this month how it will handle Brexit. \u201cIt is not that London is going to decamp en masse to Dublin or anywhere else, the industry is going to move to a more decentralised structure with hubs in several locations,\u201d said Donoghue. Ken Owens, Brexit partner at PwC, said he had between 20 and 30 clients who have said they were going to move to the Irish capital. \u201cA lot of them will start quite small and move 10 to 15 senior managers and slowly expand,\u201d he said. Owens added that clients found the city attractive because \u201cyou don\u2019t have to mess around with tax rulings\u201d, allowing straightforward Brexit calculations. \u201cThe corporate rate is 12.5% and that\u2019s what it stays at; that\u2019s what you pay. Ireland is very transparent, unlike some other countries. The rate is competitive and that\u2019s helping.\u201d Another big issue for firms doing the tour of Europe is employment law in Germany and bonus caps and pay restrictions in the Netherlands, according to Owens. As for Paris: \u201cAs a location? It\u2019s not coming up.\u201d The Irish banking crisis was largely self-inflicted with over-lending by a handful of now-bust domestic banks and light regulation now replaced by \u201can awful lot of prudence and an awful lot of caution\u201d by banks and regulators, Donoghue said. The crash still casts a long shadow. The housing shortage is at crisis levels, with the most recent figures showing there were just 3,500 properties to let in the entire country and just 2,800 properties for sale in Dublin, according to Marian Finnegan, chief economist at estate agent Sherry Fitzgerald. \u201cThis is a market in recovery and, if everyone arrived on one day, it would be a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do have a crisis in the residential sector.\u201d She estimated that there were only \u201ca couple of hundred\u201d high-end new homes available for incoming high-rollers, including some \u20ac5m-plus penthouses at Landsdowne Place, in the shadow of the Aviva rugby stadium. The apartment block is emblematic of Ireland\u2019s ability to move on from its past. It is being built on the site of two hotels in the city\u2019s Ballsbridge area bought in the boom years by a now bankrupt builder for \u20ac400m and sold on by Ulster Bank to Chartered Land and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund for \u20ac170m. In contrast to London, where prices continued to go up and up after the crash, prices in Dublin are still 30-35% off their peak. On the commercial front, the situation is different, with 335,000 square feet under construction, and just 27% pre-let and 11% reserved. Tim Payne, head of people and change at accountancy firm KPMG, said picking another city to move to may be the easy part compared with the \u201ctough sell\u201d of convincing London staff, and their families, to move. Indeed, HSBC is struggling even to convince enough of its staff to make the 120-mile move from London\u2019s Docklands to the bank\u2019s new British headquarters in Birmingham, despite offering rewards of up to \u00a32,500. Meanwhile, fears that Dublin would go down the ranks of European cities because of the lack of schools have been assuaged after Nord Anglia International announced it was opening a school in September 2018 and would offer the international baccalaureate curriculum. It has yet to start enrolling pupils but has already taken more than 400 enquiries. JP Morgan\u2019s Dimon has played down the idea of one location inside the EU benefiting from the fallout of Brexit but he warned that could change as 75% of the activity JP Morgan conducts in the UK was for EU companies. \u201cIf the EU determines over time that it wants to move a lot more jobs out of London into the EU, it can simply dictate that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regulators can dictate it, the politicians can dictate it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The sweep of silver hair, fierce stare and rousing speech by Bolsover MP Dennis Skinner was vintage 1980s strike-era. \u201cI\u2019m as proud of you as I was of the miners,\u201d he told striking British Airways cabin crew demonstrating outside parliament this week. Most were born long after Margaret Thatcher closed down the pits, but the comparison was rapturously welcomed. If this 21st-century action, mainly organised via social media, has had little of the miners\u2019 economic or political impact, it has already, under the radar, become a six-month-long standoff. BA insists the action is not affecting its customers, or its bottom line unduly, even as thousands of its youngest, newest recruits angrily walk out. A two-week strike comes to an end on Sunday; a further fortnight of strikes has been called from Wednesday. It encompasses a significant minority of BA\u2019s cabin crew: the \u201cmixed fleet\u201d, around one-third of the airline\u2019s 16,500 crew, operating both short-haul and long-haul flights. All new recruits join the flexible mixed fleet, set up in 2011 during the last bitter BA industrial dispute, and have poorer terms and conditions than other crew. Around 3,100 have joined Unite and voted to strike, concluding that pay on the \u201cflexible\u201d fleet doesn\u2019t represent a living wage. Pay was the trigger for the dispute: basic salary starts at \u00a312,100, although BA said an independent audit showed full-time crew earned at least \u00a321,000 with add-ons. The union says \u00a316,000-17,000 is a typical figure, and crew at the Westminster rally agree: one, now a customer service manager earning \u00a327,000, says they had worked for five years before promotion \u201cand every P60 says I\u2019ve earned under \u00a320k\u201d. Long-haul stopovers have lost their allure for many, with allowances that do not cover the cost of the cheapest meal in most airport hotels abroad where staff stay \u2013 even before the value of the pound tumbled. \u201cWe take Pot Noodle in our luggage because food costs so much,\u201d says Suzie, a striking crew member. Unite reps say second jobs for supposedly full-time crew are not uncommon. Alex, a purser with three years\u2019 service at BA, moonlights in hospitality on her days off. \u201cThey should be rest days after long flights, acclimatising to UK time. Instead, I work for \u00a310 an hour in central London, serving drinks, on a zero-hours contract. When I joined BA I thought it would be different.\u201d She was recently turned down for a small bank loan. \u201cThey said my payslips don\u2019t show the figures BA tells people we earn.\u201d Allowances, incentives and bonuses over basic pay count for little when applying for a mortgage, crew say. While a pay deal of 7% over three years has been agreed in principle, crew have refused to accept sanctions against those involved in earlier walkouts: the withdrawal of bonuses and travel perks. That has been exacerbated by \u00a3250 rewards dangled before those who now come to work: paid for from bonuses stripped from strikers, as internal emails to staff show. Labour has backed the strikers: an early-day motion tabled by Lisa Nandy MP notes that group chief executive Willie Walsh is paid 533 times the starting basic pay of a mixed fleet crew member. Nandy says: \u201cMPs from all parties have been shocked to hear from young women in particular, struggling on poverty wages at the national carrier, having to take out payday loans to survive. This is not an acceptable face of British business.\u201d She adds: \u201cBA could resolve this simply and easily if it stopped spending time and energy on trying to break the strike and instead spent it on its own staff.\u201d Wet-leasing, or hiring aircraft and crew from elsewhere, has allowed BA to operate 99.5% of its flights during the recent action. Nine Qatar Airways planes, otherwise grounded by sanctions brought by neighbouring countries in the Gulf, have been flying a chunk of BA\u2019s short-haul schedule. The airline refuses to discuss costs, instead focusing on what it says is the most important thing: that every passenger will get to their destination during the strikes. Walsh, who has faced down strikes at numerous airlines, said earlier this year that the strike was having \u201cno impact at all\u201d, although he conceded that BA\u2019s costs might run to a few million pounds. He said there are no shortage of recruits; BA puts the number of job applications at 17,000 this year. Compared to the damage recently caused by one technician accidentally pulling the power in BA\u2019s computer nerve centre, which led to widespread cancellations and headline news, the strike is having relatively little immediate impact. But City analysts have expressed concern about the reputational damage. BA insists that customer service has been unaffected, yet internal emails from managers admit that flights have operated with fewer crew than usual. Some customers who did find themselves on Qatar\u2019s planes have enthused about the apparent upgrade: more comfortable cabins and the return of complimentary refreshments recently axed by BA. For now, there\u2019s little prospect of an immediate resolution to the dispute: no talks are likely, and those who have gone on strike for better pay have been infuriated by BA\u2019s financial recriminations. Among the crew, Alex\u2019s feeling is commonly echoed: \u201cPeople say, why don\u2019t you quit and get a better-paid job? But I love the job. I just want a living wage.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "ITV is closing in on naming Carolyn McCall as its new chief executive after it emerged that the man many considered her main rival is out of the race. McCall, who has been chief executive of easyJet for seven years, is understood to be ITV\u2019s preferred choice to take over from Adam Crozier, who left the company at the end of June. Two sources believe that McCall has finally accepted the role after weeks of negotiations as it emerged that Paul Geddes, the chief of Direct Line and a Channel 4 board member, who was an early favourite, is out of the process. It is thought that the three-person shortlist also included Sebastian James, the chief executive of Dixons Carphone. It is not known if James is still involved in the process but numerous sources believe McCall is poised to be declared the chief of the UK\u2019s biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster. However, it is understood that ITV has been locked in tricky negotiations to persuade McCall to take the role, with her remuneration package thought to be a major sticking point. She has made \u00a330m from easyJet since she joined in July 2010, according to figures for the end of the last financial year. Sources say she has been seeking more than Crozier, who made \u00a327m from his appointment in April 2010 until the end of last year. McCall has about \u00a35m worth of unvested performance share awards, at easyJet\u2019s current share price, that she would have to give up upon resigning and which will have formed part of her negotiations with ITV. It appears that a deal is all but done with the successful candidate understood to have held \u201cchemistry meetings\u201d with members of the board beyond those directly involved in the recruitment process. The ITV chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former creative chief and chairman of the Big Brother maker Endemol, is understood to be keen to announce the new chief executive before the broadcaster\u2019s interim results on 26 July. ITV is facing commercial headwinds including tough advertising conditions set to be highlighted when it reports its interim financial results. If McCall emerges as the new chief executive of ITV, which is 25% bigger than easyJet by market capitalisation at \u00a37bn, she will become Britain\u2019s most powerful female TV executive. She was previously the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, the owner of the Guardian and Observer newspapers, and comes with a strong background in media sales. She came up through the commercial ranks at the Guardian after joining in 1986. Bazalgette, who took over last year from Archie Norman, who is to start as Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new chairman in September, has been keen to appoint a heavyweight executive with strong experience at a listed company. Bazalgette had no experience chairing, or running, a public company.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cRyan Gosling is my favourite actor so I\u2019m going to look like him,\u201d says the Asos chief executive, Nick Beighton. \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of Ryan looking cool so I\u2019d like something to make me look like just like him. There we go, a printed T-shirt, add it to bag and away we go.\u201d Beighton is not waving a magic wand, he\u2019s demonstrating new technology that promises to change the way we shop. Again. From seeing something you like to having a parcel winging its way to your home is now possible within seconds as new technologies reboot retailers\u2019 websites for the smartphone age. Last month Asos, which is aimed at twentysomethings, quietly began testing a feature that allows customers to upload photos snapped from the pages of magazines or from social media to search for a similar outfit. Want to look like Lily James, star of Baby Driver? Take a snap of her pictured in a sequinned gown in this week\u2019s Grazia, feed it into the Asos app and up pop 100 similar styles, starting with a \u00a316.50 Miss Selfridge slip dress. About 10% of its customers have access to the software, which flicks through the 85,000 products in Asos\u2019s digital wardrobe in seconds to find the best match to the look in the picture. Rich Jones, Asos\u2019s head of product and user experience, says the retailer does not yet know whether visual search will change millennials shopping habits: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, that is why we are doing the test to understand what works with them.\u201d A number of other major high street players are experimenting with visual search including John Lewis and the shopping centre operator Hammerson. Both have used FindSimilar, an app developed by the tech company Cortexica that was spun out of Imperial College London in 2009. The app lets shoppers upload a picture to search products on sale at the retailer or more widely across the shopping centre. \u201cOur algorithms are modelled on what the brain does,\u201d says Iain McCready, the Cortexica chief executive, who said its technology mapped 1,500 key points from an image. The app gets better at identifying a type of dress or top shoppers prefer over time, explains McCready \u201cIt can learn what a dog looks like and then gets better at it. Give it 100,000 pictures of dogs and it will get very good at identifying what kind of dog it is.\u201d Shopping centre operators such as Hammerson are fighting back as physical stores are challenged by the rate at which retail sales are transferring to the internet. \u201cOur own research shows that on an average shopping journey customers use a combination of offline and online shopping channels,\u201d explained David Atkins, Hammerson chief executive. \u201cInitiatives such as FindSimilar are designed to further blur the lines between the two.\u201d McCready says the FindSimilar trial at Hammerson\u2019s Brent Cross centre was well received and that it was going to be rolled out to all 20 of Hammerson\u2019s UK centres. Last week John Lewis permanently added the tool to its website after 90% of customers said they found it was useful. And, more importantly, they were buying the items of clothing that it had helped them to find. Voice search is being brought to the masses by Alexa, the digital assistant hiding in Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker. Its new Echo Look goes even further with a voice-controlled selfie camera that enables Alexa to extend her advice to fashion tips \u2013 a development likely to force retailers to offer similar services. McCready can see a world where both visual and voice search will become commonplace, saying Cortexica already has the technology that would enable shoppers to scan the internet for products contained within a video clip. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like your senses,\u201d says McCready of the competing technologies. \u201cWhen you use them all together it becomes very powerful.\u201d What most analysts agree on is that the pace of change in retail is increasing. \u201cWhat you have got to recognise is that there is a massive transformation taking place,\u201d says Tom Adeyoola, the chief executive of Metail, the Cambridge-based startup that has just raised another \u00a310m to fund expansion. For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned \u2013 which is bad for the shopper and the shopkeeper. But Metail\u2019s software means shoppers can create an accurate 3D model \u2013 called \u201cMe Models\u201d \u2013 after inputting their vital statistics, enabling them to \u201ctry on\u201d clothes. Adeyoola predicts clothing will go the same way as music and TV, with shoppers expecting websites to offer a \u201cNetflix-style experience\u201d where they log on to be presented with an edited selection of the things they want to buy: \u201cRetailers need to move away from being retailers and start thinking like a consumer tech business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Want to know where the economy is heading? Then read my lips. The boss of John Lewis has pointed to a return of \u201cthe lipstick effect\u201d \u2013 when a rise in sales of beauty products heralds a consumer squeeze. With disposable income under pressure, shoppers are holding off on buying big ticket household items like sofas, beds and washing machines. But tough times also encourage shoppers to treat themselves, and history has shown that sales of cheap thrills \u2013 from lipstick to takeaway coffee, expensive perfume, skin cream and sparkling wine \u2013 can do well in a downturn. \u201cThe backdrop is very uncertain and it was made worse by the tragic events that happened across British cities over the last few months,\u201d said Paula Nickolds, managing director of the John Lewis department stores chain, referring to the terror attacks in London and Manchester. She said John Lewis\u2019s middle England customers were now feeling \u201cuncertain and worried about what the circumstances will mean for their future financial prosperity\u201d and so are beginning to change their shopping behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s the more considered categories, the arguably deferrable spend, that we\u2019re seeing most affected by the uncertainty in the macro conditions \u2013 so those big ticket categories are currently trading just behind last year,\u201d said Nickolds. However, Nickolds said trading in \u201cspontaneous\u201d categories, was holding up robustly. Beauty product sales are up more than 7% on last year and womenswear is up 4.4%. Sales of lipstick rose 31% in the three months to the end of June against the same period last year with Instagram-friendly brightly coloured summer lip shades especially highly sought after. \u201cPerhaps [it\u2019s] the lipstick effect as we might have called it back in the recession [of 2008],\u201d Nickolds said. The link between make-up and economic times is an old one. When an executive at Est\u00e9e Lauder noted that sales of expensive lipsticks soared in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, he dubbed it the Lipstick Index \u2013 an alternative economic indicator that sees make-up sales rise in a downturn. In the four years from 1929 to 1933, industrial production in the US halved, but sales of cosmetics rose. \u201cIt\u2019s not always lipstick that benefits,\u201d said Toby Clark at Mintel. \u201cIn the last recession premium fragrances did really well. Beauty is just a really good example of an indulgent purchase that is relatively affordable so you can treat yourself without breaking the bank.\u201d He said that when spare cash is tight, people try to save on dull basics, going for budget shampoos, milk from a discount chain or holding on to an ageing bed or washing machine, in order to afford feel-good treats where they believe they get more value for money. In the last downturn home baking goods sold well, even though it can be more expensive to make a cake at home. \u201cIn many ways, home baking is a luxury purchase but you don\u2019t just get cakes\u201d Clark added. \u201cYou get an experience, the satisfaction of making something and family time,. \u201cEven if you spend more than you would on a tray bake from the local supermarket you feel you get more bang for your buck.\u201d People search for better value for money in a host of different ways. They look beyond their regular supermarket chain to budget outlets. They switch from eating out at restaurants to going out only for a coffee and cake or eating a premium ready meal at home and they will trade down from branded goods to own labels. Market research group Kantar recently reported that supermarkets\u2019 own label sales were up 6% year on year in contrast to just a 0.6% rise in branded products. They also try to cut down on waste \u2013 leading to higher sales of frozen food. Holidays abroad are also likely to suffer \u2013 especially since the slumping pound has made European destinations more expensive. But holidays are considered an essential by most families so British resorts \u2013 and especially campsites \u2013 are set to benefit this summer. Staycations boomed and Britons took nearly 3m more camping and caravanning holidays in 2009, the height of the last downturn, than they did in 2008. The sharp change in spending behaviour noted at John Lewis comes amid growing signs of a consumer slowdown. Official data published last month showed British workers\u2019 earnings after inflation have been shrinking at their fastest pace since 2014. Last week credit and debit card provider Visa noted the fastest fall in household spending in almost four years as shoppers reined in on household goods and trips out \u2013 down 3.4% and 1.2% respectively. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that inflation is beginning to affect shopping habits too, with consumers diverting their spending to essentials,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at Visa. Last month sofa retailer DFS issued a surprise profit warning, blaming falling consumer confidence for a slump in the number of visitors to its stores. Online kitchen appliances specialist AO World has also warned of a slowdown.",

    "webTitle": "JP Morgan chief blasts US dysfunction: 'It's almost an embarrassment being American'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JP Morgan just had the most profitable 12 months ever for a US bank \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t enough for Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s boss. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with in this country,\u201d Dimon told journalists after the bank released its latest quarterly results on Friday. The world\u2019s largest bank reported a profit of $7.03bn for the second quarter, 13% higher than last year. It has made $26.5bn over the past 12 months, a record profit for a US bank. But Dimon, who last year turned down Donald Trump\u2019s offer to become treasury secretary, seemed more concerned about low rates of growth in the US and the health of the American body politic. He blamed bad policy for \u201cholding back and hurting the average American\u201d and financial journalists for concentrating on the bank\u2019s trading results when they should be focusing on policy. \u201cWho cares about fixed-income trading in the last two weeks of June? I mean, seriously,\u201d Dimon said after a reporter asked about the health of the bonds markets. \u201cThat is the weather,\u201d he said of changes in the markets. \u201cIt goes up and down, this and that, and that\u2019s 80% of what you guys focus on.\u201d Dimon said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the \u201cbad policies\u201d that are hurting average Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, we would have to get our act together, do what we\u2019re supposed to do to the average American.\u201d Dimon, who also heads the Business Roundtable lobbying group, which has been lobbying for tax reform and more infrastructure spending, set out policy areas he would like to see addressed. \u201cWe need infrastructure reform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need corporate tax reform. We need better skills and education. If we don\u2019t focus on these things, we are hurting average Americans every day. \u201cThe USA has to start to focus on policy which is good for all Americans, and that is regulation, tax, education, we have to get those things done. You guys [journalists] should be writing a lot more about that stuff. That is holding it back and hurting the average American citizen if we don\u2019t do it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Republican issue, it\u2019s not a Democratic issue. Why you guys don\u2019t write about it every day is totally beyond me. \u201cI just got back from Israel, Ireland and France \u2013 three countries that deeply recognise the importance of having a business tax scheme for jobs and wage growth. We don\u2019t have that.\u201d Dimon lamented US failure to build an airport in the last 10 years and the opiate addiction epidemic. The JP Morgan chief has become increasingly outspoken on political issues since the election. In his letter to shareholders, released in April, he took some subtle \u2013 and some not so subtle \u2013 swings at the Trump administration. While Dimon clearly favours cuts to regulation, he argued: \u201cSome regulations quite clearly create a common good (eg clean air and water).\u201d Dimon\u2019s letter was written as Trump began his attempts to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s legacy of environmental protections. Dimon also worried about the impact of \u201cpoorly conceived anti-trade policies\u201d and wrote that it was \u201calarming\u201d that so many talented immigrants were unable to stay in the US. \u201cWe are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here,\u201d he wrote. The bank\u2019s shares dipped slightly after the results were released but are still up close to 33% since the election of Trump. The results came as Citigroup and Wells Fargo also released better than expected quarterly results.",

      "body": "<p>JP Morgan just had the most profitable 12 months ever for a US bank \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t enough for Jamie Dimon, the bank\u2019s boss.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with in this country,\u201d Dimon told journalists after the bank released its latest quarterly results on Friday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/jp-morgan-jobs-uk-brexit-eu\">JP Morgan: we'll only move jobs from UK after Brexit if EU forces us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world\u2019s largest bank reported a profit of $7.03bn for the second quarter, 13% higher than last year. It has made $26.5bn over the past 12 months, a record profit for a US bank.</p> <p>But Dimon, who last year turned down Donald Trump\u2019s offer to become treasury secretary, seemed more concerned about low rates of growth in the US and the health of the American body politic. He blamed bad policy for \u201cholding back and hurting the average American\u201d and financial journalists for concentrating on the bank\u2019s trading results when they should be focusing on policy.</p> <p>\u201cWho cares about fixed-income trading in the last two weeks of June? I mean, seriously,\u201d Dimon said after a reporter asked about the health of the bonds markets.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the weather,\u201d he said of changes in the markets. \u201cIt goes up and down, this and that, and that\u2019s 80% of what you guys focus on.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the \u201cbad policies\u201d that are hurting average Americans.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, we would have to get our act together, do what we\u2019re supposed to do to the average American.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon, who also heads the Business Roundtable lobbying group, which has been lobbying for tax reform and more infrastructure spending, set out policy areas he would like to see addressed.</p> <p>\u201cWe need infrastructure reform,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need corporate tax reform. We need better skills and education. If we don\u2019t focus on these things, we are hurting average Americans every day.</p> <p>\u201cThe USA has to start to focus on policy which is good for all Americans, and that is regulation, tax, education, we have to get those things done. You guys [journalists] should be writing a lot more about that stuff. That is holding it back and hurting the average American citizen if we don\u2019t do it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a Republican issue, it\u2019s not a Democratic issue. Why you guys don\u2019t write about it every day is totally beyond me.</p> <p>\u201cI just got back from Israel, Ireland and France \u2013 three countries that deeply recognise the importance of having a business tax scheme for jobs and wage growth. We don\u2019t have that.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon lamented US failure to build an airport in the last 10 years and the opiate addiction epidemic.</p> <p>The JP Morgan chief has become increasingly outspoken on political issues since the election. In his letter to shareholders, released in April, he took some subtle \u2013 and some not so subtle \u2013 swings at the Trump administration. While Dimon clearly favours cuts to regulation, he argued: \u201cSome regulations quite clearly create a common good (eg clean air and water).\u201d</p> <p>Dimon\u2019s letter was written as Trump began his attempts to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s legacy of environmental protections.</p> <p>Dimon also worried about the impact of \u201cpoorly conceived anti-trade policies\u201d and wrote that it was \u201calarming\u201d that so many talented immigrants were unable to stay in the US. \u201cWe are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s shares dipped slightly after the results were released but are still up close to 33% since the election of Trump.
