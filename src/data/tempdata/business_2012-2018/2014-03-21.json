The deputy development minister Maximos Harakopoulos, a conservative, has said he would rather resign that support the bill expressing fears that it will hurt Greek dairy producers. At least three members of Pasok, the government\u2019s junior partner, have voiced similar concerns. With the government\u2019s parliamentary majority having shrunk to three in the 300-seat House \u2013 and the next \u20ac10. bn aid installment from the EU, ECB and IMF entirely dependent on the vote going through - insiders predicted there would be a lot of hand-wringing and \u201cback-door meetings\u201d aimed at persuading the lawmakers to change their stance. A meeting between Harakopoulos and one of Samaras\u2019 top aides today showed no signs of breakthrough.</p> <p>The sudden set back has put a dent in the euphoria expressed earlier by Samaras as he attended summit talks in Brussels. The Greek prime minister has been on a roll since the government clinched the deal \u2013 after seven months of often tortuous negotiations \u2013 telling Greeks that with the worst now behind them, the debt-stricken country was about to enter a new phase.</p> <p>Leaving the talks Samaras told reporters: \u201cIt is both wrong and worrying for people that the day Greece opens its wings there are such disagreements.\u201d </p> <p>The opposition coincides with another day of intense protests in Athens with teachers being tear gassed by riot police as they stormed the offices of the administrative reform minister overnight. </p> </blockquote> <p><i>And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening.

Associate fellow John Lough writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While a process has started, the impression remains that Western countries are playing catch up and that the strategic initiative still lies with Moscow. To turn this situation around, they need to decide in the short term whether in practice they genuinely intend to back Ukraine\u2019s independence and prevent Russia from dictating the terms of its existence.</p> <p>To do so, they need to assess the likelihood of Ukraine\u2019s political leaders being able to pull together to lead the country out of crisis before they commit to support the process. Unfortunately, it is not a given that Ukraine\u2019s politicians can catch up with society\u2019s expectations to provide the leadership required.</p> <p>Buying time for this purpose requires two immediate actions: firstly, delivering emergency financial resources to resuscitate to the economy and, secondly, creating space for Ukrainians to decide themselves how to govern their country...</p> <p>Western countries need to force Moscow to make choices. This requires creating a new form of deterrence that targets its weaknesses. While Russia has competitive advantage over the West in Ukraine and across much of its periphery through the political, economic and military levers at its disposal, its stagnating economy is still based heavily on commodity exports and highly vulnerable to sustained economic pressure. To achieve traction with Russian decision-makers, the West needs to present a credible threat to inflict severe and lasting damage on the Russian economy.</p> <p>Words matter. So far, the vocabulary of strategic deterrence is absent in discussions of how to manage the current crisis. If Western leaders want to influence Moscow\u2019s behaviour, they need to find a linguistic register that moves beyond \u2018sanctions\u2019 and \u2018possible targeted measures\u2019 to express real strategic intent. The message to Moscow needs to spell out that the West defeated the USSR economically and is ready to adopt short-, medium- and long-term policies to undermine Russia\u2019s economy if it continues to undermine Europe\u2019s security.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full commentary is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org/media/comment/view/198404?dm_i=1TY5,2AQP2,BHZIRG,8BZ4L,1\">The West Needs a New Form of Deterrence that Targets Russia\u2019s Weaknesses </a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-532c7501e4b038e10603c7df\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-21T17:28:00.496Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets close mainly higher despite Ukraine tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors are rightly nervous about the escalating tensions between the west and Russia following the annexation of Crimea, but for today at least markets seem to have taken a \"wait and see\" attitude to the situation.

First of all, the stabilization of the labour market across the major EMU economies (with a solid improvement in Germany); secondly, low inflation and low rates that help households' purchasing power and support the picture for major purchases in the future.</p> <p>That said, low inflation could lead to some unwanted effects in the medium term and it remains a risk for the EMU economy as a whole. Should the current low inflation level affect inflation expectations, consumers might decide to postpone their spending plans and have a negative effects on domestic demand. As such, low inflation might turn to be negative should expectations of falling prices become entrenched. So far, such a scenario remains only a risk but we expect policymakers to continue to keep an eye on it.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-803d6ebb-c857-43e0-805e-ab9466164bf3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395415377405/8f5a60ea-67b3-45cc-b446-56758cc426eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Ukraine together with Fed chair Yellen\u2019s remarks regarding monetary tightening keep us anxious in general but as we head to the end of the week, traders are demonstrating a level of comfort. </p> <p>The Fed\u2019s bank stress tests released overnight were better than expected, showing US banks are actually in much better shape than many had thought. Tougher sanctions by the US warrant some concern as President Obama noted that although these sanctions stand to hurt the Russian economy, these new stricter sanctions could eat away at global growth. Obama also imposed sanctions on Bank Rossiya, which the US government believe to be the personal bank for senior Russian officials \u2013 this led to Russia imposing sanctions on the US too. The escalation here is particularly worrying as rating agencies are now taking action. S&amp;P cut Russia\u2019s rating outlook to negative on Thursday followed by Fitch today. This prompted more than 3% drop for the Moscow stock index and further declines for the Rouble currency. </p> <p>As a result, Russian bonds rose sharply as yields fell \u2013 Putin is currently signing the ratification of Crimea annexation \u2013 adding further fuel the fire in the political standoff between the West and Russia. The US is in a position to exert harsher sanctions but that\u2019s not being replicated by the EU who have more to lose due to the closer trade links and reliance on Russia. So far, the EU\u2019s sanctions have been incremental and perhaps not hard enough to hurt Russia\u2019s growth prospects. That\u2019s likely to be the case for some time with the US and Russia likely to be battling it out with the EU standing on the side of the ring, offering support to the US but ultimately, restrained to cause significant damage to Russia for the time being. </p> <p>For financial markets at the moment, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening intentions appear to be a bigger deal \u2013 Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated the central bank could raise rates as early as April 2015, much earlier than expectations. Her comments shook investors who were resolute with the prospects of low interest rates for an extended period. Yellen however, was right to call for rate increases, if indeed, the US economic fundamentals justify monetary tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-532c2bd3e4b0a7fe76bfddd1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-21T12:14:07.520Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7479b9dd-bcab-4b61-b238-8d19d2e5a293\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395404185330/6db062c8-db0e-4b75-a720-5ae618f16351-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, second right, and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, right, sign a political association agreement at an EU summit.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, second right, and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, right, sign a landmark political association agreement at an EU summit today.

Helena Smith reports from Athens: Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition has its work cut out for it in the days ahead after MPs in both the centre-right New Democracy Party and centre-left Pasok signaled they were not prepared to endorse certain measures in the all\u2013encompassing bill of reforms. A bill extending the shelf life of milk \u2013 part of a package of reforms demanded by lenders to boost competitiveness \u2013 has particularly rankled MPs. The deputy development minister Maximos Harakopoulos, a conservative, has said he would rather resign that support the bill expressing fears that it will hurt Greek dairy producers. At least three members of Pasok, the government\u2019s junior partner, have voiced similar concerns. With the government\u2019s parliamentary majority having shrunk to three in the 300-seat House \u2013 and the next \u20ac10. bn aid installment from the EU, ECB and IMF entirely dependent on the vote going through - insiders predicted there would be a lot of hand-wringing and \u201cback-door meetings\u201d aimed at persuading the lawmakers to change their stance. A meeting between Harakopoulos and one of Samaras\u2019 top aides today showed no signs of breakthrough. The sudden set back has put a dent in the euphoria expressed earlier by Samaras as he attended summit talks in Brussels. The Greek prime minister has been on a roll since the government clinched the deal \u2013 after seven months of often tortuous negotiations \u2013 telling Greeks that with the worst now behind them, the debt-stricken country was about to enter a new phase. Leaving the talks Samaras told reporters: \u201cIt is both wrong and worrying for people that the day Greece opens its wings there are such disagreements.\u201d The opposition coincides with another day of intense protests in Athens with teachers being tear gassed by riot police as they stormed the offices of the administrative reform minister overnight. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again on Monday. Have a good weekend, all. The West needs to find a new form of deterrence as a reaction to the events in Ukraine, according to the Chatham House think tank. Associate fellow John Lough writes: While a process has started, the impression remains that Western countries are playing catch up and that the strategic initiative still lies with Moscow. To turn this situation around, they need to decide in the short term whether in practice they genuinely intend to back Ukraine\u2019s independence and prevent Russia from dictating the terms of its existence. To do so, they need to assess the likelihood of Ukraine\u2019s political leaders being able to pull together to lead the country out of crisis before they commit to support the process. Unfortunately, it is not a given that Ukraine\u2019s politicians can catch up with society\u2019s expectations to provide the leadership required. Buying time for this purpose requires two immediate actions: firstly, delivering emergency financial resources to resuscitate to the economy and, secondly, creating space for Ukrainians to decide themselves how to govern their country... Western countries need to force Moscow to make choices. This requires creating a new form of deterrence that targets its weaknesses. While Russia has competitive advantage over the West in Ukraine and across much of its periphery through the political, economic and military levers at its disposal, its stagnating economy is still based heavily on commodity exports and highly vulnerable to sustained economic pressure. To achieve traction with Russian decision-makers, the West needs to present a credible threat to inflict severe and lasting damage on the Russian economy. Words matter. So far, the vocabulary of strategic deterrence is absent in discussions of how to manage the current crisis. If Western leaders want to influence Moscow\u2019s behaviour, they need to find a linguistic register that moves beyond \u2018sanctions\u2019 and \u2018possible targeted measures\u2019 to express real strategic intent. The message to Moscow needs to spell out that the West defeated the USSR economically and is ready to adopt short-, medium- and long-term policies to undermine Russia\u2019s economy if it continues to undermine Europe\u2019s security. The full commentary is here: The West Needs a New Form of Deterrence that Targets Russia\u2019s Weaknesses Investors are rightly nervous about the escalating tensions between the west and Russia following the annexation of Crimea, but for today at least markets seem to have taken a \"wait and see\" attitude to the situation. Talk of further Chinese stimulus measures to boost the economy provided some support, while Thursday's concerns about comments on US interest rates from new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen seemed short lived. So by the close of play: \u2022 The FTSE 100 added 14.73 points or 0.23% to 6557.17 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.5% to 9342.94 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.17% higher at 4335.28 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB edged 0.58% lower to 20,972 \u2022 Spain's Ibex dipped 0.27% to 10,053 Russia's markets recovered much of their early falls, with Micex ending 1% lower and the dollar denominated RTS index down 1.27%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 40 points or 0.,25% higher while at one point today the S&amp;P 500 hit a new peak. There has been much talk about whether the European Central Bank would use quantitative easing, and governing council member Klaas Knot made it clear today that this would only be a last resort. In an interview with Handelsblatt, as reported by Reuters, he said there were other measures which could be used first, even if there was a major deflationary spiral. Twelve people have been added to the European Union sanctions list following the Kremlin's seizure of Crimea. They will have their assets in the EU seized and will be banned from travelling to the union. They include Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and two aides to President Vladimir Putin, Vladislav Surkov and Sergey Glazyev. The full list is here. Standard &amp; Poor's has reaffirmed its B- rating on Greece with a sable outlook. The rating is still seven notches below what is considered to be investment grade, but the agency said it believed the Greek economy was gradually rebalancing and it would grow over the next three years. Commenting on the confidence figures, Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: EMU consumer confidence has now reached a new relative high since late 2007, surpassing the relative peak registered in 2011. Rising consumer confidence is welcome news as the EMU recovery is gaining steam only at a very modest pace and - at the current juncture - improving domestic demand is crucial for a more sustainable progress in activity. In our view, today's outcome is mainly due to a combination of factors. First of all, the stabilization of the labour market across the major EMU economies (with a solid improvement in Germany); secondly, low inflation and low rates that help households' purchasing power and support the picture for major purchases in the future. That said, low inflation could lead to some unwanted effects in the medium term and it remains a risk for the EMU economy as a whole. Should the current low inflation level affect inflation expectations, consumers might decide to postpone their spending plans and have a negative effects on domestic demand. As such, low inflation might turn to be negative should expectations of falling prices become entrenched. So far, such a scenario remains only a risk but we expect policymakers to continue to keep an eye on it. Away from Russia for the moment, and eurozone consumer confidence improved by more than expected in March. Figures from the European Commission showed that the sentiment index jumped to -9.3 points, up from February's figure of -12.7 and better than the forecast -12.4. In the European Union as a whole sentiment improved from -9.3 points in February to -6.7. With this, I am handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your comments and have a good weekend. JK Is Barack Obama swapping his (modified) BlackBerry for a Samsung? The BlackBerry has suffered another blow as the White House is testing smartphones from Samsung and LG, the Wall Street Journal reported. \"We can confirm that the White House Communications Agency, consistent with the rest of the Department of Defense, is piloting and using a variety of mobile devices,\" a Defense Department spokesman told the paper. A BlackBerry spokeswoman said: For more than a decade, BlackBerry has been securing the U.S. government's mobile communications and only BlackBerry is designed to meet the high-security needs of U.S. and allied government agencies. In the meantime, the Russian foreign ministry hit back at US sanctions, saying in a statement: We... will be tough in our response. Washington should be under no illusions. The effectiveness of the sanctions in terms of American interests is zero. But the harm to US-Russian relations due to these irresponsible actions is inevitable. David Cameron warned the Kremlin that Russia would face \u201cfar reaching consequences in a broad range of economic areas\u201d if it sent troops into eastern Ukraine after the \u201cKalashnikov\u201d referendum in Crimea. Since we last met a sham and illegal referendum has taken place at the barrel of a Kalshnikov and Russia has sought to annex Crimea. This is a flagrant breach of international law and something we will not recognise. The best rebuke to Russia is a strong and successful Ukraine. When asked whether Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich or other Russian tycoons should face sanctions, the British prime minister said: We certainly haven\u2019t ruled anyone out from this approach. You need to target people who have a direct relationship with the action that\u2019s been taken. He also said Russia was more dependent on Europe than vice versa. We should also remember that of course Europe is 25% or so reliant on Russian gas but if you look at Gazprom\u2019s revenues something like 50% of them come from Europe... So Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia. Wall Street has opened higher. The Dow Jones rose some 30 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 added over 4 points or 0.2% in the first minute of trading. The FTSE 100 in London is 13.82 points ahead, the Dax in Frankfurt is up 17.37 points and the CAC in Paris has edged 4.28 points higher. In Russia, the Micex is about 1% off while the dollar-denominated RTS has lost 1.4%. The rouble is down 0.4%. David Cameron is speaking. He says Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia when it comes go gas. Turning back to financial markets, Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said: Equity markets in Europe adopt a calm mood Friday, helped by gains in Asian markets overnight. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Ukraine together with Fed chair Yellen\u2019s remarks regarding monetary tightening keep us anxious in general but as we head to the end of the week, traders are demonstrating a level of comfort. The Fed\u2019s bank stress tests released overnight were better than expected, showing US banks are actually in much better shape than many had thought. Tougher sanctions by the US warrant some concern as President Obama noted that although these sanctions stand to hurt the Russian economy, these new stricter sanctions could eat away at global growth. Obama also imposed sanctions on Bank Rossiya, which the US government believe to be the personal bank for senior Russian officials \u2013 this led to Russia imposing sanctions on the US too. The escalation here is particularly worrying as rating agencies are now taking action. S&amp;P cut Russia\u2019s rating outlook to negative on Thursday followed by Fitch today. This prompted more than 3% drop for the Moscow stock index and further declines for the Rouble currency. As a result, Russian bonds rose sharply as yields fell \u2013 Putin is currently signing the ratification of Crimea annexation \u2013 adding further fuel the fire in the political standoff between the West and Russia. The US is in a position to exert harsher sanctions but that\u2019s not being replicated by the EU who have more to lose due to the closer trade links and reliance on Russia. So far, the EU\u2019s sanctions have been incremental and perhaps not hard enough to hurt Russia\u2019s growth prospects. That\u2019s likely to be the case for some time with the US and Russia likely to be battling it out with the EU standing on the side of the ring, offering support to the US but ultimately, restrained to cause significant damage to Russia for the time being. For financial markets at the moment, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening intentions appear to be a bigger deal \u2013 Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated the central bank could raise rates as early as April 2015, much earlier than expectations. Her comments shook investors who were resolute with the prospects of low interest rates for an extended period. Yellen however, was right to call for rate increases, if indeed, the US economic fundamentals justify monetary tightening. At an EU summit, there\u2019s been discussion of stepping up efforts to reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian gas and oil. The EU has made some progress on improving its energy security after gas crises in 2006 and 2009 when rows over unpaid gas bills between Kiev and Moscow led to the disruption of supplies to western Europe. But Russia still provides about a third of the EU\u2019s oil and gas \u2013 and some 40% of the gas is shipped through Ukraine. European leaders are expected to call on the European Commission to draw up detailed proposals by June on how to diversify away from Russia. Europe has increased the share of renewable energy to around 15% and improved infrastructure. European markets have shrugged off the escalating Ukraine crisis ahead of the Wall Street open. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index is trading some 24 points higher at 6567.04, a 0.37% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is nearly 50 points ahead, or 0.5%, at 9344.28, while France\u2019s CAC has added over 15 points, or 0.37%, to 4343.96. Russian stock markets have been hit after the US slapped fresh sanctions on Russian officials and Bank Rossiya, which has close links to Kremlin figures. The Micex and the dollar-denominated RTS index have recouped some of their earlier losses and are now down more than 2%. The rouble fell half a percent and Russia\u2019s debt insurance costs rose slightly. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets said: The European warm up session has seen equities move higher, with the FTSE largely ignoring a slight miss from Public sector net borrowing, as well as another bad day for Russia\u2019s benchmark index after increased sanctions from both the US and EU. For now the effects seem to be limited to stocks with specific Russian exposure, allowing the rest of the index to push on with the overall market move. Footage has emerged from an attack on Ukraine\u2019s state TV channel\u2019s chief by a group of men attempting to force him to resign. Over in China, business confidence dipped in the first quarter from a year ago, a central bank survey showed today, another sign that the Chinese economy is losing steam. The People\u2019s Bank of China said the index measuring confidence among entrepreneurs dropped by 1 percentage point to 67%. The survey also showed that a growing number of Chinese banks are feeling the drag from the economic slowdown. Former Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen says the central bank needs to abandon a culture of cosy chats and has been too trusting of banks. The Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney unveiled a major shake-up at the top earlier this week, following criticism that the central bank had been too slow to spot signs of financial misconduct. Posen, who served on the monetary policy committee from 2009 until 2012, said the Bank\u2019s staff had too much confidence that banks would regulate themselves and root out bad behaviour amongst their traders. Posen told the BBC in a radio interview: What is really most important is to see the Bank of England get away from being so trusting of the banks. That was the culture for a long time. It was not corrupt, it was just badly mistaken. The Bank suspended an official earlier this month as part of an investigation into whether it had turned a blind eye to the alleged rigging of exchange rates. Here\u2019s some reaction to the escalating standoff between Russia and the west. The EU has signed a landmark association agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk, EU leaders Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso and the heads of the EU\u2019s 28 nations signed the core chapters of the Association Agreement on the sidelines of an EU summit in Brussels. The deal commits the EU and Ukraine \u2013 with a population of 46 million \u2013 to closer political and economic cooperation, although the more important parts of the agreement relating to free trade will only be signed off after Ukraine has held new presidential elections in May. In the meantime, Russia\u2019s upper parliamentary chamber has approved a treaty signed by Putin to annex Crimea. The war of words continues. Russia\u2019s prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine owes Russia $16bn. He claimed Ukraine owes Russia $11bn because the treaty under which Russia provides Ukraine with cheap gas in return for the Sevastopol naval base was \u201csubject to denunciation\u201d. On top of that, Ukraine owes Russia $3bn for a recent loan and another $2bn to Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled gas giant. The UK public finance figures are out. They show the government\u2019s financial position improved last month. The deficit was \u00a39.3bn, according to the Office for National Statistics, taking cumulative borrowing for the financial year so far to 99.3bn \u2013 4.3% lower than at this stage last year. With just one month left to go, this puts the chancellor on course to meet his new full-year borrowing forecast of \u00a3108bn \u2013 or 6.6% of GDP. Departmental spending rose more than 7% in the 11 months to February, driven by new data on spending from the Department of Health. But there was also a big rise in \u201cother receipts\u201d. Public sector net debt amounted to \u00a31.2tn in February, equivalent to 74.7% of GDP. Reuters has published a list of European companies with Russian exposure. In the FTSE 100, it lists Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling (with 32% exposure), British American Tobacco, catering company Compass and packaging group Rexam. Swedish telecom operator Tele2, Finnish tyre maker Nokian Renkaat and Danish brewer Carlsberg feature among the European blue-chips with the biggest exposure to Russia. Below is the full list of European blue-chips with the biggest exposure to Russia, in terms of percentage of overall revenues, according to data from index provider MSCI.

Germany\u2019s main trade body warned of disastrous consequences for the country\u2019s 6,200 companies that do business with Russia. Anton B\u00f6rner, head of the BGA exporters\u2019 body, told regional newspaper Dortmunder Ruhr Nachrichten: About 6,200 German companies are engaged in Russia, some of them very strongly. For them, economic sanctions would be a real catastrophe. B\u00f6rner said energy prices would rise if the crisis continues, but thought that Moscow was unlikely to cut off its energy supply completely to Germany. Germany relies on Russia for more than 30% of its oil and gas. Germany\u2019s \u201cwise men\u201d council of economic advisers said yesterday the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to global growth, and Germany in particular. US senator John McCain is among US politicians blacklisted by Russia. He tweeted: Headlines flashing on Reuters, quoting Russia\u2019s state-run RIA news agency: Putin says Russia should refrain from retaliating against US sanctions \u2013 for now. He also intends to open an account with the sanctions-hit Bank Rossiya. At the same time, Russian deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev said he saw no big immediate impact from western sanctions on Russia\u2019s financial sector and argued that the country\u2019s creditworthiness had not worsened \u2013 hitting back after ratings agencies Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s announced that they were changing the credit outlook on Russia to negative from stable. Both rate the country BBB. Moiseev said this morning: For now, I see no severe consequences for the financial sector. Russia has threatened a \u201cmirror response\u201d to the west\u2019s sanctions over the Crimea crisis. Russia\u2019s state-run RIA news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin as saying: There is such a thing as \u2018reciprocity\u2019 in English and in Russian it is a \u2018mirror response\u2019. It should be comparable, and I will not deny that we are thinking about it. Another Russian bank, SMP, whose main shareholders were hit by US sanctions, said Visa and MasterCard had stopped providing payment services. Washington imposed new sanctions last night against 20 Russians for their involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, who bagged large contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics. They are co-owners of SMB Bank. The Russian foreign ministry has angrily responded to the extension of international sanctions imposed on Russian officials and businessmen over the Crimea crisis. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the sanctions were \u201cabsolutely unlawful\u201d and would create artificial barriers with the west. The comments came as he gave a speech in the upper house of parliament in which he urged the chamber to approve a treaty signed by Putin to make Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region part of Russia. European stock markets are slightly higher. The FTSE 100 index is up some 5 points at 6548.29 while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 20 points, up 0.2% at 9316.15, and France\u2019s CAC is nearly 8 points ahead at 4335.7, also a 0.2% gain. The US Federal Reserve was the bearer of good news last night, saying nearly all major US banks can survive a market crash \u2013 29 out of 30. All of the big banks with the exception of Zions Bancorp stayed above the 5% requirement for top-tier capital in the latest round of stress tests. \u201cThe only results that are more nerve racking than stress test results for bankers are their bonus results,\u201d said Dan Ryan, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s financial services advisory practice. Read the full story here. The US treasury statement on sanctions contains an interesting nugget: Putin himself profits from the world\u2019s fourth biggest oil trading company, Gunvor. Among the people the United States sanctioned on Thursday as part of its drive to put pressure on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine was businessman Gennady Timchenko, a long-time acquaintance of Putin and, until this week, co-owner of Geneva-based Gunvor, which trades nearly 3% of the world\u2019s oil. The statement said: Timchenko activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin. Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds. Gunvor said the statement was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cblatantly false.\u201d You can read more here. The sanctions are starting to bite. Russia\u2019s Bank Rossiya \u2013 targeted by US government sanctions \u2013 said this morning that Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing services for payment transactions for its clients \u2013 without notifying the bank. Bank Rossiya is known for its close ties to top Kremlin figures and is to be \u201cfrozen out of the dollar,\u201d US officials said yesterday. The second day of the EU summit gets underway this morning, but discussions will focus on climate and energy (after a ceremony to sign the political provisions of the EU\u2019s Association Agreement with Ukraine). Last night leaders agreed to further restrictions against Russia, adding another 12 names to the list of 21 individuals subject to visa ban and asset freezes agreed earlier this week, as well as cancelling the next EU-Russia Summit and agreeing to sign new integration treaties with Moldova and Georgia before the end of June. With markets closed in Japan for the Spring Equinox national holiday, and no data due from the US, the economic focus today will be on Europe. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe have done a helpful preview of today\u2019s numbers. From the euro area we will have a couple of top-tier releases, not least with the flash estimate of euro area consumer confidence for March due this afternoon. Having taken a modest step back in February, the headline index is expected to increase by around 0.4pt on the month to -12.3, to leave the average for the quarter as a whole up more than 2pts compared with Q4 and close to the long-run average, therefore pointing to ongoing recovery in private consumption in the current quarter. Meanwhile, the latest balance of payments data are expected to show that the current account surplus remained near its historical high at the start of 2014. Meanwhile, in the UK, the end of the week brings the latest public finance figures, which are expected to show that public sector net borrowing increased by \u00a38bn in February, taking the cumulative borrowing in the year to date to a little less than \u00a399bn, and therefore unsurprisingly consistent with the OBR\u2019s estimate earlier in the week that the government will likely succeed in reducing its borrowing for the current fiscal year as a whole by around \u00a37bn to \u00a3107.8bn. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Markets took the news that US interest rates could rises sooner than expected in their stride yesterday. New Fed chief Janet Yellen caught markets on the hop when she indicated that the first hike could come as early as March 2015. But better than expected US economic data ensured shares around the world bounced back and recouped all their losses yesterday. Today all eyes are back on Russia. Russia\u2019s Micex stock market is down 3.5% this morning while the dollar-denominated RTS index lost 4.3% in early trading. Barack Obama turned up the heat on Vladimir Putin last night by blacklisting the Russian president\u2019s chief of staff and key business associates, and freezing the assets of a Kremlin-linked bank. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says we are set for a flat to slightly higher European open as we head into the weekend. The only data of note is the latest UK public finances figures for February. The deficit is expected to return to the tune of \u00a38bn. Over in the US, a series of speeches by Fed policymakers later today could shed more light on where policy is headed. Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher due to speak in London later this evening, followed soon after in Washington by dissenter Minneapolis Fed President Naryan Kocherlakota as well as Jeremy Stein, also both voting members of the FOMC. Concerns over China are also likely to keep investors on their toes, as Hewson observes. Sanctions ping pong set to keep markets cautious. Despite the strong finish yesterday markets are likely to remain cautious, despite a slightly more positive week, as Russia and the US embark on tit for tat sanctions, with the EU also set to follow suit as the standoff continues over Crimea, amidst concern over what Russia might do next. Even allowing for a potential normalisation here, which seems unlikely, concerns remain about what is going on in China which is being reflected in the decline of the copper price, as well as the yuan with both continuing to come under pressure as markets fret about a series of minor loan defaults, from a variety of smallish Chinese companies. The wider concern revolves around the property and real estate market with some concern that further defaults could trigger a \u201cripple out effect\u201d as nervous investors pull funds from vulnerable sectors. This concern has had a notable effect on the FTSE100 which has struggled for gains all week, unlike its European peers who have had a much more positive week thus far.",

    "webTitle": "Regulators may launch investigation into big six energy companies next week", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big six gas and electricity suppliers are steeling themselves for a full competition inquiry beginning next week, against a background of accusations that the companies have used their market dominance to ramp up prices and make excessive profits. The financial, energy and consumer regulators have spent the last three months reviewing the workings of the market and are expected to publish a final report on Thursday. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been working on the government-commissioned report with industry watchdog Ofgem and the Office of Fair Trading, will provide the latest detailed information on market share, relationships with customers and profit levels in different parts of the business. The report is intended to be a first annual study but is weighted with particular significance and could recommend no change, specific reforms or a fuller investigation by the CMA \u2013 which was created by the coalition to replace the Competition Commission as the lead competition body. Westminster insiders said there was intense pressure from the government on the regulators for a full competition inquiry, which could take 18 months to complete. \"Ministers would love the whole public and political row over power prices to be kicked into the long grass until after the next general election,\" said one source. A senior industry insider told the Guardian: \"We do not know for sure what the report will say but it is fair to say we expect an inquiry due to the political pressure.\" David Cameron announced the review in October in order to \"get to the bottom of whether this market can be made more competitive.\" As recently as last month, Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, kept up the pressure by writing to Ofgem to highlight the dominance of British Gas in the market. The row over high power prices, which has been simmering for years, took off last autumn when Ed Miliband told the Labour party conference that his government would freeze energy prices for 20 months from 2015 if Labour won the election. The opposition leader said Ofgem would be abolished and the large power companies broken up when the anger against energy companies escalated as household fuel prices were increased by around 10% in November. Soon after Miliband's intervention, Cameron announced his promise of an annual energy competition review, with next week's report representing its debut. Ofgem declined to comment on when the three regulators might publish their report or what it might say, but it has always argued that it remains strictly independent and stands apart from the political process. The regulator knows that it will come under attack if it does not deliver a full inquiry given the unease about accusations of profiteering and rising fuel poverty in Britain. Consumer group Which? has called for a deeper investigation after revealing that there were 5.5m complaints by big six customers last year alone. Even Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON UK, one of the big six, has written to the prime minister, secretary of state and Ofgem to call for a full Competition Commission inquiry. He told MPs that he hoped this would \"depoliticise\" a debate that energy bosses say is destroying investor confidence in the British market. Power companies have repeatedly claimed that their industry is being used as a political football, but critics insist the problems are self-inflicted and point to a series of multimillion pound fines for mis-selling, which have been announced at the same time as news of rising profits. There have also been rows about low tax payments and a failure to hand over excess cash balances. Citizens Advice claimed that gas and electricity prices had risen by up to eight times more than increases in average weekly earnings. The charity projected last November that by January of this year the big six suppliers would have raised their prices by 37% since October 2010. The average annual dual-fuel bill \u2013 for gas and electricity \u2013 is \u00a31,315 per household. In fact prices have fallen slightly as the government has taken steps to lift the cost of various energy efficiency and other \"green\" measures from bills. The chancellor's budget on Wednesday froze planned increases in the carbon floor price that was meant to be used to drive out dirtier fossil fuels in favour of those that emit low levels of or noCO2.",

      "body": "<p>The big six gas and electricity suppliers are steeling themselves for a full competition inquiry beginning next week, against a background of accusations that the companies have used their market dominance to ramp up prices and make excessive profits.</p> <p>The financial, energy and consumer regulators have spent the last three months reviewing the workings of the market and are expected to publish a final report on Thursday.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been working on the government-commissioned report with industry watchdog Ofgem and the Office of Fair Trading, will provide the latest detailed information on market share, relationships with customers and profit levels in different parts of the business. The report is intended to be a first annual study but is weighted with particular significance and could recommend no change, specific reforms or a fuller investigation by the CMA \u2013 which was created by the coalition to replace the Competition Commission as the lead competition body.</p> <p>Westminster insiders said there was intense pressure from the government on the regulators for a full competition inquiry, which could take 18 months to complete. \"Ministers would love the whole public and political row over power prices to be kicked into the long grass until after the next general election,\" said one source.</p> <p>A senior industry insider told the Guardian: \"We do not know for sure what the report will say but it is fair to say we expect an inquiry due to the political pressure.\"</p> <p>David Cameron announced the review in October in order to \"get to the bottom of whether this market can be made more competitive.\" As recently as last month, Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, kept up the pressure by writing to Ofgem to highlight the dominance of British Gas in the market.</p> <p>The row over high power prices, which has been simmering for years, took off last autumn when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband told the Labour party conference that his government would freeze energy prices for 20 months from 2015</a> if Labour won the election. The opposition leader said Ofgem would be abolished and the large power companies broken up when the anger against energy companies escalated as household fuel prices were increased by around 10% in November.</p> <p>Soon after Miliband's intervention, Cameron announced his promise of an annual energy competition review, with next week's report representing its debut.</p> <p>Ofgem declined to comment on when the three regulators might publish their report or what it might say, but it has always argued that it remains strictly independent and stands apart from the political process. The regulator knows that it will come under attack if it does not deliver a full inquiry given the unease about accusations of profiteering and rising fuel poverty in Britain.</p> <p>Consumer group Which? has called for a deeper investigation after revealing that there were 5.5m complaints by big six customers last year alone.</p> <p>Even Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON UK, one of the big six, has written to the prime minister, secretary of state and Ofgem to call for a full Competition Commission inquiry.

Rinehart\u2019s company Hancock Prospecting signed a US$7.2bn (A$7.98bn) funding package for the US$10bn Pilbara mine and railway in Singapore on Thursday. The Roy Hill iron ore mine will be more than 70% debt funded. The move comes more than 60 years after Rinehart\u2019s father, Lang Hancock, discovered the world\u2019s largest iron ore deposit in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara. Roy Hill\u2019s chief executive, Barry Fitzgerald, said the funding package was the biggest of its kind in the world. The funding from an international consortium of 19 banks, including Australia\u2019s big four lenders, is a vote of confidence in the mine despite falling iron ore prices and warnings of oversupply and less demand out of China. The mine is due to start exporting next year and when it ramps up to 55m tonnes a year it will be the world\u2019s fifth-biggest producer behind Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals. Rinehart described the project as a \u201ccrucible of opportunity during a period of global uncertainty\u201d. There are 2,500 people working on building the project, to rise to 3,600 later this year, with 2000 permanent staff to be employed at the operating mine. \u201cIt has already shown it will create new jobs and benefit the greater mining and construction-related industries,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cIt will add to Australia\u2019s exports, and significantly benefit our West Australian and national economy.\u201d The mine will also enable Rinehart to operate a mine in her own right, with her near $20bn in current wealth attributable to her share of profits at the Rio Tinto-operated Hope Downs mine. Some commodity analysts warn the iron ore market is becoming oversupplied, which will make it harder for Roy Hill to be profitable. But senior resources analyst Gavin Wendt, a director of MineLife, disagrees, citing the quality of iron ore Roy Hill will produce. It is located in the same Pilbara region as the world\u2019s iron ore giants BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals. It will also not be wholly dependent on China, counting Japan\u2019s Marubeni and South Korea\u2019s Posco as major shareholders and export credit agencies and banks from those countries will supply much of the funding. Wendt pointed out that Japan and South Korea\u2019s more-developed economies produced a higher quality steel than China and demanded the high-quality product Roy Hill would produce. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been the biggest customers historically for Pilbara iron ore,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s demand for Pilbara-blend high-quality iron ore is also going to probably grow as it cracks down on inefficient high polluters in its steel industry. \u201cIt really is a triumph for her and good on her ...

The objectives of Coal21, set up in 2006, have also been changed to allow it to use funding already collected for advocacy and promoting the use of coal. Its constitution now allows money to be spent on \u201cpromoting the use of coal both within Australia and overseas and promoting the economic and social benefits of the coal industry\u201d. A spokesman for the Minerals Council of Australia said it was \u201caxiomatic\u201d that a healthy coal industry was necessary for more money to be spent on clean coal research. He said no money from the fund was being spent on advocacy and promotion at the moment and it was unrelated to the global campaign by Peabody Energy \u2013 which has been prominent in many Australian news outlets \u2013 to promote fossil fuels as the answer to world \u201cenergy poverty\u201d. The \u201cAdvanced Energy for Life\u201d campaign describes energy poverty as \u201cthe world\u2019s No 1 human and environmental crisis\u201d.
