      "bodyText": "Although he enjoyed his first job in software development when he left university in the late 1970s, Thomas Madar found difficulty in fitting in. Like many people on the autistic spectrum, the now 58-year-old had problems in the working world and was dismissed as a poor communicator. Over the coming years, he went from courses in third-level education to jobs and back again, but sometimes struggled in interviews where, by his own admission, he would not sell himself as someone who was likable and who fitted into teams. When he got his current position as a software tester at Ernst &amp; Young last year, he says his social skills had improved over the years. Also at hand was Specialisterne (Danish for the Specialists), a company which strives to match up people with autism to jobs where characteristics such as attention to detail and a an adherence to structure act as a competitive advantage. Thorkil Sonne was what he describes as a \u201ctraditional career man\u201d before his son Lars was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, leading to questions about what would happen to his child in the future when he and his wife Annette were unable to support him. The answer was very little. By 2004, Sonne had remortgaged his house and set up Specialisterne with the aim of getting people with autism, who are vastly underemployed or unemployed, into jobs where their skills can be taken advantage of, usually in the IT industry where attributes like seamless repetition and attention to detail are cherished. \u201cThe idea that people who formally have a disability can produce and sometimes even outperform non-disabled people in the workspace is quite a disruptive thought for employers,\u201d said Sonne. The organisation \u2013 a trading entity which is owned by a charitable foundation \u2013 has now spread to 13 countries, including Britain, where for the last two years it has placed people on the spectrum in positions in the BBC, the NHS and Lockheed Martin in Glasgow among others. \u201cWe are trying to help people who are employable who have what we consider to be needless hurdles put in their way by employers, not in any kind of malicious way, but by kind of not really thinking about the hurdles that do exist,\u201d said Tom Brundage, director of the UK operation. \u201cMost of the candidates we talk to are living with parents, in many cases ageing parents, and all the ones that come across our radar, are universally keen to work.\u201d According to the National Autistic Society, there are around 700,000 people with autism in the UK. Of these, Brundage sa id 85% \u2013 almost 600,000 \u2013 are unemployed even though many of them are employable. The problems can start at the interview stage for a job, should they even get to that stage. \u201cPeople with autism are very literal for the most part so they get very confused by metaphors and business speak. They will understand things very directly and they will speak very directly and sometimes without us there to facilitate that interview process, it won\u2019t go well even to the point where people on the spectrum are not very good at selling themselves and touting their skills,\u201d he said. Where Specialisterne operates is in between \u2013 linking up their database of candidates with jobs which would fit, typically in software testing and web development. Candidates are accompanied to their interviews so that they can be assisted to display their best side. If they get the position, they are contracted to the employer via Specialisterne. The \u201cautism advantage\u201d to employers can be an attention to detail and the ability to repeat tasks numerous times without losing interest or getting bored, coupled with a loyalty to their employer. \u201cPeople on the spectrum with their attention to detail and their intolerance for errors, they have very good pattern-recognition skills. Those really fit the big data environment right now. We are talking to a number of the banks to provide our specialists for projects to do with fraud detection and anti-money laundering,\u201d said Brundage. \u201cFor people on the spectrum, if they find a place that they like, they won\u2019t move, they tend to stay put.\u201d Toby Hildon, who works in diversity and inclusion for BBC Digital, describes his experiences working with people with autism as positive. Downsides, he said, were only present if staff were not geared towards inclusiveness in general. In Britain, up to 20 people have been placed in positions so far, said Brundage. Worldwide that number is in the \u201cthree figures\u201d according to Sonne. \u201cWhat you see is what you get. There is not really a political agenda. They are very honest. Some [employers] have to get used to that. It is really a relief,\u201d he said. Problems can arise when that honesty is taken in the wrong way, although Brundage maintains that \u201csometimes fresh talk is good\u201d. Typically those who are placed by Specialisterne are male between 20 and 30. Advancement in positions is not necessarily an aim, as sometimes candidates are happy and content in the position that they find themselves in, he said. \u201cI think there is much more optimism now. There are many examples of employment projects or concepts and there are a lot of employers who are willing to talk about their experiences. I think the idea that many people with autism can actually be big assets for a company, that message is spreading very well,\u201d said Sonne. Madar finds his new role in Ernst &amp; Young, where he gets to understand software and tests its performance, technically challenging and satisfying. \u201cI am a very meticulous person and I am ideally suited to software testing,\u201d he said. \u201cI can detect small discrepancies which neurotypical [not on the autistic spectrum] people can\u2019t detect so my work is done slowly but is of very high quality.\u201d That same working environment in which he encountered so many problems over 30 years ago, has now changed, he said. \u201cThere is a greater recognition of the challenges presented by autism especially in the social setting and also my social skills have progressively improved over the years.\u201d Making up the 1% The German software company SAP aims to have 1% of its workforce comprises people with autism within five years - adding up to about 650 people.

      "bodyText": "The Tories think they have two trump cards to play in the election. One is Ed Miliband\u2019s suitability to become prime minister. The other is the economy. They have consistently had a lead in opinion polls on economic competence and David Cameron has sought to exploit it by contrasting the \u201cgood life\u201d he can deliver with the \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d that would follow a Labour win. Opinion polls suggest voters are not as receptive to the Tory message on the economy as the prime minister might have hoped. There is still time, of course, and it could be that the economy will be a sleeper issue that starts to sway undecided voters as polling day draws near. There is, though, a more worrying explanation for the Conservatives, namely that only their hardcore supporters are receptive to the cocktail of dodgy statistics, platitudes and uncosted promises that Cameron has served up. To amend Abraham Lincoln\u2019s famous saying, in a UK general election you don\u2019t need to fool all of the people all of the time, you just need to fool enough of the people for the duration of a six-week campaign. If the polls are right, the Conservatives are struggling to do even that. Not enough voters are buying the idea that Cameron and George Osborne have miraculously transformed the economy from basketcase to world-beater in five years. And there\u2019s a simple reason for that. It\u2019s not true. Let\u2019s start with the coalition\u2019s own record. The natural tendency of an economy is to grow a bit each year. A combination of better equipment and the development of new skills, together with innovation means that in only a handful of years since the second world war has the UK failed to grow. Since 1945, the economy\u2019s average growth rate has been around 2.5% a year. So it is not a miracle that the Conservatives have presided over a growing economy because that\u2019s what economies do. They tend to grow particularly quickly during recoveries from recession, when there is plenty of spare capacity that can be used up and interest rates can be kept low without a risk of inflation. Yet despite the Bank of England keeping interest rates at 0.5% for the duration of the 2010 to 2015 parliament, the recovery has been weak, with growth averaging a bit more than 1.5% a year. Even worse, most of the growth has been the result of a rising population rather than higher productivity. Growth per head has been nugatory, which explains why real incomes have been squeezed. It may also explain why voters are resistant to one of the Conservative party\u2019s favourite soundbites, namely that the \u201clong-term economic plan is working\u201d. An account of how and why the chancellor came up with his long term economic plan is contained in William Keegan\u2019s smashing new book, Mr Osborne\u2019s Economic Experiment, published by Searching Finance. My Observer colleague rightly notes that while it suited the coalition politically to paint the UK in the spring of 2010 as a country akin to Greece, the austerity measures imposed were needlessly harsh and counterproductive. Raising VAT and cutting back on capital spending were both serious blunders, and the result was that within two years, Osborne brought the economy to a standstill. At that point, in 2012, the original long-term economic plan was quietly abandoned and another long-term economic plan took its place. Deficit reduction would no longer be achieved in one parliament but in two. The government\u2019s original good intentions to rebalance growth towards investment, manufacturing and exports were overtaken by the need to get growth of any sort. If that meant ramping up the property market, so be it. The process started with the Bank of England\u2019s funding for lending scheme (FLS), under which commercial banks could get access to cheap funds provided they passed them on to small businesses and those seeking mortgages. The money went almost exclusively to the mortgage market. FLS was followed by help to buy, a Treasury plan that offered subsidised mortgages for those people trying to get on the housing ladder. All the while, the Bank of England was sending out the message that there was little or no risk of interest rates going up. Unsurprisingly, the housing market started to motor and, because demand for housing far exceeded supply, property prices started to bubble up. This was more a short-term than a long-term plan. House prices rose to levels that made them unaffordable even with official interest rates at 0.5%, and the property market lost momentum. In terms of the structure of the economy, the old imbalances remain. Manufacturing and construction output have yet to regain their pre-recession levels, while the service sector has expanded the number of low-pay, low-skill jobs. Britain now has a triple deficit problem - a budget deficit of 5% of national income, a balance of payments deficit of 5.5% of national income and a productivity deficit that means output per hour worked is 30% lower than in rival nations. Osborne rightly arrived in office warning that the UK had become far too dependent on consumer debt, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility noted at the time of the 2015 budget: \u201cStrong growth of residential investment and ongoing growth in house prices and property transactions leave households\u2019 gross debt to income ratio rising back towards its pre-crisis peak\u201d over the coming years. It said that could \u201cpose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term.\u201d Or perhaps sooner. Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is scathing about the handling of the economy since 2010. \u201cAfter five years of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, the UK economy looks like a ticking timebomb waiting to explode after the election.\u201d Edwards gives stick to both sides. In 2008 he described the UK as a Ponzi scheme, but adds: \u201cAt least back then the UK was not alone in reaping the sour fruits of economic mismanagement. The US and the eurozone periphery were all sailing in similarly unstable, leaky boats. But now the UK economy stands alone, up to its eyeballs in macro manure. Eventually the stench will fill the nostrils of the currency markets with the inevitable result \u2013 another sterling crisis.\u201d Two things have become clear as this campaign has progressed. The first is that the Conservatives do not have a long-term plan for the economy. They have a short-term plan for winning the election. There is no strategy for tackling the UK\u2019s endemic low-pay culture, weak productivity or the \u00a3100bn-a-year trade deficit. The second is that the experience of everyday life for so many voters is in stark contrast to the propaganda the Conservatives pump out. Britain is not a richer country than it was five years ago, and its chronic problems remain to be addressed when the next property bubble pops. Plenty of us know that, and we resent being treated as mugs.",

Manufacturing and construction output have yet to regain their pre-recession levels, while the service sector has expanded the number of low-pay, low-skill jobs. </p> <p>Britain now has a triple deficit problem - a budget deficit of 5% of national income, a balance of payments deficit of 5.5% of national income and a productivity deficit that means output per hour worked is 30% lower than in rival nations.</p> <p>Osborne rightly arrived in office warning that the UK had become far too dependent on consumer debt, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility noted at the time of the 2015 budget: \u201cStrong growth of residential investment and ongoing growth in house prices and property transactions leave households\u2019 gross debt to income ratio rising back towards its pre-crisis peak\u201d over the coming years. It said that could \u201cpose risks to the sustainability of the recovery over the medium term.\u201d</p> <p>Or perhaps sooner. Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is scathing about the handling of the economy since 2010. \u201cAfter five years of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, the UK economy looks like a ticking timebomb waiting to explode after the election.\u201d</p> <p> Edwards gives stick to both sides. In 2008 he described the UK as a Ponzi scheme, but adds: \u201cAt least back then the UK was not alone in reaping the sour fruits of economic mismanagement. The US and the eurozone periphery were all sailing in similarly unstable, leaky boats. But now the UK economy stands alone, up to its eyeballs in macro manure. Eventually the stench will fill the nostrils of the currency markets with the inevitable result \u2013 another sterling crisis.\u201d</p> <p> Two things have become clear as this campaign has progressed. The first is that the Conservatives do not have a long-term plan for the economy. They have a short-term plan for winning the election. There is no strategy for tackling the UK\u2019s endemic low-pay culture, weak productivity or the \u00a3100bn-a-year trade deficit. </p> <p>The second is that the experience of everyday life for so many voters is in stark contrast to the propaganda the Conservatives pump out. Britain is not a richer country than it was five years ago, and its chronic problems remain to be addressed when the next property bubble pops. Plenty of us know that, and we resent being treated as mugs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been my impression over the years that in the United Kingdom \u2013 still united at the time of writing \u2013 governments tend to lose elections rather than oppositions winning them. And if ever a government deserved to lose an election, it is this one. Memories of prewar unemployment and the social insensitivity of the Tories were enough to drive Churchill out in 1945. But in 1951, having achieved much in a period when austerity was necessary and not a political stratagem, the Attlee government was tired and it was \u201ctime for a change\u201d. There was not another Labour government until 1964, after what Harold Wilson used to term with relish \u201c13 wasted years\u201d. In fact, those had been the \u201cnever had it so good\u201d years, and a succession of prime ministers \u2013 Churchill, Eden, Macmillan and Douglas-Home \u2013 ensured that it was a long while before the public decided it was indeed time for a change. Wilson\u2019s Labour government lost in 1970 principally because a rogue set of overseas trade figures gave the impression that its economic policies had failed. Sir Edward Heath\u2019s government lost the 1974 election owing to a real failure of policy; and in 1979 a sea of troubles and a winter of discontent led to the Callaghan government losing that election. It was most certainly a case of Labour losing rather than Mrs Thatcher \u2013 not half as popular as Jim Callaghan \u2013 winning. But, my goodness, she then won a series of elections, until her time was up. The poll tax, her increasingly high-handed attitude to colleagues, not least over Europe, and a rebellion of previously loyal colleagues saw her off. Much criticism has been laid at Neil Kinnock\u2019s door over his failure to win in 1992. But what people forget is the clever way in which, by rejecting Thatcher and backing the personable John Major, the Conservatives gained a new lease of life. In my view, the Conservatives would have lost the 1992 election had Thatcher still been leader. Although Tony Blair received the lion\u2019s share of the credit, the 1997 election was really another example of a government being thrown out. I think it was my old friend Kenneth Clarke who said Labour would have won in 1997 if it had been led by a monkey. And notwithstanding the fact that he had \u201csaved the world\u201d, Gordon Brown and his team were unceremoniously thrown out in 2010. Again, it was they who lost rather than the Tories who won. The reason why I think the present lot should be thrown out is not only that their economic strategy has been misconceived and socially damaging, but because they are planning more of the same. When I say \u201cthey\u201d, I am of course referring to the Conservatives, because even the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, having gone along with the austerity programme so far, has decided that enough is enough. Anyone who studies the evidence and is not misled by the shameless coalition propaganda \u2013 \u201cLabour\u2019s mess\u201d etc \u2013 knows that the financial crisis was not caused by Brown, and that the economy was actually on the mend until Cameron and Osborne introduced their austerity programme. Austerity was meant to revive the animal spirits of business, but in fact did the reverse, as Keynesian economists feared. It was as near as you can get to a scientific experiment in economics. The austerity brigade\u2019s confident forecasts turned out to be rubbish, and we had several years of \u201cflatlining\u201d. The eventual recovery was welcome, but not caused by the wholly unnecessary austerity that preceded it. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has been criticised for going on about flatlining, but he was right. In an interesting interview with the New Statesman recently, Balls noted the widespread observation that Osborne \u201cbasically had to give up\u201d his deficit reduction plan halfway through. \u201cThe deficit\u2019s just not come down at all in the last two-and-a-half years. The trouble is he\u2019s learned the wrong lesson, and he thinks now, at the beginning of the next parliament, you should go back to the plan at the beginning of the last one.\u201d But many people who heard Balls on the Today programme last week were appalled by the way he too went on about the deficit. \u201cThere is not a cigarette paper between the parties,\u201d observed one friend of mine. Yet there is: it is just that Labour are so defensive that they manage to antagonise their own supporters. Sometimes I am tempted to think that the obsession with \u201cthe deficit\u201d \u2013 shared, to their shame, by most BBC interviewers \u2014 suits rightwing Conservatives because it is an excuse for bashing the public sector, and suits the shadow chancellor because it is a useful weapon to scare would-be spending ministers. In fact he is planning, sensibly, to borrow for capital investment, and his plans for cuts are a lot less severe than those of Osborne, although they are still cuts, and that worries many of us. It is interesting that a government so obsessed with the perils of borrowing should now be encouraging, via Right to Buy, loans to buy houses. It makes sense to borrow for things like house purchases. The obsession with cutting deficits too fast was well satirised by the comedian Jeremy Hardy recently on The News Quiz. \u201c\u2018So you\u2019ve got a mortgage?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Right. So you should stop feeding your children. Don\u2019t feed your children until you\u2019ve paid it all back to the Woolwich. That\u2019s sensible economics\u2026 let\u2019s not go back to the bad old days of having mortgages and feeding children.\u201d",
