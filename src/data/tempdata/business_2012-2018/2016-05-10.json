      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell oversaw the sale of BHS\u2019s main distribution centre for \u00a315m and then used some of the proceeds to pay off a loan he had taken out when buying the retailer. BHS sold its warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, for \u00a315m last August, with \u00a35m then paid to Retail Acquisitions, Chappell\u2019s consortium, as an inter-company loan. Retail Acquisitions used the funds to pay off a loan it had taken out with Allied Commercial Exporters (ACE) on the day it bought the business for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in March last year. ACE had taken the distribution centre in Atherstone as security for the loan. Although there is nothing illegal suggested about the transactions, they raise questions about why money raised from the sale of BHS assets was diverted to Retail Acquisitions when the retailer was struggling. The sale of the warehouse has been revealed as at least five bids were submitted to buy BHS out of administration, including one proposal from Retail Acquisitions. The retailer collapsed last month, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving its pension scheme with a deficit of up to \u00a3571m. Its administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, set a deadline of 5pm on Tuesday for bids to be submitted for the business. They are looking to make an announcement about a deal in the next few days. The parties understood to have bid for all of BHS or a portion of its 164 stores include Sports Direct, the tycoon Philip Day, who owns Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Peacocks, and B&amp;M. A number of international retailers are also interested. It is not known how Retail Acquisitions plans to fund its bid for BHS. The collapse of BHS has caused controversy because the retailer has been saddled with the pensions deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership, and Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. Two influential committees of MPs and the Insolvency Service have launched investigations into BHS, while the Serious Fraud Office is also examining whether there are grounds to launch a formal investigation. Until now it had not been reported that the BHS warehouse in Atherstone had been sold. Land Registry documents reveal that Aequitas Estates (Midlands) bought the property from BHS on 26 August. One of the directors of Aequitas Estates is Mahmood Ismailjee, who sources close to BHS described as an \u201cold mate\u201d of Chappell\u2019s. The settlement of the loan with ACE is confirmed by documents filed at Companies House on 1 September last year, six days after the property deal. BHS declined to comment. Chappell did not respond.",

The calculation, courtesy of Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, that the world\u2019s 25 best-paid hedge fund managers collected $13bn between them last year puts rewards for Dudley and co in the shade. The top two on the list \u2013 Kenneth Griffin of Citadel and James Simons of Renaissance Technologies \u2013 took home $1.7bn each. To repeat, that was for a single year. The hedgies, no doubt, would argue that nobody has to invest a single dollar with them and that their industry\u2019s traditional fee model \u2013 2% of funds under management, plus 20% of profit over a specified hurdle for returns \u2013 is only sustainable if the end-client is richer at the end of the process. But that plea looks increasingly ridiculous as the sums collected by the hedge fund industry reach such staggering levels. The astonishing fact in the magazine\u2019s tally is that five of the 25 top earners lost money for investors in 2015 in at least one of their funds. The sheer size of the funds meant the rewards for the managers were still enormous. It underlines a point Warren Buffett, a dogged sceptic of hedge funds, made at his Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting last month: \u201cThere\u2019s been far, far, far more money made by people in Wall Street through salesmanship abilities than through investment abilities.\u201d He\u2019s right. The hedge fund industry\u2019s triumph has been to take its product into the investment mainstream while clinging on to a fee model that belongs in the age of bespoke tailoring. The real guilty parties are those investing professionals \u2013 managing other people\u2019s money, obviously \u2013 who have failed to scream foul. Even as the billions have flowed into hedge funds, the pressure on fees \u2013 which are a direct cost to investors \u2013 has been negligible. To those outside the gilded circle, it look likes larceny. Why is the financial industry\u2019s reputation still at rock bottom, and why are electorates around the world in rebellion against inequality? There\u2019s one answer. EasyJet is on the same flight path, just steeper A triumph for Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou? Up to a point, it is. The founder of easyJet, and these days its noisiest shareholder, has been calling for the airline to pay out 50% of its earnings as dividends for ages, most recently in a characteristically angry blast in February. Now easyJet will adopt exactly that policy. But one suspects this was one of the simpler demands for the board to concede. EasyJet had advanced in stages from zero dividend in 2010 to a 40% ratio last year. A move to 50% looks more like a continuation of the same flight path than a hijacking. More to the point, easyJet can afford it. The real achievement in the past half-decade has been the appearance of something approaching stability in earnings. Profits have increased six years in a row, and are predicted to do so again this time despite a weak first half. That kind of predictability, not traditionally associated with airlines, makes dividend promises easier to make and keep. Indeed, once special dividends are included, the \u00a31bn of distributions since 2011 represent almost exactly 50% of earnings in the period. In a sense, then, easyJet is merely promising formally to do what it has already been doing. Back in 2011, the great debate of dividends was pitched very differently. EasyJet stood accused of splurging capital vaingloriously on new aircraft instead of handing out the winnings to shareholders. In the event, the company has been able to do both \u2013 and, actually, the expansion and upgrade of the fleet has been more than justified by continued growth in the budget end of the market. Adding 7% of extra capacity, as easyJet did in the first half, looks about the right pace. Will harmony now break out between the chief executive, Dame Carolyn McCall in the cockpit and Sir Stelios and his family, owners of 34% of the shares, in the passenger seats? Don\u2019t bet on it because the expansion argument can always be revisited. But, in truth, it\u2019s hard to see what substantial points are left to quarrel about \u2013 other than boardroom pay, of course. The game\u2019s bonds, chocolate bonds Hotel Chocolat has a good tale to tell. The chocolate is excellent, the manufacturing is British and, in quirky fashion, the business funded itself for many years with \u201cchocolate bonds\u201d, via which investors took payment in the product. Great stuff. But, blimey, that\u2019s one hell of a valuation for the stock market\u2019s newest arrival. The shares closed their first day of trading at 190p, versus a float price of 148p, giving a market capitalisation of \u00a3214m. That\u2019s for a business where revenues were \u00a382.6m in the last full financial year and top-line earnings (before tax and depreciation) were \u00a38.1m. The current year is going well \u2013 post-tax profits were up \u00a33m at \u00a37m for the six-month period \u2013 but the corporate tagline of \u201caffordable luxury\u201d requires a rewrite.

    "webTitle": "UK trade deficit with EU hits new record", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade deficit with other European Union countries is running at a record high level ahead of the referendum next month, official figures show. The latest healthcheck from the Office for National Statistics on goods coming in and going out of the UK reveal that the gap between exports and imports in the first three months of 2016 widened by \u00a30.7bn to \u00a323.9bn. Trade has become an issue in the referendum campaign, with the leave camp saying that the size of the UK\u2019s deficit will encourage other EU countries to grant Britain continued access to the European single market in the event of a Brexit vote on 23 June. Vote Leave chief executive, Matthew Elliott, said: \u201cThe EU is not working. The eurozone is collapsing, millions of people are unemployed and Europe\u2019s economies are massively underperforming. That means that European countries are buying less from us than ever before as we trade more with the rest of the world. \u201cIf we Vote Leave we will be able to take back control of our trade and do deals with growing economies rather than being shackled to the failing economies of Europe.\u201d Figures from the ONS showed that Europe is gradually becoming a less important destination for UK companies. In 2000, 60% of exports went to other EU countries, but the percentage fell to 58% in 2005, 54% in 2010 and 47% in 2015. Over the same period, imports from the EU remained constant, accounting for 54% in both 2000 and 2015. Europe has tended to be a less crucial market for UK service sector companies, many of whom have close business links with the US. Since 2000, the percentage of services sector exports going to the EU has remained at around 40%. Taking goods and services together, the share of exports going to the EU has fallen from 54% in 2000 to 44% in 2015. The latest ONS figures show that Britain had a \u00a334.7bn deficit in the trade of goods in the first three months of 2016, up by \u00a31.4bn on the final quarter of 2015. The deficit with the EU accounted for more than two thirds of the shortfall, with the deficit with non-EU countries standing at \u00a310.8bn. The widening in the goods deficit was partly offset by a increase of \u00a30.4bn in the UK\u2019s surplus in services to \u00a321.4bn. This left an overall deficit in goods and services of \u00a313.3bn in the first quarter of 2016 \u2013 the largest since January to March 2008, when the economy was poised to descend into its longest and deepest post-war recession. In March alone, the ONS said there was an improvement in the UK\u2019s trade performance of \u00a30.5bn, reducing the deficit to \u00a33.8bn. The shortfall in goods narrowed by \u00a30.2bn to \u00a311.2bn while the surplus in services increased by \u00a30.3bn to \u00a37.4bn. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, described the figures as a \u201ctruly horrible first-quarter trade performance that clearly weighed down on GDP growth and bodes ill for the first quarter current account deficit.\u201d The latest information on the UK\u2019s current account \u2013 which includes income from investment and payments to international bodies in addition to trade in goods and services \u2013 was running at a record 7% of GDP in the final three months of 2015. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe narrowing of the trade deficit in March is not much to celebrate. It remained bigger than its 12-month rolling average for the sixth consecutive month, and did not make up for dreadful deficits in January and February; Q1\u2019s deficit was the biggest for eight years. In additional, the volume of goods exports was 0.1% lower in Q1 than in Q4, compared to a 1.5% increase in imports.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The positive mood which followed Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting on Greece has helped lift European markets, along with some upbeat company results and a strong start on Wall Street. Investors shrugged off renewed concerns about a slowdown in China, with commodity companies recovering from early losses, and Brent crude rising 3.8% to $45.29 as supply issues resurfaced. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 41.84 points or 0.68% higher at 6156.65 Germany\u2019s Dax was up 0.65% at 10,045.44 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4338.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.41% to 17,934.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.32% at 8775.2 In Greece, the Athens market ended up 3.15% at 629.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 189 points or just over 1%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund is reportedly doing a wait and see act after Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: And the yield - or interest rate - on Greek bonds have fallen to their lowest level this year. The 10 year yield is down 66 basis points to 7.47% as investors hold out hope that the country has moved closer to a bailout agreement with its creditors. Greece\u2019s stock market is up by 3.15% at 629.29, helped by the optimism following Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Looks like the Greek government is getting on with things ahead of the new 24 May deadline of the next Eurogroup meeting. The US market has been supported by the latest jobs data. This showed job openings - a sign of confidence in the employment market - rising from 5.61m to 5.76m in March, and is a positive development after Friday\u2019s weaker than expected US non-farm payroll numbers. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Whilst the market enthusiasm for the day\u2019s Greek good news began to wane this afternoon a strong US open helped secure a decent chunk of the morning\u2019s European gains. Continuing to make do with a selection of B-tier data the Dow Jones was nevertheless lifted by Tuesday\u2019s improved Jolts job openings figures, especially following last Friday\u2019s non-farm disappointment. The number hit its best level since the financial crisis at 5.76 million, surpassing both expected 5.55 million and the last month\u2019s upwards-revised 5.61 million. This helped push the Dow to a 160 point rise after the bell, the index crossing the 17850 mark for the first time in a week. The eurozone saw the biggest drop off this Tuesday, the Cac shedding two thirds of its morning growth whilst the Dax lost around half. Yet the indices remain up by 0.5% and 0.6% apiece, that jump crucially leaving the German bourse above the 10000 mark. US markets are sharply higher in early trading, helping give some support to flagging European shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 155 points or 0.8% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% ahead, as higher oil prices boosted energy shares. Optimism about Greece following Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting has also helped sentiment. The FTSE 100 is up 0.6% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.46% and France\u2019s Cac has edged up 0.09%. In Greece, the Athens market is up 2.76%. As for oil, Brent crude is 2.6% better at $44.8 a barrel following supply disruptions in Canada and Nigeria, which have knocked out 2.5m barrels of daily production. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is set to buy * take over the management of its first batch of bad loans from Greek banks in the coming weeks. In an interview with Reuters EBRD director Sabina Dziurman said the move should mean the bank would spend more in Greece this year than the \u20ac320m last year. The EBRD has already invested \u20ac250m in equity stakes in Greece\u2019s four biggest banks. (* corrected to make clear EBRD would not directly buy bad loans but take over the management of them) And more: soaring car sales. Earlier there was a raft of Greek economic data. Industrial production fell 4% in March, compared to a 3% decline in February. There was a 23.8% drop in mining production and a 2.5% fall in manufacturing production. Meanwhile the economy remained in deflation for the 38th month in a row in April, with the consumer price index falling 1.3%. This was slighly higher than the 1.5% decline in March, and the 2.1% fall seen in April last year. Finally the trade deficit shrank by 23.7% in March, making a 6.9% decline for the first quarter. Imports fell 17% to \u20ac3.6bn, while exports dropped 11.4% to \u20ac2.36bn. The main Greek stock index has hit its highest level of the year. The Athex general composite index is up almost 3%, driven by relief that Greece\u2019s next bailout instalment could be signed off at the May 24 eurogroup meeting. Bank shares are among the top risers, as the threat of a default or Grexit eases. Some analysts are optimistic that the gap between Germany and the IMF over debt relief has narrowed (as UBS argued this morning). Other experts, though, fear that the Greek crisis could easily flare up soon. Reuters explains: \u201cThere continues to be disagreement, in the creditors\u2019 camp in particular, about the way forward,\u201d DZ Bank strategist Hendrik Lodde said. \u201cBecause of the diverging opinions...talks are presumably going to drag on even further.\u201d Greek bonds are continuing to rally today, pushing down the interrst rate on the debt to the lowest level this year: Wisely, Alexis Tsipras also urged his cabinet to avoid sounding too upbeat: \u201cGreece is leaving behind six years of recession and darkness. I want to repeat, this is not the right time for celebrations.\u201d Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras just declared yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting a success. Tsipras has told his cabinet that the commitments to debt relief show that his country is not isolated within Europe. He also pledged that the current bailout review will be concluded without the need for extra austerity, on top of what was agreed in August. The PM says: Greece is not alone and isolated. It enjoys the support of political forces and governments which have finally realised that this country and its people have the right to turn a page. This TV shot, though, suggests cabinet ministers are less than euphoric: Greek MPs in Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Radical Left party have told us they are appalled that they will soon be forced to vote through yet more measures before their bailout review can be concluded in two weeks. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The prospect of having to backing to a bevy of indirect taxes - as well as a mechanism that would automatically trigger across-the-board cuts in the event of finances veering off course \u2013 before the next eurogroup on May 24, is being viewed with alarm. \u201cThe price of power is falling hard,\u201d said one MP, who asked that I not mention his name at such a sensitive time. \u201cHow can we, in all honour and honesty, return to our constituencies and face voters? Even with our heads covered a lot of us now don\u2019t want to confront them.\u201d Tsipras\u2019 embattled two-party coalition may have been given a breather but its popularity has been plummeting in the polls. The main opposition New Democracy has seen its ratings surge since the moderate Kyriakos Mitsotakis was elevated to the helm of the party in January with a \u2018Pulse\u2019 poll last month showing the centre right party leading by six points in vote intention if fresh elections were held. Mitsotakis, who has opposed the latest reform package on the basis that it is too tax heavy, lead Tsipras by 7 percentage points on the question of \u2018who is more suitable to be prime minister?\u2019 Tsipras, who got the backing of all 153 MPs in Sunday\u2019s vote, has says that once the heavily frontloaded programme passes parliament, the leftist-led coalition can get on with the real business of ruling. We mentioned earlier that eurozone officials are worried about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. Well, the Wall Street Journal has now produced an excellent chart showing the official forecasts for Greece\u2019s borrowings over the next few decades. It confirms that Greece\u2019s debts (currently 180% of GDP) will remain alarmingly high in 45 years if it fails to meet targets for growth, spending and privatisations. Here\u2019s the full piece: Eurozone Asked to Consider More Concessions on Greece\u2019s Debt People on the streets of Athens don\u2019t share the optimistic mood in the financial markets today. Many Greeks are simply struggling to make ends meet after years of austerity cutbacks and tax rises, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports: In his tiny shop in downtown Athens, Kostis Nakos sits behind a wooden counter hunched over his German calculator. The 71-year-old might have retired had he been able to make ends meets but that is now simply impossible. \u201cAll day I\u2019ve been sitting here doing the maths,\u201d he sighs, surrounded by the undergarments and socks he has sold for the past four decades. \u201cMy income tax has just gone up to 29%, my social security payments have gone up 20%, my pension has been cut by 50 euros; they are taxing coffee, fuel, the internet, tavernas, ferries, everything they can, and then there\u2019s Enfia [the country\u2019s much-loathed property levy]. Now that makes me mad. They said they would take that away!\u201d... Here\u2019s the full piece: Wolfango Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, reckons the new three-pillar approach to Greek debt solution should win the crucial backing of both Germany and the IMF. That\u2019s because it effectively kicks the issue into the long grass until 2018, when the current bailout expires. Wolf explains: The idea is to address debt sustainability in the short term via strategies of debt management (including options such deferred interest rate payments, lock-in interest rates and adjusting the repayment schedule), in the medium term (post program conclusion in 2018 conditional upon the successful implementation of the ESM program) via interest rates, grace periods, and potentially by usage of SMP and ANFA profits, and in the undefined longer term by looking, if necessary, into undefined additional debt measures to ensure Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. This three-segment structure achieves two things. It offers reassurance to the IMF that the question of debt sustainability will be addressed both immediately and then, in a more substantial manner, at the conclusion of the program. At the same time, it delays this painful conversation in Berlin to 2018, a date after the next Bundestag elections in September 2017. This structure should therefore allow the IMF to participate and the Bundestag \u2013 which will decide in a full plenary session \u2013 to greenlight the deal. French finance minister Michel Sapin has issued a statement applauding Greece\u2019s efforts. On the reform programme, Sapin says: The first aim of the French Government is to honor and support the considerable efforts that have been made by the Greek government and this majority. From the point of view of France, the Greeks proved that we could trust them. And on the sustainability of the Greek debt, Spain says that three essential elements are needed: structural reforms to support greater growth and competitiveness, fiscal measures that allow Greece to run a surplus creditors must produce a \u2018vision\u2019 of how Greece\u2019s debt can be sustainable Swiss bank UBS believes yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting yielded several positive developments for Greece. For example: 1) Eurozone ministers endorsed Greece\u2019s latest economic reforms, meaning \u20ac5bn of bailout funds should be handed over soon. 2) A general framework for debt relief has finally been established (starting with some modest short-term moves) In a note to clients, UBS say: This is the first time there is clarity on debt relief as well as a clear signal that Eurozone member states are willing to act on Greek debt. Additionally, the allusion to lower long-term primary surpluses is arguably not only macroeconomically sensible but a way to satisfy the political desideratum of keeping the IMF involved in the Greek bailout. Finally, the above helps the Greek government build its success story via programme compliance, thereby incentivising it to persist on the conciliatory path with its creditors. UBS also point that Greece has several \u2018loose ends\u2019 to tie up, including getting parliamentary approval for the last few prior actions agreed with creditors. Greek government bonds are jumping in value this morning, as traders welcome the eurozone\u2019s commitment to granting Athens some debt relief. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds has hit a six-month low as money pours back into Greek debt. Greek 10-year bonds are now yielding just 7.9%, the lowest since last November: 7% is usually seen as the \u2018danger zone\u2019 where a country cannot borrow on the markets, triggering a bailout. Investors are calculating that the risks of a Greek default have fallen, but haven\u2019t completely disappeared. Shares are rallying in Athens too, sending the main Greek stock index up over 2%. The City is relieved that Germany appears to have softened its opposition to Greek debt relief (see earlier post). Jeremy Cook of World First, the foreign exchange firm, explains: Yesterday saw the greatest opponents of debt relief, Germany, hint that they were open to the possibility of debt relief and an agreement will be sought. It will come as no surprise that the stick that accompanies this carrot is to enact long needed further pension and spending reforms. And we should also remember that full blown debt write-offs are not on the table. Instead, Greece\u2019s creditors could cap interest payments, extend maturities, or grant a delay on repayments. A couple of Greek front pages today: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, partly driven by hopes of a deal between Greece and creditors in two weeks time. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, the German DAX and French CAC have all gained 0.8% this morning. Optimism over Greece is countering some alarmingly weak German and French industrial production figures this morning, which suggested eurozone factories struggled in March. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says the markets look \u201cfairly bubble, even though Athens still has work to do: With the Eurogroup finally holding their first serious discussion about Greek debt relief there was a sense of tentative hope in the air after Monday\u2019s meeting. Now all that has to be done is for the country to outline a post-fiscal target failure contingency plan AND implement some more unpopular reforms in the next fortnight, before the finance ministers meet once against on the 24th May. Easy! Eurozone ministers are desperate to avoid another Greek crisis this summer that might drive Britain into leaving the EU. So argue The Times today: Newsflash from Athens: prime minister Alexis Tsipras will brief cabinet ministers at 1pm local time, or 11am BST. Last night, Tsipras told the Greek president that things are moving in the right direction, with a positive result expected on May 24. Opposition MPs, though, are less impressed. They point out that Greece has to actually implement the unpopular income tax rises and pension reforms that were voted into law on Sunday, and still isn\u2019t getting significant debt relief until 2018. Greek pensions and wages would be cut again if the country is forced to implement the \u2018contingency measures\u2019 agreed with creditors at last night\u2019s meeting in Brussels. Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: The proposal for the automatic mechanism sent by Athens indicated that apart from some welfare spending, no form of expenditure would be protected from automatic reductions. This includes pensions and public sector wages, even though the coalition had repeatedly indicated that it would like to ringfence them. Those contingency measures would only kick in if Greece failed to hit its fiscal targets - something the IMF is particularly worried about. Analysts at Canadian bank RBC have a neat summary of yesterday\u2019s developments in Brussels: As expected yesterday\u2019s Eurogroup did not sign off on the first review of Greece\u2019s third programme but there was progress on the so-called \u2018contingency measures\u2019 that Greece has been asked to legislate for. Ministers agreed that they would allow Greece to legislate a \u2018mechanism\u2019 for additional measures if budget targets are off-track. Technical talks, including with the IMF, on the proposal will now take place before the Eurogroup now meets again on May 24th. Greek debt relief was also discussed with agreement on a road map for considering further debt measures including tasking the euro working group (EWG) with looking at debt sustainability in Greece. The Financial Times has given Germany the credit for helping to break the deadlock between Greece and its creditors, by easing its objections to debt relief talks. They explain: The political space for a deal was opened on Monday by the readiness of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, to explore ways to ease Greek debt repayments. He had, until then, strongly resisted such talks as unnecessary, putting IMF participation in the programme in doubt. That could be a significant change of position for Germany, if a deal is reached by May 24. At the heart of the Greek crisis is the question of whether Athens\u2019 borrowing can ever be tackled, or will spiral further out of control. And documents presented to eurozone ministers yesterday, and seen by Reuters, suggest serious concerns over this issue. Analysts at the European Stability Mechanism have predicted that Greece would manage to run a surplus of 3.5% from 2018 until 2025, dipping to 1.5 % from 2040-2060. Such a chunky surplus sounds challenging. And even if this \u2018main scenario\u2019 is correct, the document shows that Greece\u2019s creditors would need to cut the interest rate on Greek bonds and extend their maturity, to make the burden sustainable. Reuters\u2019 Jan Strupczewski explains: If the main ESM scenario were to prove accurate, the euro zone, Greece\u2019s main lender, could achieve Greek debt sustainability through three actions: the extension of the maximum weighted maturity by 5 years to 37.5 years a re-profiling of the amortization scheme by setting loan repayments as 1 percent of GDP until 2050 and linearly amortized after that a capping of interest charged to Greece at 2 percent, with any interest that would have been payable in excess of the 2 percent being deferred until 2050. The accumulated and capitalized deferred interest would then be repaid in equal instalments. And if the central scenario is too optimistic, of course, deeper debt relief would be needed. In the ESM\u2019s negative scenario, Greece\u2019s debt spirals from 180% of GDP today to almost 260% of GDP by 2060.... More here: Euro zone Greek debt analysis shows serious concerns over its sustainability Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The clock is ticking for Greece again today, after eurozone finance ministers set a deadline of May 24 to reach a deal to unlock \u20ac5bn of bailout cash. Yesterday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting appears to have made some progress, with ministers finally holding their first talks on debt relief. But before that can happen, Greece still needs to prepare a contingency mechanism that would automatically cut public spending if it fails to hit its fiscal targets (as the IMF fears). Athens also needs to push through a few more reforms, including creating a privatisation fund, before the next eurogroup meeting in two weeks time. So there\u2019s still opportunity for more drama. Also coming up today... New German industrial production figures are just being released. They look worse than expected; falling by 1.2% month-on-month, so we\u2019ll keep an eye on that. The latest UK trade figures are due at 9.30am BST, and likely to show that Britain ran our traditional current account deficit in April. The commodity sector is coming under pressure too, with prices of key metals slumping sharply in recent days. And we\u2019re getting financial results from, among others, Swiss bank Credit Suisse and airline easyJet.",

It offers reassurance to the IMF that the question of debt sustainability will be addressed both immediately and then, in a more substantial manner, at the conclusion of the program. At the same time, it delays this painful conversation in Berlin to 2018, a date after the next Bundestag elections in September 2017.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s top 25 hedge fund managers earned $13bn last year \u2013 more than the entire economies of Namibia, the Bahamas or Nicaragua. Kenneth Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel, and James Simons, founder and chairman of Renaissance Technologies, shared the top spot, taking home $1.7bn each \u2013 equivalent to the annual salaries of 112,000 people taking home the US federal minimum wage of $15,080. The earnings of the best-performing hedge fund managers, published by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine on Tuesday, dwarfs the pay of top Wall Street executives who have been under fire for their multimillion-dollar pay deals. The best paid banker last year was JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who collected $27m. The huge pay at the top comes despite a tumultuous year on Wall Street that has led many well-known hedge funds to lose billions of dollars and others to close down. Daniel Loeb, CEO of Third Point, a hedge fund that manages $17.5bn, has described market conditions as a \u201chedge fund killing field\u201d. Despite the challenges, Simons and Griffin managed to increase their earnings by $500m and $400m, respectively, compared with last year. Both men have poured a lot of money into the presidential race, but both backed Republicans who dropped out. Griffin, who is the richest man in Illinois with a $7.5bn fortune according to Forbes, has donated more than $3m into the failed campaigns of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. Griffin, 47, who started from his dorm at Harvard University, was the biggest single donor to Rahm Emanuel\u2019s successful campaign for a second term as mayor of Chicago. He has rarely spoken about his political inclinations, but in 2012 he described himself as a \u201cReagan Republican\u201d and said he thought the rich had \u201cinsufficient influence\u201d on the political process. When Emanuel announced the closure of 50 schools, Griffin said he should have closed 125. Griffin recently spent $500m buying Jackson Pollock\u2019s Number 17A and Willem de Kooning\u2019s Interchanged from the entertainment mogul David Geffen. He has loaned the paintings to the Art Institute of Chicago. Simons, a string theory expert and former cold war codebreaker, has made an estimated $15.5bn from Renaissance Technologies the mathematics-driven \u201cquant\u201d hedge fund he set up 34 years ago. The fund, which is run from the tiny Long Island village of Setauket where Simons owns a huge beachfront compound, has donated $13m to Cruz\u2019s failed campaign. With Cruz out of the race, Renaissance has switched donations to Hillary Clinton, with more than $2m donated so far. Euclidean Capital, Simon\u2019s family office, has donated more than $7m to Clinton. Simons, 78, who retired as CEO of Renaissance in 2009, is the 50th richest person in the world, according to Forbes. His earnings last year were so large that if he were a country it would rate as the world\u2019s 178th most productive nation, according to the World Bank\u2019s GDP rankings. He has donated millions of dollars to maths and science education via the Simons Foundation he set up in 1994. No woman has yet made it into the top 25 of the hedge fund highest-paid list, which has been running for 15 years. Hedge fund managers typically get paid based on a structure known as \u201ctwo and 20\u201d, in which they collect a 2% fee on the assets they manage and earn 20% of the profits they make for investors.",

When Emanuel announced the closure of 50 schools, Griffin said he should have closed 125. </p> <p>Griffin recently spent $500m buying Jackson Pollock\u2019s Number 17A and Willem de Kooning\u2019s Interchanged from the entertainment mogul David Geffen. He has loaned the paintings to the Art Institute of Chicago.</p> <p>Simons, a string theory expert and former cold war codebreaker, has made an estimated $15.5bn from Renaissance Technologies the mathematics-driven \u201cquant\u201d hedge fund he set up 34 years ago. </p> <p>The fund, which is run from the tiny Long Island village of Setauket where Simons owns <a href=\"http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/james-simonss-house/view/google/\">a huge beachfront compound</a>, has donated $13m to Cruz\u2019s failed campaign. With Cruz out of the race, Renaissance has switched donations to Hillary Clinton, with more than $2m donated so far. Euclidean Capital, Simon\u2019s family office, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contrib.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00000019&amp;type=f\">has donated more than $7m to Clinton</a>. </p> <p>Simons, 78, who retired as CEO of Renaissance in 2009, is the 50th richest person in the world, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/james-simons/\">according to Forbes</a>. His earnings last year were so large that if he were a country it would rate as the world\u2019s 178th most productive nation, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf\">according to the World Bank\u2019s GDP rankings</a>. </p> <p>He has donated millions of dollars to maths and science education via the Simons Foundation he set up in 1994. </p> <p>No woman has yet made it into the top 25 of the hedge fund highest-paid list, which has been running for 15 years. Hedge fund managers typically get paid based on a structure known as \u201ctwo and 20\u201d, in which they collect a 2% fee on the assets they manage and earn 20% of the profits they make for investors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s largest steelmaker ThyssenKrupp has cut its profit forecast as record Chinese exports have led to a global glut of steel and pushed prices lower. The German industrial conglomerate lowered its underlying earnings forecast for 2016 to a minimum of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn), from an earlier estimate of \u20ac1.6bn to \u20ac1.9bn. This compares with a \u20ac1.7bn profit last year. In the second quarter to 31 March, the group\u2019s profit fell 20% to \u20ac326m. Like others in the sector, ThyssenKrupp has been hurt by cheap imports from China, which have exacerbated a global oversupply of steel. It said the decline in the price of materials had been \u201csharper and longer-lasting than expected\u201d. The Essen-based company has held talks with India\u2019s Tata Steel about buying its European business, but was put off by the losses of the UK business and its pension liabilities totalling almost \u00a315bn. It is not thought to have submitted a bid for Port Talbot and Tata\u2019s other struggling UK sites in the current bidding process, where the Excalibur Steel management buyout has emerged as the frontrunner. However, ThyssenKrupp and Tata could still combine their continental European steel operations. In light of the steel crisis, the German firm believes that consolidation of the sector in Europe is inevitable and wants to be part of it. ThyssenKrupp and Austria\u2019s Voestalpine are the only two European steelmakers that are profitable. Its shares dropped by 4% in early trading, but later recovered to close 0.5% higher at \u20ac18.46. ThyssenKrupp\u2019s chief executive, Heinrich Hiesinger, said: \u201cThe overall performance of the group continues to be overshadowed by the extremely difficult conditions in the materials markets. While we are now seeing a recovery in material prices, it is coming later than we originally expected and from a lower level and will also be reflected in our figures with a time lag.\u201d The group has cut more than \u20ac700m of costs at its steel arm, with another \u20ac100m savings to come this year. It has avoided redundancies by persuading its 27,600 steelworkers in Germany to agree to a 31-hour week with reduced wages, which has been in place since October. Steel prices slumped to a nine-year low in February but have bounced back since. Last week, ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, talked of a recovery in the market, underpinned by rising steel prices in China and a rebound in the cost of iron ore.",

      "bodyText": "The pound would plunge 20% immediately after a Brexit vote in June, according to a leading economic thinktank. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also forecast that prices will soar and Britain\u2019s growth rate will be 1% lower next year if there is a vote to leave the EU. The thinktank said: \u201cInflation would jump dramatically as sterling depreciates, investment would plummet and consumer spending would be hit by lower real incomes.\u201d The loss to average UK households could be as much as \u00a32,000 over the longer term in the institute\u2019s worst-case scenario, which involves a loss of preferential trade links with the EU and a fall in productivity linked to declines in business investment. \u201cThe longer term impact of leaving the EU could reduce GDP by anything between 1.5% and 3.7% by 2030 depending on the subsequent relationship between the UK and the EU, as well as the rest of the world. \u201cBut in all possible scenarios, our simulation exercises show a substantial loss of export trade.\u201d Under the worst outcome, the fall in demand for UK goods and services leads to an almost 10% decline in wages by 2030 relative to remaining in the EU. NIESR, which is widely seen as Britain\u2019s longest-established independent research institute, also argued it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to cut immigration sharply should the UK leave the EU. However, in a separate report, a group of leading economists took an opposing view to NIESR on trade, arguing that free trade with the rest of the world would flourish should the UK leave the EU. The Economists for Brexit argued that outside the EU, the UK would no longer be tied into the protectionist trade agreement that EU membership amounts to. Growth and productivity would rise, and consumers would benefit from a fall in prices. One of the reports\u2019 authors, Prof Patrick Minford, a former economics adviser to Lady Thatcher and professor of economics at Cardiff University, dismissed George Osborne\u2019s claim that Brexit would damage trade and the UK economy as \u201ca load of complete nonsense\u201d. In a scathing review of the Treasury\u2019s Brexit analysis, he added: \u201cMr Osborne is very proud of it. It\u2019s dishonest and condescending. It treats us like fools and aims to terrify us. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to believe any of the stuff in the Treasury report. It\u2019s completely riddled and raddled with basic problems of economic logic.\u201d Minford said key figures including President Barack Obama and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, were part of the \u201cestablishment view\u201d that remaining in the EU would be better for the UK. He said the view was partly driven by a fear of change. \u201cThere is a tendency to favour the status quo. This is a disruptive change, free trade is disruptive. I think there is a natural bias among government bodies and international bodies to favour the status quo over disruption. Disruption means change and it could mean change to their own positions. It\u2019s what you\u2019d expect.\u201d Minford said the US was opposed to Brexit because \u201cthey like to have their UK dog in the fight\u201d. The chancellor claims the government would lose \u00a336bn in net tax receipts in the event of Brexit, equivalent to 8p on the basic rate of income tax or 7p on VAT. He said each UK household would be poorer to the tune of \u00a34,300 a year. The Treasury also estimated that under a World Trade Organisation model, Britain\u2019s GDP would decline by 7.5%. The Economists for Brexit reject this, arguing that leaving the EU would improve GDP by 4%. The group of eight economists have also calculated that consumers would benefit from an 8% fall in prices. They estimate that over the longer term, the pound would fall in value by about 8%, which they describe as a positive change. A weaker pound makes UK goods cheaper abroad but imports more expensive. Minford conceded that market volatility would likely follow a vote to leave the EU, but said: \u201cThis economy can take it. It has a lot of resilience.\u201d He added that the UK economy would look different following a possible Brexit, with a quickening decline in manufacturing and an even greater reliance on the services sector, which already accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy. \u201cManufacturing has contracted from 30% of GDP in 1970 to 10% or so today. That\u2019s the long-run trend, it\u2019s contracting anyway. Hi-tech manufacturing, which is really like services, will not disappear. \u201cThat is the future of manufacturing in the UK. What\u2019s going on in this model is that the unskilled labour-intensive manufacturing is going to contract. That\u2019s a long-run trend and [Brexit] will hasten it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Capita is leading the market higher after an upbeat trading statement from the outsourcing group. Ahead of its annual meeting it said it had made a solid start to the year and was confident it would grow revenues by at least 4% this year. It has won \u00a34580m worth of contracts, including Volkswagen and Debenhams, although some decisions have been taking longer than expected to come through. The company\u2019s shares have climbed 44p to \u00a310.68, but not everyone was convinced. UBS analysts issued a neutral recommendation and said: With \u00a3458m aggregate contract wins year to date (versus \u00a31,200m this time last year, and \u00a31,800m in 2015 overall) Capita has made a slower start as expected. It notes that some pipeline decisions have been slower than anticipated, but still expects most to convert this year. It sounds like the \u2018transactional\u2019 businesses and client expansion are picking up some of the slack. Peel Hunt remained at hold: Trading year to date is in line and there is no change to expectations for the full year. We continue to believe that Capita is well positioned to capitalise over the medium term on a wide range of both organic and acquisition opportunities. However, organic growth in 2016 is likely to remain relatively muted, with management targeting at least 4% (2015: 4.3%). Stifel was more negative: Capita has published an annual meeting statement and trading update today maintaining its 4% organic growth target and highlighting its confidence in the structural growth opportunities. However, we think that year to date contract wins is on the low side and acquisition spend is also surprisingly light. We do not anticipate making any changes to our forecasts and remain sellers of the stock. But Jefferies issued a buy note, saying: Although the statement contains little new information, 2016 estimated organic revenue growth visibility has improved from 0.7% in February to 2% currently, which is slightly better than anticipated. We believe Capita\u2019s valuation (the bottom of its 15-year range) offers an attractive entry point for a long duration compounder. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 49.03 points at 6163.84, despite the first quarter UK trade gap widening to its biggest since 2008. Optimism over the Greek crisis following Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting is helping sentiment. But with the rising dollar and renewed fears of a slowdown in China hitting commodities - copper is at a four week low and iron ore continues to be under pressure - mining shares are once more among the fallers. Antofagasta is down 5.9p at 410.7p, Glencore is 1.4p lower at 131.15p and Rio Tinto has lost 12.5p to \u00a319.52. Next has fallen 30p to \u00a352.95 after the latest British Retail Consortium figures showed the sharpest drop in sales for eight months in April. But easyJet is up 39p at \u00a315.09 following an update, with British Airways owner International Airlines Group also moving higher, up 7.5p at 521p. Among the mid caps, Restaurant Group has risen 9.2p to 283p, recovering some ground after its recent profit warning, amid vague takeover talk in the wake of its recent share price slump.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the luxury chocolate maker Hotel Chocolat surged by more than a quarter in their first day of trading on the stock market. The company placed shares on Aim on 5 May at 148p each and they jumped 28% to 190p on Tuesday, valuing the company at about \u00a3214m. Hotel Chocolat, founded in 2003 as Choc Express, raised \u00a355.5m from its share sale. Some \u00a343m went to the founders, Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris. The other \u00a312m will be used to add to its 81 shops, improve its website and increase production at its Cambridge factory. Thirlwell and Harris have retained a combined two-thirds stake in the company worth \u00a3140m \u2013 up \u00a330m on the day. Thirlwell, Hotel Chocolat\u2019s chief executive, said investors were enthusiastic because of the company\u2019s upmarket niche and its control over products and brand. \u201cHotel Chocolat is a business that\u2019s been built to last. This isn\u2019t a product that\u2019s going to be listed in supermarkets and then disappear. Our investor roadshow enabled potential investors to see behind the scenes and visit our factory, our web marketing centre and our distribution centre.\u201d Hotel Chocolat portrays itself as a luxury brand, having as much in common with Burberry as with rival chocolate makers, such as Thorntons. It claims to inject hedonism into the experience of eating chocolate and to use \u201cmore cocoa, less sugar\u201d to make premium products. Unlike Thorntons, which fell victim to the grocery price war, Hotel Chocolat has kept its chocolates out of supermarkets to preserve their cachet. The company\u2019s success reflects affluent shoppers\u2019 willingness to pay extra for products perceived to be of high quality, made with premium ingredients. Shares in Fever-Tree, the maker of upmarket drink mixers, have more than quadrupled since 2014 as sales have boomed. The Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cMany consumer markets are polarising between discounters and aspirational brands. Investors are scared of missing out on another Fever-Tree but it remains to be seen how many buyers were just \u2018flippers\u2019 [seeking a quick return]. Remember that day-one success doesn\u2019t guarantee a successful IPO.\u201d As well as its network of shops, Hotel Chocolat owns a cocoa plantation on St Lucia, which is home to a luxury hotel where a two-week stay costs up to \u00a310,000. It also has two UK restaurants, one in London\u2019s Borough Market and the other in Leeds. Thirlwell said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to prove and a lot to do. We\u2019re not getting our heads turned by the warm welcome. In the morning I\u2019m going to our factory to try our recipe ideas to get everything laid down for our Christmas period.\u201d",

The other \u00a312m will be used to add to its 81 shops, improve its website and increase production at its Cambridge factory. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/02/hotel-chocolat-boss-easter-angus-thirlwell-interview\">I should cocoa: Hotel Chocolat boss aims for more bounce than an Easter bunny</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thirlwell and Harris have retained a combined two-thirds stake in the company worth \u00a3140m \u2013 up \u00a330m on the day.</p> <p>Thirlwell, Hotel Chocolat\u2019s chief executive, said investors were enthusiastic because of the company\u2019s upmarket niche and its control over products and brand. </p> <p>\u201cHotel Chocolat is a business that\u2019s been built to last. This isn\u2019t a product that\u2019s going to be listed in supermarkets and then disappear. Our investor roadshow enabled potential investors to see behind the scenes and visit our factory, our web marketing centre and our distribution centre.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hotel Chocolat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/02/hotel-chocolat-boss-easter-angus-thirlwell-interview\">portrays itself as a luxury brand</a>, having as much in common with Burberry as with rival chocolate makers, such as Thorntons. It claims to inject hedonism into the experience of eating chocolate and to use \u201cmore cocoa, less sugar\u201d to make premium products. Unlike Thorntons, which fell victim to the grocery price war, Hotel Chocolat has kept its chocolates out of supermarkets to preserve their cachet.</p> <p>The company\u2019s success reflects affluent shoppers\u2019 willingness to pay extra for products perceived to be of high quality, made with premium ingredients. Shares in Fever-Tree, the maker of upmarket drink mixers, have more than quadrupled since 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/fever-tree-mixers-prove-just-the-tonic-with-77-rise-in-sales\">as sales have boomed</a>.<br></p> <p>The Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cMany consumer markets are polarising between discounters and aspirational brands. Investors are scared of missing out on another Fever-Tree but it remains to be seen how many buyers were just \u2018flippers\u2019 [seeking a quick return]. Remember that day-one success doesn\u2019t guarantee a successful IPO.\u201d<br></p> <p>As well as its network of shops, Hotel Chocolat owns a cocoa plantation on St Lucia, which is home to a luxury hotel where a two-week stay costs up to \u00a310,000. It also has two UK restaurants, one in London\u2019s Borough Market and the other in Leeds.</p> <p>Thirlwell said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to prove and a lot to do. We\u2019re not getting our heads turned by the warm welcome. In the morning I\u2019m going to our factory to try our recipe ideas to get everything laid down for our Christmas period.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet\u2019s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has got his way after the airline pledged to pay out half its annual profit to shareholders, despite falling into the red in the first half of the financial year as the effects of terrorist attacks dented passenger revenues. The budget airline said it took the decision to increase the proportion of earnings from 40% after a thorough review of its financial position. It said it was not a response to pressure from Haji-Ioannou. Haji-Ioannou, who is easyJet\u2019s biggest shareholder, stepped up his criticism of the company in February, accusing it of a scattergun dividend policy that he said depressed its share price. Through his easyGroup holding company, he called for easyJet to pay out half of earnings to shareholders. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSir Stelios has been saying this for six years. It\u2019s not something he has raised recently. We always talk to easyGroup and all our shareholders. It wouldn\u2019t have had an impact on the decision today because it\u2019s something we\u2019ve known about for many years.\u201d Including special dividends, easyJet has paid out just over half of its profit to shareholders since 2011. The announcement makes the policy formal, McCall said. Haji-Ioannou said the commitment to pay out half of profit made things clearer for shareholders but that easyJet\u2019s plan to increase the size of its fleet of 247 planes by 7% to 8% a year was wasteful and that some of the planes would not be profitable. He said: \u201cI think all shareholders like some profitable growth, not unprofitable growth. The company needs to find the right balance on growth rate in the fleet before the profits start going down again like they did in the previous decade. Remember the payout ratio is only a ratio after all.\u201d The budget carrier said it expected to meet market forecasts for the year despite swinging to a \u00a324m pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of March from a \u00a37m profit a year earlier. The company said revenue per seat fell 6.6% after it cut prices following the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels to encourage wary travellers back on to planes. Cancelled flights to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, after a Russian passenger plane was downed by a bomb, and currency movements also affected revenue per seat. This will fall about 7% in the current quarter, which ends in June, though bookings are back in line with a year earlier, the company said. In the period, passenger numbers rose 7.4% on the year to 31 million. McCall said passenger numbers were back to normal but that easyJet would have to keep prices low for a while longer rather than imposing sudden increases. \u201cDemand always comes back. We\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly because prices are 6% less than a year ago. EasyJet\u2019s first-half result was slightly better than analysts\u2019 average forecast for a loss of \u00a325.7m, according to Bloomberg. Analysts expect profit for the year that ends in September to be \u00a3721m, up from \u00a3686m last year. The company\u2019s shares, down about 17% this year, rose almost 3% to \u00a315 in afternoon trading.",
