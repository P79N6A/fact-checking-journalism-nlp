      "bodyText": "The strangest acquisition in the retailing sector in the past couple of years was the \u00a3340m purchase of Homebase by Wesfarmers of Australia. It was odd in many ways. First, nobody had been able to make decent money from Homebase in years. Second, hardly anybody in the UK has heard of Bunnings, the Australian format that will gradually replace Homebase. Third, Wesfarmers had never done a big deal outside Australia and New Zealand. So, after the first full year of ownership, how is the revolution shaping up? Not well. Homebase lost \u00a354m last year and the bullishness of a year ago has gone. \u201cThe volume and pace of repositioning Homebase affected store execution and consequently trading performance,\u201d Wesfarmers says. As for the four new Bunnings stores, \u201cearly indications are that the format is resonating well with customers\u201d. Resonating well? Does that mean financial targets are being met or not? The Homebase refit will take three years at least, so it\u2019s too soon to write off the Aussies, but a loss of \u00a354m in year one won\u2019t reassure the many vocal sceptics back home. A glance at B&amp;Q won\u2019t raise spirits, either. Parent Kingfisher grumbled about summer rain, as it often does, but minus 4.7% for B&amp;Q\u2019s like-for-like sales was a poor result in any weather. The shares fell 4% to hit a two-year low. Kingfisher has become an infuriating investment for its shareholders. It has preached the virtue of being a pan-European retailer for a decade but the benefits constantly seem to lie around the next corner. The latest five-year plan aims eventually to improve annual earnings by \u00a3500m, by rebooting IT systems and halving the number of products, but it\u2019s hard work. There have been too many stock shortages. Disruption is \u201con an improving trend\u201d, says Kingfisher\u2019s chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury, looking for comfort. Bunnings beware: capturing the Anglo-Australian benefits probably won\u2019t be straightforward if Kingfisher is still struggling with pan-European ones. A little more honesty needed over energy price cap Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, is stating the obvious again. You can\u2019t blame him. He is the regulator who has been lined up to find a miraculous way to live up to the Tories\u2019 pre-election hype about cutting \u00a3100 from every household\u2019s energy bill. The task looks impossible. Theresa May championed price caps and then found herself with a slim majority and unable to deliver them. Thus Nolan has found the ball booted into his court. \u201cOfgem has powers available that would allow it to address the problems in the market we now see,\u201d the energy secretary, Greg Clark, said after the election. But what powers does Ofgem \u2013 the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets \u2013 really have? Formally, it can do whatever it wishes because it is an independent regulator. But Ofgem would run into practical difficulties if it opted for a market-wide price cap on standard variable tariffs, which seemed to be May\u2019s idea. The energy suppliers could appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority and, since the CMA last year rejected a full price cap, the protests would probably succeed. Thus Nolan, in an interview with the FT, again felt obliged to point out the facts of life. A wide-ranging intervention in the energy market is a \u201cpolicy matter for government\u201d, he said. He\u2019s right. Ofgem can fiddle with \u201csafeguard\u201d tariffs for specific groups of customers and will probably do so again next month when it responds to Clark. Prepayment customers are already covered and another two or three million people could be included if the net is extended to yet-to-be-defined \u201cvulnerable\u201d customers. But that would only take the tally to six or seven million customers, not the 17 million families referenced by May. Ministers, especially Clark, ought to be more honest. A limited price cap is a job for Ofgem but a full May-style fix is a task for parliament. The blurring of the lines confuses matters, which is presumably the intention. Asda gets a pat on the head from Walmart Lucky old Asda got a visit in June from its big boss \u2013 the Walmart president and chief executive, Doug McMillon \u2013 and now it has received a pat on the head. \u201cThere\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction,\u201d says McMillon. Well, OK, the first quarterly rise in sales for three years is plainly an improvement, but let\u2019s not overstate matters. The figure was only 1.8% and profits still fell. In the circumstances, Walmart\u2019s relaxed keep-up-the-good-work attitude is remarkable. The US giant has bigger things to worry about, like Amazon\u2019s adventures in its own backyard. But, once upon a time, Asda, fuelled by Walmart\u2019s muscle, was supposed to cause chaos among competitors. It never happened, and won\u2019t now.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for the day and the big news came from the European Central Bank minutes and UK retail sales. ECB minutes revealed that the Bank\u2019s policymakers are fretting about the euro \u201covershooting\u201d against other currencies. That\u2019s a concern because a strong euro would make exports from the 19-nation single currency bloc less competitive. The release of the minutes sent the euro on a downward trajectory. In the UK, retail sales were up 0.3% month on month in July, slightly ahead of a forecast of 0.2%, an encouraging sign coming hot on the heels of an apparent easing of the cost of living squeeze. However June\u2019s retail sales figure was revised downwards from 0.6% to 0.3%. Elsewhere, European markets took a turn for the worse after a winning streak and the FTSE was down by mid-afternoon, after lacklustre results from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher and Mecca Bingo owner Rank. On that note, it\u2019s time to put the blog back into hibernation. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back bright and early tomorrow with all the latest developments. Here\u2019s Guardian retail guru Sarah Butler with the full lowdown on Asda\u2019s first sales rise for three years. In a note snappily titled \u201cEurozone: Between taper and tantrum\u201d, analysts at Dutch bank ING have been unpicking those ECB minutes, which have put the euro on the slide. They are looking ahead to next week\u2019s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole and think the minutes reflect cautiousness at the ECB about unwinding monetary stimulus. Today\u2019s minutes fit into the picture of an ECB which wants to steer and moderate the process towards tapering extremely cautiously. Yesterday\u2019s reports that Mario Draghi would possibly not say anything new on the bank\u2019s monetary policy at his speech at the Jackson Hole conference on 25 August had already given the same flavour. However, ING reckon this does not rule out the possibility of more subtle changes of tone at the ECB, most likely further towards the back end of the year. All of this means that in our view the ECB will take another baby step towards tapering at the September meeting. This could be done by putting more emphasis on the strong economic recovery which easily could do with somewhat less monetary stimulus and/or by using the well-known key phrase that the Governing Council has tasked the relevant committees to investigate several options for QE in 2018. Tapering will come but somehow the ECB itself does not yet entirely know when and how to do it. UK retail sales growth may have been pretty lacklustre in July but nobody has told Asda. The British supermarket, part of the world\u2019s largest retailer Wal-Mart, has reported its first underlying sales growth for three years. Like-for-like sales at the UK\u2019s third biggest supermarket rose by 1.8% in its second quarter, helped by food price inflation and a comparison against a weak period last year. That\u2019s still quite the turnaround from the first quarter, when sales were down 2.8%, the eleventh straight quarterly decline. Details of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council meeting for July have been released. It seems policymakers are concerned about the euro \u201covershooting\u201d in the future. In other words they\u2019re worried the euro may strengthen too much. The reason that\u2019s a concern is that the eurozone relies quite heavily on exports and a stronger euro could make those exports less attractive to buyers outside the 19-nation bloc. The euro hit a three-week low against the dollar after the ECB voiced its fears. The Federation of Small Businesses has taken a look at July\u2019s UK retail sales and they are not impressed. Here\u2019s the verdict of Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman. Confidence among small retailers has plummeted over the first half of the year. We\u2019re worryingly close to flat, or even negative, retail sales growth across the UK. \u201cWith operating costs at their highest in four years, small business owners are paying themselves less, struggling to award pay rises and pushing up prices in an attempt to absorb increased outgoings. This threatens to further stifle already reduced consumer spending power. \u201cInflationary pressure, Brexit uncertainty and delays to business rates relief measures are making it almost impossible for small retailers to invest and plan for the future. In this unforgiving climate, the Government needs to carefully consider its inaugural Budget. Stealth tax grabs in the form of hikes to fuel duty and insurance premium tax will make a bad situation worse. A quick check on markets, currencies and commodities as we head towards noon. The FTSE100 is down 25 at 7407 after disappointing numbers from Kingfisher and Rank Germany\u2019s DAX is 12 points lower at 122251, while the French CAC is off 8.6 points at 5168 Sterling is at $1.2858 and \u20ac1.1694 Brent crude oil is flat at $50.24 per barrel The Guardian business desk\u2019s ace new economics correspondent Richard Partington has put some flesh on the bones of those UK retail sales figures. Here\u2019s his version of events. Time for a bit of light relief after those chewy retail sales figures. Harper\u2019s has published a transcript of the jury selection process in the trial of beleaguered pharmaceuticals chief executive Martin Shkreli, who was convicted of fraud earlier this month. It\u2019s fair to say that potential jurors were tough to find, with most already having formed some pretty strong opinions on Shkreli, who has been widely condemned after his company Turing raised the price of drugs for conditions including HIV/AIDS. More than two hundred were excused as a result. It started badly, with prospective Juror No 1 declaring: \u201cI\u2019m aware of the defendant and I hate him.\u201d Another candidate described Shkreli as the \u201cmost hated man in America\u201d while one felt incapable of being impartial because he \u201ckind of looks like a d***\u201d. But perhaps the most heinous accusation levelled at Shkreli by jurors was that he \u201cdisrespected the Wu-Tang Clan\u201d, the influential New York hip-hop group that enjoyed a meteoric rise in the 1990s with their distinctive sound. Shkreli was the man who bought the sole copy of the Wu-Tang\u2019s special release \u201cOnce Upon A Time in Shaolin\u201d for $2m in 2015, on the condition that he didn\u2019t release it for 88 years. Shkreli duly leaked it to celebrate Donald Trump\u2019s election, sparking a war of words with the group\u2019s members including Ghostface Killah, who deemed him a \u201csh*thead\u201d. Of course, any fan of the hip-hop outfit could have told Shkreli that the Wu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing Ta F\u2019 Wit and advised him to Protect Ya Neck, or risk crying Tearz. Price rises in the 19 countries that share the euro currency held firm during July, with inflation sticking at 1.3% excluding energy and unprocessed food, according to the European statistics office Eurostat. Inflation remains below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2% but has ticked up slightly on 1.2% in June and came in above analysts\u2019 forecasts of 1.2%. We may get an indication later today of whether the ECB is moving towards an unwinding of its monetary stimulus programme, with the Bank\u2019s Governing Council meeting minutes from July due to be published. Here\u2019s some more detail on those lacklustre numbers from B&amp;Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher. Analysts at AJ Bell have noted that despite Kingfisher being \u00a3368m of the way through a \u00a3600m share buyback, its stock has slumped to its lowest level since late 2014. The failure of this largesse to support the shares raises further questions over whether buybacks are a good value of creating long-term value for investors or not. Here comes Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, without whose analysis no retail sales release would be complete. We\u2019ve heard the numbers, which were better than expected, but here\u2019s Howard\u2019s slightly gloomier take on the shape of things to come: The outlook for consumers looks set to be highly challenging over the latter months of the year, even though a modicum of relief has come from consumer price inflation easing back to 2.6% in July from a near four-year high of 2.9% in May. Real income growth is currently negative, and it looks likely to remain so through the rest of 2017. Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2% Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year. The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u2019s sharp fall drops out). However, earnings growth will likely remain relatively muted and employment may well lose momentum. Time for some reaction to those UK retail sales figures, which narrowly beat forecasts with a 0.3% rise. This is what Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, has to say: July\u2019s retail sales figures were fairly encouraging given the recent intensification of the squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes and suggest that talk of a sharp consumer slowdown has been overdone. Admittedly, the 0.3% monthly expansion in retail sales volumes (consensus 0.2%) was a bit weaker than the recent upbeat surveys had suggested. What\u2019s more, the annual rate of sales volumes stood at just 1.3% in July \u2013 down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the 5-6% rates seen towards the end of 2016. But with July\u2019s monthly rise in sales volumes building on June\u2019s robust 0.6% increase, high-street spending appears to have carried a decent amount of momentum into Q3. There have been few signs of a sharp slowdown in spending growth away from the high street either. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: July\u2019s wet weather might have dampened fashion sales but the supermarkets\u2019 continued creativity together with a good month for homewares meant it was another good month for retailers overall. While headline inflation may have eased back slightly recently, shoppers are still feeling the squeeze from several months of rising prices and sluggish wage growth. But despite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in \u2013 encouraging them to trade nights out for nights in and switch brands for own label, for example. July\u2019s retail sales rose by 0.3% month-on-month according to the Office for National Statistics, above a Reuters consensus forecast of 0.2%. June\u2019s figures were revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%, a fairly sizeable revision. Shoppers tightened their belts on most things except food, which was up 1.5%. Ole Black, the ONS\u2019 top statistician calls it a \u201crelatively subdued picture\u201d, given that sales in all sectors but food declined. Here\u2019s a graph from the Office for National Statistics showing the sectoral breakdown. A quick update on President Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly fractious relationship with the US business community, which has seen him disband two business councils. Apple chief executive Tim Cook is the latest chief executive to voice his disapproval of Trump\u2019s lacklustre response to the far right\u2019s manoeuvres in Charlottesville, Virginia. Here are some excerpts from an email to staff, leaked to Buzzfeed, in which Cook was pulling no punches. I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans. What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. He added that \u201cin the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organisations who work to rid our country of hate. He\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is too. Apple will make two $1m donations, one to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the other to the Anti-Defamation League. The tech giant will also double any donations that its staff make to those organisations and any other human rights groups until September 30. While we\u2019re waiting for UK retail sales to drop, here\u2019s a reminder of what looks likely to be one of the week\u2019s biggest business news stories, President Donald Trump\u2019s broadside at Amazon and growing friction with US captains of industry. With a single tweet, the President knocked $5bn off the Amazon share price. Amazon, of course, is run by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, never Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader. You can tell that jobs are important to President Trump thanks to the capital letters and exclamation marks in the tweet immediately preceding the assault on Amazon. Trump\u2019s relationship with the US business world is looking fragile after he disbanded his business advisory council of chief executives, after many of them fled for the exit in the light of his response to the violence surrounding a far right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Let\u2019s have another look ahead to today\u2019s UK retail sales figures, due for release by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am. The British shopper is a hardy soul, not likely to be deterred by global concerns such as the threat of nuclear war, the rise of the far right in the US, or the impending four-year absence of Big Ben\u2019s bongs. This resilience in the face of adversity is one reason why pundits expect a rise, albeit a modest one of 0.2%, in July retail sales. That\u2019s a slowdown on 0.6% in June but any increase is better than nothing. Here\u2019s one more comment from Michael Hewson at CMC Markets:- The squeeze on consumer incomes has been particularly apparent in this year\u2019s retail sales data which got off to a poor start in Q1, but did improve somewhat in Q2, with a decent rebound at the end of the quarter. As Q3 gets underway there is some optimism that the July numbers will also show an improvement, if last week\u2019s BRC retail sales numbers are any guide. They do tend to act as a leading indicator to the official numbers, and show a modest improvement last week, with today\u2019s retail sales numbers expected to show a rise of 0.2%, down from June\u2019s 0.6% The FTSE has been open nearly 10 minutes now and is down around 15 points at 7417, after Kingfisher reported a worse-than-expected second quarter performance for its DIY chain B&amp;Q. Here\u2019s Panmure Gordon\u2019s veteran City analyst David Buik with a brief glimpse at the numbers. And there was nothing to shout \u201cHouse\u201d about either at Mecca Bingo owner Rank Group, where full year pre-tax profit is down 7% to \u00a379.7m on revenues broadly flat at \u00a3707m. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has been reading the runes regarding the ECB\u2019s plans, with one eye on the meeting of central bank minds at next week\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium. We saw a another decent day for European markets yesterday helped in no small part by a report citing European Central Bank sources that ECB President Mario Draghi would not be making any references to monetary policy at next week\u2019s Jackson Hole annual central bank symposium. This helped push the euro towards its lowest levels this month against the US dollar, while helping support European stocks. Speculation had been building that we might get an early steer on the ECB\u2019s intentions with respect to the slow winding down of the banks \u20ac60bn a month stimulus program. The report went on to say that any discussion would have to wait until the autumn, which suggests that we may well have to wait until the October meeting, before the ECB looks at showing its hand, on the timing of any tapering program. Stock markets in Europe have been on something of a winning streak of late but that looks like it might come to an end today. It\u2019s red ink across the board, according opening calls from the folks at IG. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. July retail sales due for release at 9.30am will give us an inkling of how the UK consumer is faring given the ongoing squeeze on household incomes, which persists despite inflation coming in lower than expected earlier this week. Eurozone inflation data is out half an hour later at 10am. Monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic is also in focus, after minutes of the Federal Reserve came out last night indicating a divide over when to raise rates. European Central Bank minutes are due for release at 12.30pm today, with analysts watching out for some sign of the Bank\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-month stimulus programme being unwound. In the City, there are are financial performance figures from casino and bingo firm Rank and Kingfisher, the group behind DIY brand B&amp;Q. On today\u2019s agenda: \u2022 9.30 BST: UK retail sales for July \u2022 10.00 BST: Eurozone inflation data \u2022 12.30 BST: European Central Bank minutes",

Latest Office for National Statistics data show that total real average weekly earnings decreased by 0.5% in the three months to June, which was marginally down from a peak drop of 0.6% in May. Inflation will likely be close to 3% through the latter months of 2017, while earnings growth seems set to hover around 2%</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence is brittle and caution over making major purchases appears to have been reinforced by heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties. </p> </blockquote> <p>However, there is cause for cause for cautious optimism looking into next year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The squeeze on consumers should progressively ease in 2018 due to inflation falling back markedly (as the impact of sterling\u2019s sharp fall drops out). However, earnings growth will likely remain relatively muted and employment may well lose momentum. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T09:54:58.075Z\">at 10.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59955976e4b0de68769707c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T08:57:44.588Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for some reaction to those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/aug/17/uk-retail-sales-to-give-hint-on-consumer-confidence-business-live?page=with:block-599552a6e4b0ae030608b164#block-599552a6e4b0ae030608b164\">UK retail sales figures</a>, which narrowly beat forecasts with a 0.3% rise.</p> <p>This is what Ruth Gregory, UK economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, has to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July\u2019s retail sales figures were fairly encouraging given the recent intensification of the squeeze on consumers\u2019 real incomes and suggest that talk of a sharp consumer slowdown has been overdone. </p> <p>Admittedly, the 0.3% monthly expansion in retail sales volumes (consensus 0.2%) was a bit weaker than the recent upbeat surveys had suggested. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, the annual rate of sales volumes stood at just 1.3% in July \u2013 down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the 5-6% rates seen towards the end of 2016.</p> <p>But with July\u2019s monthly rise in sales volumes building on June\u2019s robust 0.6% increase, high-street spending appears to have carried a decent amount of momentum into Q3. There have been few signs of a sharp slowdown in spending growth away from the high street either. </p> </blockquote> <p>Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at <strong>Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July\u2019s wet weather might have dampened fashion sales but the supermarkets\u2019 continued creativity together with a good month for homewares meant it was another good month for retailers overall.</p> <p>While headline inflation may have eased back slightly recently, shoppers are still feeling the squeeze from several months of rising prices and sluggish wage growth.</p> <p>But despite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in \u2013 encouraging them to trade nights out for nights in and switch brands for own label, for example.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T09:55:12.764Z\">at 10.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-599552a6e4b0ae030608b164\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T08:33:07.657Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK retail sales growth flat but beats expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>July\u2019s <strong>retail sales</strong> rose by 0.3% month-on-month according to the Office for National Statistics, above a Reuters consensus forecast of 0.2%.</p> <p>June\u2019s figures were revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%, a fairly sizeable revision.</p> <p>Shoppers tightened their belts on most things except food, which was up 1.5%.</p> <p>Ole Black, the ONS\u2019 top statistician calls it a \u201crelatively subdued picture\u201d, given that sales in all sectors but food declined. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a graph from the Office for National Statistics showing the sectoral breakdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76e32eb08b4ca3f330d6b820ef196ceee17cd52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76e32eb08b4ca3f330d6b820ef196ceee17cd52/0_0_717_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"ONS graph showing food sales rose in July but all other sectors declined\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Office for National Statistics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T09:55:22.714Z\">at 10.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59954e4ce4b0ae030608b152\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-17T08:23:27.746Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick update on <strong>President Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s increasingly fractious relationship with the US business community, which has seen him disband two business councils.</p> <p><strong> Apple</strong> chief executive <strong>Tim Cook</strong> is the latest chief executive to voice his disapproval of Trump\u2019s lacklustre response to the far right\u2019s manoeuvres in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p> <p>Here are some excerpts from an email to staff, leaked to Buzzfeed, in which Cook was pulling no punches.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights.</p> <p>Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.</p> <p>What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country.

      "bodyText": "Asda has reported its first quarterly rise in sales for three years as the UK\u2019s third largest supermarket chain said customers were responding to price cuts and store improvements. Sales, excluding petrol, rose 1.8% in the three months to the end of June partly thanks to a boost from Easter trading. While Asda flagged its strategy of cutting prices on key items, a return to grocery price inflation spurred by the fall in the value of sterling is also likely to have helped the chain, owned by US retailer Walmart. Supermarkets have been struggling to cope with the rapid expansion of discounters Aldi and Lidl in the UK, which forced them to cut prices on many everyday basics. Asda said trading was particularly strong over Easter, with sales up 16%. Adjusting for the timing of the holiday, sales at established stores were up by 0.7% on the same period last year. Industry watchers said the results were cheering for Walmart. \u201cWhile this comes off the back of a 7.5% decline in the prior year, it is nevertheless an early sign that Walmart is addressing some of the issues that have long since plagued the UK operation,\u201d said Neil Saunders, the managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive, Doug McMillon, said he was encouraged by the UK arm\u2019s performance. \u201cIn June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction.\u201d The company said there had been improvements in customer numbers and spending. But Walmart\u2019s figures indicated that Asda\u2019s sales rise had partly been at the expense of profits, with operating income and gross margins down during the quarter. Asda\u2019s president and chief executive, Sean Clarke, said: \u201cOur continued focus on delivering great value and service meant 275,000 new customers chose to shop at Asda in the second quarter, particularly during Easter. \u201dWe will continue to work collaboratively with our suppliers to create the best products, make investments where they matter most to our customers, and ensure that we are fit for purpose in what remains a competitive market.\u201d The recent improvement in trading comes after Asda posted its worst annual figures since being taken over by Walmart in 1999, as fierce competition in the UK supermarket sector took its toll. The supermarket chain admitted its performance was \u201cbehind expectations\u201d after pre-tax profit for 2016 fell 19% to \u00a3791.7m. Accounts filed at Companies House also showed sales fell to \u00a321.6bn from \u00a322.3bn. All the \u201cbig four\u201d grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons - have suffered from upheaval in the industry in recent years. Many consumers are swapping their weekly shop for more frequent visits to small local stores as they try to save money or cut down on food waste. The rise of online shopping has also hit large supermarkets who have been forced to cut costs as a result. Last week, it emerged that thousands of Asda workers were facing redundancy or a dramatic cut in their working hours as it looks to cut costs.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s consumers are taking a more cautious approach to shopping as higher inflation above the level of earnings eats into their spending power. Only higher spending on food in supermarkets kept retail sales growing last month, with declines in all other main sectors, according to figures published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Growth in retail sales volumes was static at 0.3% in July after the ONS revised the figure for June down to the same level, although the result still beat analysts\u2019 expectations for a rise of 0.2%. Some economists blamed wet weather in July for weaker sales by fashion retailers, after sunnier conditions in June brought shoppers out in force. Strong food sales in stores at 1.5%, up from 1.1% a month earlier, helped offset a decline elsewhere, said Ole Black, an ONS senior statistician. \u201cWhile the overall growth is the same as in June, trends in growth in different sectors are proving quite volatile,\u201d he said. The annual rate of sales volume growth was 1.3% in July, down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the higher rates towards the end of 2016. High street stores selling clothing and footwear were among the hardest hit, experiencing a fall of 0.5% in July compared with a month earlier. However, consumers spent more online, according to the data, helping sales to increase by 15.1% year-on-year and by 0.3% month-on-month, accounting for approximately 16% of all retail spending. B&amp;Q and Screwfix owner, Kingfisher, Europe\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, reported on Thursday that second quarter sales had slumped, driven by a 10.7% decline in the sale of seasonal goods such as barbecues and garden furniture at B&amp;Q, following a strong first quarter boosted by better weather. Wet weather in July also affected fashion sales, with worse conditions possibly on the horizon for retailers, said Keith Richardson of Lloyds Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that there may be dark clouds on the way,\u201d he said. Although spending was higher at the supermarket checkout, prices have been rising while the phenomenon known as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d has cut the size of many products for consumers, maintaing profits for producers. But the cost of food could continue to rise further, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which estimates pork meat and rice commodity prices rose by 21% and 11% respectively between May and June alone. Supermarkets have been tempting shoppers to keep spending, or encouraging them to switch brands for own-label products, according to Richardson. \u201cDespite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in,\u201d he said. The figures come as the economy shows greater signs of resilience than expected, with the UK recording its lowest level of unemployment since the mid 1970s. Inflation remains steady at 2.6%, thanks to falling fuel prices, alleviating some of the squeeze on real wages at a time when households are facing uncertainty from Brexit. However, rail fares will rise by 3.6% from next year, after July\u2019s retail price index came in higher than expected on Tuesday, leading the government to prepare the steepest hike in average ticket prices for five years. The number of people cutting down on household spending is at the highest level for two years, as more than half of Britons said they looked to lower expenditure in the second quarter of 2017, according to Nielsen\u2019s latest Global Survey of Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions. The market research firm found consumer confidence has fallen sharply since the EU referendum, with the UK slipping from the second most confident country in Europe, behind only Denmark, to ninth place. The drop in retail sales adds to mounting problems for many small businesses that depend on consumers to stay afloat, at a time of rising production costs with higher levels of inflation, according to Mike Cherry, national chair at the Federation of Small Businesses. \u201cSmall business owners are paying themselves less, struggling to award pay rises and pushing up prices in an attempt to absorb increased outgoings. This threatens to further stifle already reduced consumer spending power,\u201d he said. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the retail sales figures showed continuing consumer caution amid squeezed purchasing power and weakened confidence. \u201cThe squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, despite easing marginally from May\u2019s peak,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate declined to 5.6% in July, down from 5.7% in June. Data shows employment grew by 27,900 jobs in July and jobs growth has continued for 10 months in a row \u2013 the longest positive monthly streak since 2010. Over the past 12 months, there have now been 239,373 jobs created, in seasonally adjusted terms, at an annual growth rate of 2% \u2013 up from 0.9% in February. Over the same period, full-time employment has increased by 197,700 people (2.4% annual pace), while part-time employment has increased by 41,600 people (1.1% annual pace). Economists say the labour market appears a bit more \u201crobust\u201d than it was during its soft patch last year, helping to \u201ccushion\u201d workers from the economy\u2019s record low wages growth of 1.9%. According the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) this week, the economy has now recorded the 20th consecutive quarter of falling wages growth for private sector workers. The National Australia Bank economist Tapas Strickland said it was likely the unemployment rate could keep declining from 5.6%, since trend employment growth was \u201cwell above\u201d the break-even level of 15,500 jobs a month that is needed to keep the unemployment rate unchanged. \u201cIf this trend rate of growth continued, it would be enough to drop the unemployment rate by 0.1% every two months assuming a constant participation rate,\u201d he said. The Turnbull government is promoting the fact that nearly 240,000 jobs have been created in the last 12 months and some economists agree the labour market has some \u201csolid momentum\u201d. \u201cThe pace of employment growth, and particularly full-time jobs growth, has clearly cranked up more than a few notches as 2017 has progressed,\u201d Commonwealth Bank economist John Peters said. \u201cOver the past six months, monthly jobs growth has averaged 33,000 per month ... [and] the split between full-time and part-time jobs growth has altered substantially in the past six months or so, and in the right direction towards full-time jobs creation.\u201d Other economists are less sanguine. Paul Dales, the chief economist of Capital Economics, said the growth in full-time jobs over the past year had \u201cgone a long way to reversing\u201d the trend of the previous four years, when businesses preferred to take on part-time workers, but he remained unconvinced that the labour market \u201chas, once and for all, turned a corner\u201d. \u201cThe past volatility of the data suggests it\u2019s wise not to get too excited,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the recent improvement poses an upside risk to our cautious gross domestic product growth, inflation and interest rate forecasts.\u201d Dales warned in June that the share of national income going to workers was close to a 50-year low because the extra income generated by recent soaring commodity prices had \u201call gone into the pocket of business\u201d. Peters agreed that despite the strong growth in employment in recent months there was still plenty of spare capacity in the jobs market. He said the underemployment rate was running at 8.8% in May and, in conjunction with the June unemployment rate of 5.6%, the labour underutilisation rate was still running above 14%, at 14.4%. \u201cWe will need to see further sustained robust employment growth to really see this [underutilisation rate] dropping to zones which may be a precursor of intensifying wage pressures,\u201d he said. July\u2019s employment growth was driven by an increase in the participation rate, which rose 0.1% to 65.1% \u2013 its highest since January 2016.",

      "bodyText": "The controversial Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which is mulling a $900m loan for a rail link for Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, may be investigated by the auditor general. The potential inquiry by the auditor general, who has wide-ranging access and information-gathering powers, follows interventions from a former federal treasurer and environment groups. In March, Wayne Swan wrote to the auditor general requesting that he urgently begin an investigation into the \u201cunacceptable fiscal risks\u201d Naif posed to the commonwealth. Swan warned that Naif risked \u201cmisallocating billions of dollars of public money,\u201d specifically raising the secrecy around Naif\u2019s consideration of a loan to Adani, its lack of adequate staffing and the pressure imposed on the organisation by \u201ca domineering minister\u201d. \u201cI am concerned the real risk of maladministration may lead to significant losses to the commonwealth in the future and the misallocation of resources due to political pressure and poor governance, resulting in funds failing to be allocated to more worthy purposes,\u201d Swan said in his letter. The auditor general replied last month, informing Swan that he had considered the request, and decided to include an audit of Naif among the potential performance audits to be completed in the 2017-18 work program. The auditor general is independent of the government, and the decision on whether an audit of Naif goes ahead depends on a number of factors, including the priorities of the parliament and public submissions. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), which assists the auditor general, says the potential audit program is published so that the public can make their views known to the auditor general. Seizing on that opportunity, five non-government organisations who say they represent a total of more than two million Australians wrote to the auditor general this week encouraging him to conduct the audit. \u201cThe proper administration of Naif is a matter of significant public interest,\u201d wrote the heads of the Australian Conservation Foundation, 350.org, Greenpeace, Market Forces and GetUp. \u201cIt concerns the management of $5bn in commonwealth funds.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest companies have been told that a lack of diversity in their boardrooms could hinder government plans to increase trade with non-EU countries after Brexit. The warning comes as a report shows the number of FTSE 100 businesses with no ethnic minority representation at senior level has fallen from 62 to 58. However, none of the companies have CEOs or chief financial officers who are women from ethnic minority groups. The study by the executive search company Green Park found that while there has been a rise in the number of non-white workers in the upper echelons of FTSE 100 companies, there appears to be a glass ceiling at the top levels of management. Green Park\u2019s chief executive, Raj Tulsiani, said the findings should be viewed against the backdrop of looming trade talks with dozens of countries outside the EU. \u201cIn light of the UK\u2019s desire to increase trade with non-EU countries, the ongoing inability of our leading companies to attract and retain leaders from east Asian and African backgrounds should be a matter for serious concern,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s aspiration to be outward looking and open to business with the non-European world is hardly enhanced by the continued lack of challenge in the boards of our leading companies, still statistically and behaviourally dominated by men of similar cultural and educational backgrounds.\u201d The study found that the senior management at Rolls-Royce is one of the least diverse in the FTSE 100. The engineering group ranked 90th for employing people from ethnic minorities and women at senior levels. Last year, a government-backed review of ethnic diversity recommended that Britain\u2019s top companies should bring an end to all-white boardrooms by 2021. The report, led by Sir John Parker, the outgoing chairman of the mining company Anglo American, said businesses were failing to promote sufficient numbers of people from ethnic minority groups to senior positions. The results from Green Park\u2019s annual leadership 10,000 survey raises questions over whether this ambition is achievable. While there has been a small decrease in the number of companies with all-white boards, the number of people from ethnic minorities holding one of the most senior roles \u2013 chair, chief executive or chief financial officer \u2013 has fallen by 18%. There are three non-white chairs of FTSE 100 companies and four non-white chief executives, according to the survey. Six of the chief executives are women, including Alison Brittain of Whitbread and ITV\u2019s Carolyn McCall. There has been a 5% rise in minority representation outside the board, but the figures suggest a problem with progression to the highest levels of FTSE 100 companies, Tulsiani said. \u201cIt is a positive trend that in the pipeline we are doing better around race, but at the top of the pyramid, we have gone backwards slightly,\u201d he said. Rolls-Royce said it was working to bring more people from diverse backgrounds into its workforce. \u201cWe are well aware of the need to attract talent from more diverse backgrounds, not only into our business, but into the wider engineering and technology industry. It is particularly challenging to attract BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] engineers where numbers across the UK are currently low,\u201d said Heather McVicar, a global diversity and inclusion consultant at Rolls-Royce.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland has claimed Toblerone\u2019s shape is no longer distinctive enough to be a valid trademark, in legal documents defending its right to launch a copycat bar. Last month, the budget chain was forced to delay the launch of its Twin Peaks bar, which has two humps rather than the single peaks of Toblerone, after a legal warning from the brand\u2019s owner, a Swiss division of Mondel\u0113z. Documents seen by the Guardian reveal the legal wrangle has escalated, with a claim and counter-claim filed at the high court. Toblerone is one of Poundland\u2019s most popular products, with 11m bars sold last year. But the retailer says it decided to bring out Twin Peaks \u201cin response to the unfavourable reception\u201d that greeted Toblerone\u2019s new version with fewer chunks, launched last year. Speaking at the time of the launch, Poundland\u2019s trading director, Barry Williams, said it had created an alternative with \u201ca British taste, and with all the spaces in the right places\u201d. In legal defence documents filed earlier this week, Poundland says the triangular prism shape of the Toblerone bar, which was registered under an EU trademark in 1997, is no longer distinctive partly because of the existence of the new version. It claims that any good reputation enjoyed by the Toblerone bar trademark has been \u201cirretrievably abandoned\u201d by the launch of the product with bigger gaps between its nine chunks, which the public \u201cconsider unfavourably in comparison\u201d. Poundland also says the 12-chunk registered version is no longer on sale in the UK, where an 11-chunk bar has been sold since about 2010. The legal row echoes Nestl\u00e9\u2019s long-running battle with rival Cadbury, also owned by Mondel\u0113z, to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK. In the latest round, the court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s product had \u201cno inherent distinctiveness\u201d. Sally Britton, an intellectual property lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said the Toblerone battle covered the same issue of whether a shape could be distinctive enough to function as a trademark. \u201cA trademark is something that distinguishes your goods and services from others. The more you use a mark consistently, the stronger your rights should be. There is an argument that Toblerone is weakening its rights by changing the shape of its bar,\u201d Britton said. She said Toblerone clearly was a distinctive shape and, unlike KitKat, already registered as a trademark, which was why Mondel\u0113z was so keen to prevent its mark from becoming generic. \u201cIf other businesses are selling chocolate bars of an identical shape to Toblerone it could be argued that its shape is losing its distinctiveness and is not functioning as a trademark. That\u2019s why Toblerone is taking action,\u201d Britton said. Poundland claims in the court documents that the shape of Twin Peaks \u201cis new and creates a different overall impression upon the informed user\u201d, adding that it had successfully applied for a UK-registered design protection of the bar\u2019s double-humped shape, which is supposedly inspired by the Wrekin, a hill in Shropshire near the company\u2019s head office. The document claims that the soft \u201cformless packaging\u201d of Twin Peaks, and its clearly different name and shape, mean \u201cno member of the relevant public would mistake one for the other\u201d. It also says the products taste different. Mondel\u0113z claims Poundland and its supplier Walkers Chocolates have infringed its trademarks on the overall shape of the bar, the pyramid-shaped chocolate chunk or \u201cpeaks\u201d, prism-shaped gold Toblerone packaging and the Matterhorn mountain logo. It says Poundland\u2019s Twin Peaks bar is \u201cdeceptively and confusingly similar\u201d to Toblerone to the extent that shoppers may believe it is produced by Mondel\u0113z or has been otherwise approved by the company. The claim by Mondel\u0113z says it made \u00a317m in net revenues from Toblerone in the UK last year and spent \u00a34.3m on marketing. The company is seeking damages in relation to trademark infringement and \u201cpassing off\u201d against Poundland and Walkers Chocolates. Although the Twin Peaks bar was flagged in an ITV documentary and promotional bars were sent out to journalists, it has never reached store shelves. Mondel\u0113z and Poundland declined to comment.",
