    "webTitle": "Fresh credit crunch fears as banks park record \u20ac453bn cash with ECB", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fresh fears about the eurozone banking system were raised when record amounts of cash were deposited with the European Central Bank and Italy's UniCredit spooked markets with a cash call on investors. Some \u20ac453bn (\u00a3378bn) was lodged in the ECB's \"deposit facility\" on Tuesday night in a move that some analysts feared showed banks were so concerned about lending it out to rivals that they would rather earn just 0.25% in interest from the central bank. The ECB also revealed that \u20ac15bn had been used from its emergency lending facility overnight on Tuesday, following \u20ac14.8bn borrowed the previous day. Bank stocks retreated from a stronger start to the new year after the Italian bank UniCredit attempted to entice investors to back a \u20ac7.5bn cash call by offering a big discount on the existing price of its shares. \"Interbank funding markets are getting more credit crunched, not less,\" said Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BCG Partners. Referring to the deposits at the ECB, she said: \"This shows how much fear there is still in the wholesale markets \u2013 that banks prefer to accept only 0.25% interest rate on their cash rather than lending it out at higher rates to other banks. \"Central banks are having to fund banks themselves because so many credit, wholesale and rates markets are not functioning normally and it is getting worse \u2026 Equity markets may have started 2012 with a strong start, but as far as the wholesale funding markets are concerned, the world is still a scary place.\" Some observers said it was not immediately clear that the deposits to the ECB could be equated to the \u20ac498bn that banks borrowed from the central bank in last month's three-year loans. Banks might be sitting on the cash in anticipation of needing fresh funds later in the year when their current form of financing, through bonds, would mature. The rights issue by UniCredit was initially thought to be priced at a 43% discount to its share price, but it later became clear the discount was a massive 69%. Required to raise extra capital by the European Banking Authority, UniCredit is one of a number of banks that are expected to need to tap their shareholders for cash. Its shares were briefly suspended as they fell following the details of the cash call \u2013 which had been signalled at the end of last year \u2013 and shares in other banks across the eurozone, such as Commerzbank in Germany, were also dragged lower. Amid the anxiety about the banking system, Greece kept up the pressure on its eurozone partners to bankroll a new bailout when its prime minister echoed comments from his spokesman, who has warned the country could be forced out of the single currency in the next three months. Lucas Papademos, Greece's prime minister, told union leaders they need to accept more pay cuts if the country's paymasters were to agree the final terms of its second \u20ac130bn bailout. \"If we want to secure our most significant achievements \u2013 participation in the euro and avoidance of a massive, vertical income devaluation that a disorderly bankruptcy and exit from the euro would lead to \u2013 then we must accept a short-income reduction,\" he told union leaders. Officials from the so-called troika are due in Athens on 15 January and Papademos said \"the coming few weeks will be extremely crucial\". There were also fears that the eurozone would slip back into recession following the release of purchasing managers' index (PMI) data, a key indicator of economic activity. \"The uplift in the eurozone PMI in December does little to dispel fears of the region sliding back into recession,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Sterling hit a 15-month high against the euro while the single currency was at an 11-year low against the yen. Some analysts were heartened by an auction of government bonds by Germany, which had spooked investors last November when it failed to sell as many bonds as it had hoped at a previous auction. Portugal also issued \u20ac1bn of bonds while France is scheduled to conduct an auction on Thursday. Banks such as ING and UBS have also begun to raise cash by selling bonds to finance their operations this year, when it is estimated that about $1tn of bank bonds will mature. Most of the focus was on the banking sector. UniCredit's \u20ac7.5bn rights issue was seen as a test of investor appetite for bank shares and Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said the larger than expected discount indicated either that shareholders lacked confidence in UniCredit or an act of \"desperation\" on its part. The bank said the pricing reflected \"current market conditions\". Cooper said \"the level of discount is psychological, reflecting the fears and worries of investors, trying to tempt them into a bargain\". The Italian bank's need to raise fresh funds to survive the eurozone crisis is second only to Spain's Santander, and the size of the rights issue is more than half its stock market value of \u20ac12bn. It is the third time UniCredit has tapped investors for cash since the 2008 banking crisis and its shares have fallen 25% since it announced the share offering in mid-November. The Financial Times reported that Spain's banks would have to take provisions of \u20ac50bn to clean up their balance sheets.",

      "bodyText": "Switzerland's central bank was embroiled in an insider trading scandal after bank chief Philipp Hildebrand was accused of speculating on currency transactions only weeks before he instituted dramatic policy changes that shifted prices in his favour. The accusations, which have rocked the Swiss banking industry, were made by Swiss weekly newspaper Die Weltwoche in a statement before its Thursday publication. It said that previous reports that Hildebrand's wife was responsible for the foreign exchange transactions were misplaced and it was the bank chief who was behind the purchase and selling of currency that triggered an investigation by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The bank chairman also made several other dollar and euro transactions on the foreign exchange market between March and October last year, according to Die Weltwoche, which is close to the far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP). Hildebrand has come under sustained attack from the SVP and its vice-president Christoph Blocher following the bank chief's efforts to bring down the value of the Swiss franc against the dollar and the euro. The SNB shocked foreign exchange markets last September when it imposed a cap on the value of the franc against the euro to stop the currency soaring and thereby hurting Swiss exporters' earnings. The Swiss weekly claimed that in March alone, Hildebrand bought US dollars worth SFr1.1m, saying it had access to extracts from the Hildebrands' banking documents. The SNB refused to comment. The bank that allegedly handled the transactions, Banque Sarasin, said an employee had leaked client information by transmitting banking details to a lawyer close to the SVP. It said the member of staff had left the bank and could face prosecution. Die Weltwoche said the same employee had lodged a complaint against Hildebrand for alleged insider trading. \"We have all the bank statements showing the relevant transactions, plus a verbal assurance from a bank employee confirming that it was Hildebrand personally \u2013 not his wife \u2013 who ordered the transactions,\" Die Weltwoche's deputy editor-in-chief, Philipp Gut, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview on Wednesday. According to the newspaper, Hildebrand bought more than $500,000 in two transactions dated 15 August, which he then resold in September \u2013 making a profit of SFr75,000 (\u00a352,000). On 15 August the dollar was worth 0.79 francs, against 0.92 francs on 4 October. \"It's a classic forex [foreign exchange] speculation,\" Gut said. \"The only option for Hildebrand is to step down.\" The Zurich-based weekly said it had obtained bank statements showing that he was the one who had bought large amounts of dollars before selling them at a profit. The central bank said in December that an independent investigation into the Hildebrand couple's transactions found they complied with previously agreed ethical standards. The probe was reportedly launched after SVP figurehead Christoph Blocher went to then president Micheline Calmy-Rey with extracts of banking documents. Blocher, a billionaire, has so far refused to comment. A critic of SNB policy under Hildebrand, he is also a defender of Switzerland's banking secrecy laws. Three weeks earlier the bank chief's wife, Kashya Hildebrand, who runs an art gallery in Zurich, said she bought dollars due to the fact that they had \"hit a very low level and become ridiculously cheap\".

    "webTitle": "Banks brace for backlash  as bonus season arrives", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the most controversial annual bonus rounds ever is about to get under way in the City. The size of payouts at a time of rising unemployment and pay restraint in the wider economy will spark a fresh wave of protest about high pay in the financial industry, despite protestations from bankers that bonus pools are down markedly on 2010. But announcements of more than 125,000 job cuts last year mean bankers will find it harder to use their traditional excuse that they need to pay out big bonuses to retain top talent. Expectations are also mounting that even after the toll on jobs in 2011 \u2013 when the crisis in the eurozone conspired with regulatory changes to make investment banking less profitable \u2013 more bankers will lose their jobs this year as banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland dramatically scale back their size of the investment banking operations. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale began to restructure its investment bank on Wednesday, axing 880 jobs in Paris in a move that could signal losses are to come in the City. Even within the financial industry itself, bonus season sparks anger. David Fleming, national officer of the Unite union, which represents high street banking workers, warns of the \"disgust\" at the multimillion-pound rewards handed out to City bankers. \"Pay imbalances in the finance industry remain shockingly high,\" he said. \"The bonuses at the tops of these institutions must be curbed. Instead of paying casino bonuses to investment bankers, these companies should stop cutting the staff working hard to serve their customers.\" As it stands, 2011 was a difficult year for investment banks. Global investment banking fees sunk to their lowest level in three years, according to data published by Thomson Reuters on Wednesday. Yet banks face the tricky task of explaining that the proportion of revenue they are using for pay will be higher \u2013 because while revenue has fallen, they argue staff still need to be paid bonuses deferred from previous years. Rob Harbron, the economist who compiles a twice-yearly forecast of job cuts and bonuses, warns that there will more pressure on City jobs this year. \"If the eurozone crisis gets any worse, we could see downward revisions to our forecasts and a lot more job cuts in 2012,\" Harbron said. His latest forecasts for the Centre for Economics and Business Research are for \u00a34.2bn of bonus payments in 2011 \u2013 roughly a third of the \u00a311.6bn peak paid out just as the banking crisis took hold in 2008. Reuters calculates that 125,000 jobs were earmarked for the axe last year, although the losses will be phased over the next few years. Additionally, apart from the fall-off in business, bankers are also being told by regulators to curb bonus payments if they are not making enough profits to bolster their capital cushions. The key test of the appetite for confrontation will take place in a fortnight when Wall Street firms such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs publish figures for 2011. Two years ago, Goldman attempted to demonstrate \"restraint\" \u2013 even though the average pay deal was more than \u00a3300,000 per employee \u2013 by cutting the amount of revenue allocated to pay from 48% to 35.8% while its 400 partners contributed $500m to its charitable foundation, Goldman Sachs Gives. Such a move was possible during 2009 because the bank's revenues had doubled, but this year may prove more tricky as the Thomson Reuters data shows that fees collected by Goldman fell by more 11%. For UK banks, the pressure is on. Major investors represented by the Association of British Insurers have written to top bankers to tell them to \"significantly\" reduce their bonus pools. The government is facing pressure to use its 83% holding in Royal Bank of Scotland and 40% stake in Lloyds Banking Group to put restrictions on bonuses. Vince Cable, the business secretary, is preparing to publish proposals on executive pay later this month. UK Financial Investments, which controls the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks, is expected to again demand that any bonuses of more than \u00a32,000 is not paid in cash. RBS is thought to be preparing to pay out \u00a3500m in bonuses, half last year's levels. But, this may not be enough to deflect public anger. Andrew Simms, fellow of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, points out that the protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral in the heart of the financial district illustrate the new depth of feeling that has erupted since the 2008 crisis. \"This must be the most sensitive bonus round yet,\" said Simms.",

Two years ago, Goldman attempted to demonstrate \"restraint\" \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/21/goldman-sachs-bonus-cut\" title=\"\"> even though the average pay deal was more than \u00a3300,000 per employee</a> \u2013 by cutting the amount of revenue allocated to pay from 48% to 35.8% while its 400 partners contributed $500m to its charitable foundation, Goldman Sachs Gives. Such a move was possible during 2009 because the bank's revenues had doubled, but this year may prove more tricky as the Thomson Reuters data shows that fees collected by Goldman fell by more 11%.</p> <p>For UK banks, the pressure is on. Major investors represented by the Association of British Insurers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/05/banks-warned-cut-executive-pay\" title=\"\">have written to top bankers to tell them to \"significantly\" reduce their bonus pools</a>.</p> <p>The government is facing pressure to use its 83% holding in Royal Bank of Scotland and 40% stake in Lloyds Banking Group to put restrictions on bonuses. Vince Cable, the business secretary, is preparing to publish proposals on executive pay later this month.</p> <p>UK Financial Investments, which controls the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks, is expected to again demand that any bonuses of more than \u00a32,000 is not paid in cash. RBS is thought to be preparing to pay out \u00a3500m in bonuses, half last year's levels.</p> <p>But, this may not be enough to deflect public anger. Andrew Simms, fellow of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, points out that the protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral in the heart of the financial district illustrate the new depth of feeling that has erupted since the 2008 crisis. \"This must be the most sensitive bonus round yet,\" said Simms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fortunes of two of the UK's biggest retailers diverged during the crucial Christmas trading weeks, with Next yesterday reporting \"disappointing\" sales at its high street stores while John Lewis trumpeted \"outstanding\" figures after the chain proved a magnet for gift buyers. Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, blamed a frenzy of unplanned discounting by rivals and the mild autumn weather for weaker than expected sales at its stores and predicted another tough year as turmoil in the eurozone and high unemployment hit consumer confidence. \"December was definitely disappointing, as we didn't see a boost in the weeks that we saw a lot of snow last year,\" he said, adding that after 2010 disruption perhaps Britons had \"learned not to spend so much at Christmas\". Analysts estimated that like-for-like sales in Next stores fell more than 5% in the last two months of the year, resulting in a worse than expected 2.7% decline for the six months to 24 December. That weakness was offset by a strong performance at home shopping arm Directory, where sales jumped nearly 17%. Together the divisions delivered growth of 3.1% which was in line with guidance given to analysts in November. It was a rosier picture at employee-owned John Lewis, where like-for-like sales jumped 6.2% in the five weeks to 31 December. \"Sales during the four weeks to Christmas Eve were outstanding,\" said managing director Andy Street, flagging a new trading record of \u00a3133.1m set in the week before Christmas. John Lewis's \"never knowingly undersold\" pledge forces it to match rivals' promotions, a promise that cost it dear in the first six months of the year when profits dropped 54.5% to \u00a315.8m. Investors are keen to know if last month's crop of profit warnings from quoted retailers was a sign that Christmas, when many retailers make the bulk of their annual profits, had been a washout. John Lewis's clearance sale has attracted fewer customers than last year, when an impending VAT rise prompted a shopping spree, but the commercial director, Andrea O'Donnell, said the retailer was \"genuinely very pleased\" with its overall performance, with profit margins \"level\" with last year. New ranges and successful TV advertising campaigns had helped to cement John Lewis's reputation as a \"one-stop shop\" for Christmas gifts, said O'Donnell. \"We are much more front-of-mind than three years ago, when we were seen as a traditional home retailer,\" she said. \"In uncertain times people are increasingly looking for retailers they can trust, particularly at Christmas, when they are looking at making a big purchase.\" It also saw a strong performance from its home shopping arm, where sales jumped nearly 28%. Many fashion stores started reducing the price of winter clothing in early December after the mild autumn left them with piles of unsold winter coats and boots. The strategy is likely to have hit Next, which refuses to discount before Christmas with 10% more stock going into its Boxing Day sale. Wolfson said some of the discounting by rivals appeared to be an \"emergency and unplanned\" reaction to the tough trading conditions. \"One of the indications of that is the number of blanket discount days where everything had X% off,\" he said. Next is still on track to make annual profits of around \u00a3565m. Wolfson, however, was \"more cautious\" than three months ago about the outlook for sales in 2012 and predicted profits would be only \"slightly up\" in the coming year, sending its shares down 3.1% and pulling rivals chains down with it. \"It will be another year of walking up the down escalator,\" said Wolfson. Analysts are expected to make a small reduction to Next profit forecasts for the 2012-13 financial year. Despite the December sales fillip, John Lewis is also cautious about the 2012 outlook. \"We are forecasting for very low growth if not zero,\" said O'Donnell. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders, analyst at Conlumino, said John Lewis was probably the \"standout winner\" in terms of trading but that Next deserved credit for delivering growth \"profitably and largely at full margin\". \"While John Lewis will have had a profitable Christmas, margins are likely to have been eroded by price matching and this will result in lower profitability for the full year and a reduced bonus pool for partners,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Amec</strong>, the oil services group, has underperformed the market in the past twelve months, but analysts believe that could be about to change.</p> <p>Both Seymour Pierce and Liberum have issued buy notes on the business, helping its shares edge up 1p to 934p in a falling market. Kevin Lapwood at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Amec now trades at a significant discount to its oil service peers. Given the recent strength of the oil price, which should underpin future exploration and production activity and the increased activity in new hydrocarbon development activity such as shale gas fracking and oil shales, we believe this is unjustifiably low. Amec's current order book stands at \u00a33.3bn, which is up on the same time last year (\u00a33.1bn) and it has recently been awarded several significant new contracts. (Cygnus gas for GDF Suez, Claire Ridge west of Shetland, Cloudbreak ore handling plant in Australia for Fortescue Metals and two nuclear decommissioning contracts in the UK). We reiterate our buy stance with a 1250p target price. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Rob Mundy at Liberum said the company was one of the best value shares in the oil field services sector, trading at a much lower multiple than a similar engineering company, Wood Group.</p> <p>Overall the spectre of the eurozone crisis re-emerged to dampen the market's early enthusiasm. With a number of government bond auctions on the horizon, there was a mixed performance from debt sales from Germany and Portugal, while Hungary's financial stress was illustrated by news it had cancelled its bond sale. On Thursday France will mount its first debt auction of the year - with the prospect of a downgrade of its triple AAA rating from Standard and Poor's still looming in the background.</p> <p>On top of that, news that Italy's Unicredit had set its cash call at a 43% discount to its share price helped send shivers through the banking sector. As did European banks depositing a record number of funds overnight with the European Central Bank, showing their reluctance to invest elsewhere. So <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 0.25p to 20.76p while <strong>HSBC</strong> dropped 4.9p to 500p. But <strong>Barclays</strong> bucked the trend, adding 2.05p to 188.35p.</p> <p>By the close the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> had lost 31.46 points to 5668.45 having earlier climbed as high as 5719. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The FTSE gave back some of the gains it made on Tuesday as the old fears surrounding the eurozone crept back into peoples' minds. For at least 48 hours though investors focused on something different which had been the improvement in economic data providing an excuse to buy equities, but the party seems to now be over as sovereign debt concerns reemerged today. </blockquote> <p>Disappointing Christmas trading from <strong>Next</strong>, along with a cautious outlook statement, left investors checking out of the retail sector.

      "bodyText": "Amec, the oil services group, has underperformed the market in the past twelve months, but analysts believe that could be about to change. Both Seymour Pierce and Liberum have issued buy notes on the business, helping its shares edge up 1p to 934p in a falling market. Kevin Lapwood at Seymour Pierce said: Amec now trades at a significant discount to its oil service peers. Given the recent strength of the oil price, which should underpin future exploration and production activity and the increased activity in new hydrocarbon development activity such as shale gas fracking and oil shales, we believe this is unjustifiably low. Amec's current order book stands at \u00a33.3bn, which is up on the same time last year (\u00a33.1bn) and it has recently been awarded several significant new contracts. (Cygnus gas for GDF Suez, Claire Ridge west of Shetland, Cloudbreak ore handling plant in Australia for Fortescue Metals and two nuclear decommissioning contracts in the UK). We reiterate our buy stance with a 1250p target price. Meanwhile Rob Mundy at Liberum said the company was one of the best value shares in the oil field services sector, trading at a much lower multiple than a similar engineering company, Wood Group. Overall the spectre of the eurozone crisis re-emerged to dampen the market's early enthusiasm. With a number of government bond auctions on the horizon, there was a mixed performance from debt sales from Germany and Portugal, while Hungary's financial stress was illustrated by news it had cancelled its bond sale. On Thursday France will mount its first debt auction of the year - with the prospect of a downgrade of its triple AAA rating from Standard and Poor's still looming in the background. On top of that, news that Italy's Unicredit had set its cash call at a 43% discount to its share price helped send shivers through the banking sector. As did European banks depositing a record number of funds overnight with the European Central Bank, showing their reluctance to invest elsewhere. So Royal Bank of Scotland fell 0.25p to 20.76p while HSBC dropped 4.9p to 500p. But Barclays bucked the trend, adding 2.05p to 188.35p. By the close the FTSE 100 had lost 31.46 points to 5668.45 having earlier climbed as high as 5719. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: The FTSE gave back some of the gains it made on Tuesday as the old fears surrounding the eurozone crept back into peoples' minds. For at least 48 hours though investors focused on something different which had been the improvement in economic data providing an excuse to buy equities, but the party seems to now be over as sovereign debt concerns reemerged today. Disappointing Christmas trading from Next, along with a cautious outlook statement, left investors checking out of the retail sector. Next lost 85p to \u00a326.56 while Marks &amp; Spencer fell 8.2p to 308.8p. Supermarkets were also under pressure ahead of their Christmas trading updates. Morrisons dipped 6.3p to 321.7p despite Barclays Capital raising its target price from 315p to 345p and J Sainsbury slipped 4.8p to 305.5p. Online fashion specialist Asos dropped 10p to \u00a313.20 as analysts at Espirito Santo drew negative conclusions from the Next statement and issued a sell note: Next [confirmed] that November and December was tougher than expected with higher level of competitor discounting. Having monitored the website, it feels like Asos was one of those discounting, so even if UK third quarter sales number is better than the second quarter's 1%, we think there must be some hit to UK gross margin. For those who point to Next's strong directory/online performance (16.9%), Asos management itself said that this was not a like for like comparison at the interims as Next has a different (older), more resilient customer demographic. Also, while international growth momentum could continue to offset UK weakness, press stories suggesting that the Australian clothing market (one of the fastest growing markets for Asos) has been weak and heavily promotional over Christmas as a result of unseasonable weather (though would expect online to be outperforming bricks and mortar here). A profit warning from Asos is unlikely in our view but any slowdown in growth momentum could lead to further de-rating. Elsewhere struggling HMV lost 0.35p to 3p and Clinton Cards closed 0.25p lower at 11p ahead of a Christmas trading update on Thursday. With the oil price holding firm amid the possibility of supply disruptions from Iran after the EU agreed sanctions against the country, BG added 1p to 1429.5p and BP was 2.4p better at 473.45p. Utilities stocks were in demand as investors moved away from riskier assets, with United Utilities up 9p at 620.5p and Severn Trent rising 17p to \u00a315.37. ITV added 0.7p to 71.05p, as the broadcaster turned in a good performance over the festive period, helped by the success of Downton Abbey. Panmure Gordon's Alex DeGroote issued a buy note, saying: It is reported that ITV had 29.7% share of peak time viewing on Christmas Day. This is a marked step-up year on year (from 22.1%). In context, this is also ITV's best share of peak-time viewing since 2004. Multi-channel fragmentation is no longer a meaningful drag. But Icap lost 7.1p to 344.9p as the interdealer broker's shares went ex-dividend. Among the mid-caps Domino's Pizza put on 27.7p to 441.5p after an upbeat trading statement, while IT group Micro Focus International added 7.1p to 393.8p after buy notes from Collins Stewart, which raised its target price from 400p to 466p, and Panmure Gordon. Panmure said: Micro Focus' three-phased turnaround is already delivering impressive results. \"Pile in early\" and ride the re-rating as Micro Focus does growth and returns in 2012. There is also the possibility of a renewed bid for the business. Finally Eurasia Mining jumped 23% to 0.8p despite the company saying it knew of no reason for the rise.",

      "bodyText": "There's something of a \"phoney war\" quality to the first few days of 2012. Stock markets are rising on the back of so-so economic data, which in itself is an indication of how much bad news is priced into markets. Bank lending is flat, the housing market is going sideways at best, and there is a bit more juice in the construction sector than predicted. In normal times, the financial markets would look askance at figures showing the economy to be on course for zero growth, or perhaps even a mild contraction, in the fourth quarter. But the economy is not actually tanking at the moment, and that is felt to be good news. It is a similar story in the eurozone. Nick Parsons, the head of strategy at National Australia Bank, rightly notes that the economic numbers released so far in 2012 point to an increasing divergence between the strong and weak countries of the eurozone. The single currency, he notes tartly, was supposed to do the opposite: make economies like Greece, Italy and Spain more like Germany. But hey, Greece didn't leave or get booted out of the euro in the period between Christmas and New Year, and the contraction in the eurozone looks to be marginally less severe than feared just before Christmas. Athens may be holding a gun to the head of its single-currency partners by threatening to default unless it gets more bailout cash, but the euro is still in one piece, if only just. Are stock markets being a tad complacent about all this? You bet they are. Louise Cooper at BGC partners points out that record amounts of cash are being parked at the European Central Bank overnight: more than \u20ac450bn (\u00a3372bn) on Tuesday against \u20ac200bn in mid-November. This, according to Cooper, is evidence of a worsening credit crunch, because the money being lodged at the ECB for nugatory rates of interest would normally be available for banks that need to borrow short term from the wholesale money markets. European banks have a massive funding problem, and for the time being that is being disguised by large dollops of cheap money from the ECB and other central banks. There is no real strategy here, other than playing for time in the hope that something will come up. That looks unlikely. In early 1940, it was widely felt in Britain that Hitler \"had missed the bus\" by not attacking in the west straight after the invasion of Poland. He hadn't, as the invasions of Norway, the Low Countries and France showed. This phoney war is unlikely to last that long.",

Athens may be holding a gun to the head of its single-currency partners by threatening to default unless it gets more bailout cash, but the euro is still in one piece, if only just.</p> <p>Are stock markets being a tad complacent about all this? You bet they are. Louise Cooper at BGC partners points out that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jan/04/eurozone-data-highlights-contrasting-fortunes\" title=\"\">record amounts of cash are being parked at the European Central Bank overnight</a>: more than \u20ac450bn (\u00a3372bn) on Tuesday against \u20ac200bn in mid-November.</p> <p>This, according to Cooper, is evidence of a worsening credit crunch, because the money being lodged at the ECB for nugatory rates of interest would normally be available for banks that need to borrow short term from the wholesale money markets. European banks have a massive funding problem, and for the time being that is being disguised by large dollops of cheap money from the ECB and other central banks. There is no real strategy here, other than playing for time in the hope that something will come up.</p> <p>That looks unlikely. In early 1940, it was widely felt in Britain that Hitler \"had missed the bus\" by not attacking in the west straight after the invasion of Poland. He hadn't, as the invasions of Norway, the Low Countries and France showed. This phoney war is unlikely to last that long.</p>",
