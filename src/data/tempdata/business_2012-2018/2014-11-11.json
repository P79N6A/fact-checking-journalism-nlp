    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It ought to take a lot of good news to boost Vodafone\u2019s share price by 6%. Even after the sale of the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for \u00a380bn, and the dispatch of the bulk of the proceeds to shareholders, the company is still a \u00a350bn titan. What gem lay within the half-year figures to support such a strong reaction? There was no out-and-out sparkler. Guidance on top-line profits for the full-year barely budged: Vodafone expected to do no worse than \u00a311.6bn instead of \u00a311.4bn the last time it spoke. The interim dividend was nudged 2% higher, which hardly represents another outpouring of riches. As for free cash flow, it was \u201c\u00a30.0bn\u201d, as the statement put it \u2013 nil, as the rest of the world would say. Instead, the outbreak of enthusiasm flows from the vaguer idea that one of these quarters, Vodafone\u2019s service revenues (that is, revenues from voice, texts and data) will stop falling. The first quarter\u2019s decline was 4.25%; the second\u2019s was 1.5%. Keep that up and, after two years of going backwards, Vodafone could be back in growth early next year. Relative to low expectations, that\u2019s a big improvement, even if southern Europe (Italy down 9.7% in the second quarter; Spain at minus 9.3%) remains a drag. But the trends are improving everywhere apart from Portugal. That means chief executive Vittorio Colao could claim to have hit the spending accelerator at the right moment. His two-year \u00a37bn Project Spring capital expenditure top-up \u2013 designed to get Vodafone\u2019s 3G and 4G networks up to speed \u2013 may have landed in time to halt the persistent drip of customer defections. The new adventure into the UK broadband market will not be cost-free but it was inevitable: if BT wants to offer mobile phones, Vodafone had to fight back. As long as Colao doesn\u2019t get dragged into paying silly prices for TV content, and as long as Project Spring is not followed by an expensive Project Summer, cash flows should improve and find their way to shareholders. In other words, that 5% dividend yield looks safe-ish. Solid 5% yields at large companies are a rarity, as investors in supermarkets have learned. In the circumstances, the big share-price reaction was justified. It seems there is life in Vodafone after the Verizon Wireless excitement. Runway costs take off What a surprise: the cost of a building a new runway in the south-east has already run away from promoters\u2019 estimates. They are all guilty of over-optimism to the tune of a billion or three, according to the airports commission\u2019s harder-headed calculations. The commission itself has taken no risks with precise numbers. Thus we are told that the economic benefits of building a new runway at Heathrow would be \u00a3112bn-\u00a3211bn. What\u2019s \u00a399bn between friends? For the Heathrow Hub runway extension, the range is even wider at \u00a3101bn-\u00a3214bn. Gatwick comes in at \u00a342bn-\u00a3127bn. There is, of course, a reason why these estimates are so laughably wide. Everything depends on what other assumptions are plugged into the economic model. The \u00a3112bn figure for a new Heathrow runway is generated by the \u201crelative decline of Europe\u201d scenario; the \u00a3211bn comes from the \u201cglobal growth\u201d model. What these numbers really tell us is what we already know: expanding Heathrow generates the most benefits if you place a high economic value on more flights to inner China, Brazil, and all those other emerging markets. Expansion at Gatwick, however, would still get this column\u2019s vote: it would inflict less noise and pollution at home and would keep Heathrow\u2019s monopolistic tendencies in check. It also stands a greater chance of getting built. But don\u2019t risk a penny on Gatwick getting an official thumbs-up. The business lobby will now flog the economic argument relentlessly. There is no reason to doubt the independence of mind of chairman Sir Howard Davies and his commissioners but, in betting terms, this is starting to look like a two-horse race between Heathrow and Heathrow. Patent compromise \u201cThis a great deal for Britain,\u201d says chancellor George Osborne. OK, but surely you can\u2019t think it is greater than your original design of the patent box, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have made the tax breaks for intellectual property so generous in the first place. Welcome to the world of political compromise. Germany objected to Osborne\u2019s much championed patent box and Britain has had to give ground; quite how much ground is unclear as the details are, to say the least, cloudy. The Treasury denies a U-turn but that is what it looks like. The previous official line was that this Osborne flagship policy would survive European scrutiny intact. But compromise is sensible. The bigger fight against multinationals\u2019 tax avoidance wheezes requires an united front from Europe\u2019s big players. On the patent box, the UK had found itself standing shoulder to shoulder with Luxembourg, not a comfortable position. It is far better to agree a deal with Germany and concentrate on the main event.",

The Guardian, along with other newspapers last week gave the most detailed accounts yet of the devices used by Luxembourg officials to help companies minimise taxes. The strategies were often developed together with company leaders and served to entice multinationals to come to Luxembourg, so depriving other EU countries of badly needed income.

He should not be judged on the past,\u201d opined Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economics, taxation and customs. David Cameron tried to block Juncker from being commission president in the summer but largely due to his alleged federalist beliefs and the way in which he was selected once he became the candidate of the European People\u2019s party group. Cameron as chair of the G8 last year put corporate tax evasion high on the political agenda and since then the OECD had been working up more detailed schemes for information transfer between tax authorities.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s coffers will be boosted by hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of a record wave of fines which are expected to be announced by the City regulator on Wednesday to punish banks for lax systems which allowed rigging of currency markets. Six banks \u2013 including Barclays, HSBC and bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 are thought to be facing fines of up to \u00a3250m each for manipulating the \u00a33.5tn a day foreign exchange markets. The fines will be levied by the Financial Conduct Authority. The FCA\u2019s US counterparts are expected to levy their own fines, which are likely to eclipse those handed out for the manipulation of Libor over the last two years. State-backed RBS, which has set aside \u00a3400m to cover penalties for forex rigging in the UK and US, has refused say whether the bank\u2019s staff will bear the cost, through a cut in bonuses, or its shareholders. Discussions were expected to continue late into the night about the settlement, which the FCA is attempting to broker with the six leading players in the foreign exchange market. The regulator was aiming for a synchronised announcement involving the six banks in an attempt to avoid a re-run of the Libor scandal, where some banks are yet to be penalised \u2013 more than two years after Barclays was fined \u00a3290m by regulators in the US and UK. As well as RBS, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 which have together set aside more than \u00a31bn for potential fines \u2013 the FCA is also preparing penalties against US banks Citi and JP Morgan and the Swiss bank UBS. The Swiss bank is also facing punishment from its domestic regulators while the Wall Street Journal reported about 10 former and current employees had been warned of potential action by the Swiss regulator. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also facing a fine from the US regulators after taking a $400m (\u00a3250m) provision last week. The boards of the banks were said to be meeting on Tuesday night to ratify the settlements with the FCA \u2013 and there were some suggestions that the decision may not be taken until late in to the night meaning the announcement could be delayed. The fines from the FCA are expected to surpass the record \u00a3160m imposed on UBS over Libor in 2012. As a result of a change to the rules imposed after the Libor rigging scandal, all fines for \u201cmisconduct\u201d levied by the City regulator are handed to the Treasury rather than kept by the regulator. The FCA is allowed to keep enough cash to cover its costs. The Treasury did not comment last night when asked how it intended to use the proceeds from the latest fines, which will go into the \u201cconsolidated fund\u201d used for general purposes. It has in the past used fines from Libor rigging to make donations to armed forces charities and the emergency services.It is not yet clear what costs the FCA will have incurred during its investigation into currency manipulation which is thought to have focused on what is know as the 4pm \u201cfix\u201d - a benchmark used to price several currencies. The allegations focus on suggestions that traders could put in client orders during a 60 second trading window used to set the benchmark price.",

The ad will air for the first time during the prime-time Coronation Street slot on Friday evening and chief executive Dalton Philips said he was confident that the chain would beat its rivals on price for festive food and drink. The UK\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket chain announced in April it was cutting prices on 1,200 lines at a cost of \u00a31bn over three years, but needs a dramatic turnaround in it fortunes to avoid another disastrous Christmas like last year\u2019s, when it lost out to the discount retailers Aldi and Lidl.

To simplify its Christmas range, Morrisons has slashed lines by more than 10%, cutting back its range of Christmas puddings from 15 to 10 products, for example, and reduced other ranges where there is duplication. It has also tweaked its annual Christmas collector scheme, this year giving shoppers the chance to get \u00a325 off their Christmas shopping in just six weeks by collecting coupons after a minimum \u00a340 shop. Morrisons has run a Christmas Bonus scheme for seven years, and last year over 1.3m UK customers took part in it. Dalton Philips said this year\u2019s festive season would be the first bolstered by Morrisons\u2019 convenience shops, its recently launched Match &amp; More loyalty card and online shopping \u2013 still limited across the UK but extending in two weeks time into the north-west. Around 2m customers have signed up for the Match &amp; More card since its launch in October. Philips said: \u201cWe are keeping our prices very low and we are also making things easier and simpler for our shoppers, with an emphasis on the quality of our fresh food.\u201d To help achieve this, the grocer is appointing 1,800 new \u201cavailability\u201d champions \u2013 or a \u201cgap squad\u201d - in 300 stores to ensure items are quickly replenished on shelves, along with 1,000 \u201cfresh food inspectors\u201d to ensure that items such as sprouts are \u201csqueakily fresh\u201d.

Debenhams\u2019 profits also dipped by more than 20% during its last financial year.</p> <p>Sharp failed to hit many of his targets and was paid no cash bonus in 2014.

      "bodyText": "Michael Sharp, the chief executive of Debenhams, has enjoyed a 32% rise in his 2014 pay despite the continuing struggles at the department store. A three-year incentive plan boosted the retailing veteran\u2019s total package to \u00a3998,734 in the 12 months to August this year, from \u00a3754,396, even though the group\u2019s shares trailed those of similar sized companies during the life span of the scheme. Debenhams\u2019 profits also dipped by more than 20% during its last financial year. Sharp failed to hit many of his targets and was paid no cash bonus in 2014. He received only 22% of the maximum payout under the three-year incentive deal after Debenhams shares rose by around 20% over the period, compared with a 60% rise in the FTSE 250. The company said Sharp hit a target based on an accounting measure, return on capital employed. Last week the retailer announced that another incentive scheme was being established, under which Sharp could be awarded a maximum of 1.4m shares in the company, worth around \u00a3930,000 at current prices.

      "bodyText": "On a quiet day of trading - perhaps a relief after the volatility of recent weeks - European markets have mainly ended in positive territory, writes Nick Fletcher. Investors were mainly biding their time ahead of some key economic events later in the week, with the Bank of England\u2019s inflation report and UK unemployment data due on Wednesday, and eurozone GDP on Friday. Positive earnings results - notably from Vodafone - gave some support but Wall Street slipped back after its recent records by the time European markets closed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 16.15 points or 0.24% higher at 6627.40 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.18% to 9369.03 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.5% at 4244.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.02% to 19,255.47 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.64% at 10,338.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 6 points or 0.04%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. It may be Remembrance Day but it\u2019s also Singles Day, the biggest online retailing day in China. And it has been bigger than ever, as we report: Chinese online retailer Alibaba has already taken more than $9.3bn (\u00a35.85bn) in sales on Tuesday as Singles Day, the country\u2019s biggest online retail event, dwarfs other sales bonanzas around the world such as Black Friday in the US or Christmas in the UK. The live sales figure on Alibaba\u2019s giant screen at its sprawling Hangzhou campus surged past the 50bn yuan ($8.16bn) mark with two hours left to go, as Chinese and overseas shoppers snapped up heavily discounted items online. Full story here: Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day sale in China breaks online records One of the criticisms of the Royal Mail flotation was that there were some hidden jewels within the business, notably its property assets, which were being sold off on the cheap. And now the business has put up its Nine Elms site in London up for sale which analysts say could raise \u00a3662m, a hefty sum which may rekindle the sale controversy. Our full story is here: Royal Mail may reap \u00a3662m from planned sale of London sorting office The Dow Jones industrial average has nudged a new high at the start of trading on Wall Street. The Dow touched 17,624.37 in early deals, the latest in a string of records. Not the liveliest day so far, I\u2019m afraid. Here\u2019s a recap. Hundreds of payday lenders are expected to be driven out of business by new caps and charges announced by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority today. Under the FCA\u2019s new rules, lenders cannot charge more than 0.8% interest per day, or be paid back more than twice the loan amount. Details start here. FCA chief Martin Wheatley has predicted that only a few high-street lenders will continue in business once the proposals come into force in January. Industry expert Carl Packman agrees, telling Bloomberg that: \u201cYou will see providers voluntarily leave the market,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a consequence of tougher and better regulation.\u201d And consumer-credit provider Provident Financial has declared that it\u2019s ready to satisfy demand with its own loans (with an APR of 399%, or higher...) Chancellor George Osborne hailed the news that \u201cabsolutely outrageous fees and unacceptable practices\u201d are being dealt with. But Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the fight against payday lenders, warns that \u201clegal loan sharks\u201d are being let off too easily. She accused the FCA of being too lax: This year debt charities and the financial watchdog have reported rises in cases involving payday loans causing problems for consumers, showing just how toxic this industry is for many. Today\u2019s announcement means yet again these sharks have slipped through the net.\u201d In other news... Vodafone\u2019s shares have soared by 6.5% today, after raising its profit forecasts and reporting a smaller fall in sales than expected. But the mobile giant also reported double-digit sales declines in Spain and Italy in the last six months, as the weak European economy continues to hit demand. And the Russia remains under pressure - the ruble has fallen again today, and fashion chain New Look has revealed it is pulling out of the region. In other retail news, high street chain New Look announced today that it has pulled out of Russia and Ukraine due to the \u201cpolitical uncertainty\u201d in the region. Anders Kristiansen, chief executive of New Look, explained: \u201cAll retailers are having an extremely tough time in Russia, not just in clothing.\u201d The FT have more details. New Look said in August that it was considering its options in Russia - but such a bold move is a surprise. Kamel Mellahi, Professor of Strategic Management at Warwick Business School, is struck by how much has changed in a year. A year ago most key indicators were suggesting that New Look was going to escalate its commitment to the Russian market. Its operations were profitable and therefore it had sufficient financial slack to accelerate its international strategy. Also, Russia, among other emerging markets, was considered one of its key markets. Most observers were expecting it to increase the number of its stores in Russia. More importantly there were indicators that it was planning to deepen its commitment to the Russian market by buying out its franchise partner and move to a more committed mode of operation via a joint venture. Back in the UK, John Lewis has made a decent enough start to the festive trading period. The high street chain reported that sales rose 5% last week, with turnover rising to \u00a396m in the seven days to Saturday 8 November. More here. Retailers could use a good Christmas. Figures released overnight showed that sales of autumn clothing have been disappointing, due to the remarkably clement weather. Warm weather leaves UK retailers with piles of unwanted winter stock ....But, as this chart from the Economist shows, the benefits of the US recovery are not being shared fairly, at all. Finally, a gobbet of economic news. Just a small one -- American small business optimism rose in October. More owners said they planned to invest in their companies, and are finding it harder to find qualified applicant for new vacancies, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Its Small Business Optimism Index rose by 0.8 points to 96.1, suggesting the US economic recovery continued last month. It\u2019s an ill wind....The CEO of consumer-credit provider Provident Financial, Peter Crook, expects to benefit from the tight rules on payday loan firms. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThe FCA\u2019s own research predicts 99 percent of payday lenders will go out of business -- there are over 400 payday loan firms, there will be only four left,\u201d \u201cThat consumer demand to borrow money will still be there and we expect it to migrate to our loans.\u201d Provident offers loans on longer repayment terms than Wonga, but also imposes interest rates that are massively higher than more orthodox lending. It\u2019ll lend you \u00a3100 for 14 weeks, repayable at \u00a310 per week. An APR of 1,400%! That APR drops to mere triple digits if you borrow over a longer period... Back to the payday loan clampdown announced this morning. The most unscrupulous lenders will be driven out of business by the new caps on interest rates (0.8% per day), reckons Richard Scrivener, consultant at Bovill, the financial services regulatory consultancy. \u201cPayday lenders that have predicated their business model on the likelihood that a customer won\u2019t actually pay, allowing them to rack up punitive charges, are now going to find the going very tough.\u201d Scrivener also reckons that this will make space for international subprime lenders: \u201cLarger players are already adjusting their business models and the space cleared by the demise of some of the fringe players will create an attractive market.\u201d Over in Greece, the eKathimerini newspaper is reporting that Athens\u2019 government has been handed a list of targets by its troika of lenders. They say: Demands include covering a fiscal gap for 2015 that the troika puts at \u20ac2.6bn, reducing the number of instalments in which debtors can honour their dues, pushing through a second phase of pension reform and completing an overhaul of the tax administration system. The troika is also seeking the government\u2019s proposal for an across-the-board wage structure for public sector employees, plans for the restructuring of Greek public utility companies and legislation in view of the liberalization of the natural gas market. If Greece doesn\u2019t deliver these reforms within four weeks, eurozone finance ministers won\u2019t able to consider whether to provide a precautionary credit line to Greece, at their next Eurogroup meeting on 8th December. Eurozone expert Yannis Koutsomitis reckons prime minister Antonis Samaras will struggle to get these reforms though parliament, given his narrow majority. Back in the financial markets, the Russian ruble has had another bad morning, losing 1.8% against the US dollar. One dollar now buys 46.6 rubles, up from 45.8 last night. Yesterday, Russia\u2019s central bank gave up defending the currency, after spending tens of billions of dollars trying to keep the ruble within a trading corridor. Simon Baptist of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons the bank took a good decision. The ruble did rally yesterday, as the central bank also announced plans to limit domestic rouble liquidity - to prevent foreign speculation. But that rally has now reversed. The ruble has been sliding since the Ukraine crisis sparked tit-for-tat sanctions between Moscow, and Washington and Brussels. The falling oil price - which hit a new four-year low today - has also hit Russia. This chart suggests the ruble faces more pain. If payday lenders are driven out of business by today\u2019s caps, can more ethical lenders pick up the slack? The Labour party has warned that regulators must enforce the new cap on payday lending. Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour\u2019s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, has called for today\u2019s proposals to be reviewed by the end of 2015. She also pledged to hit the industry\u2019s profits if Labour win the next election. \u201cWe want to see more done to promote safer and more ethical forms of lending, and that is why a Labour Government would extend the levy on the profits of payday lenders and use the additional money raised to increase the level of Government funding for alternative credit providers such as credit unions.\u201d Back in the financial markets, and Vodafone has driven the European telecoms sector to its highest level since 2008. Vodafone\u2019s shares are now up 5.6%, on track for their best day this year, after beating revenue forecasts and nudging its profit estimates for this year. They\u2019re the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 today. Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says Vodafone is making progress in rolling out new services, such as 4G superfast mobile broadband. However, as flagged up in our opening post, Europe is a sore point.... Hunter says: The ferocity of competition shows no sign of relenting and there are pockets in Europe such as Germany, Italy and Spain where service revenues continue to decline quite steeply. Furthermore, net debt has shown an increase given the recent acquisition activity, whilst regulatory overhang and an uncertain European economic outlook provide further causes for concern. Payday lenders may vanish within year as result of today\u2019s price cap, one economist warned last night.... So how much of a difference will today\u2019s payday lenders cap make? An interest rate of 0.8% per day works out at \u00a324 interest on a \u00a3100 loan, after a month. Today, Wonga will charge you \u00a337.15 in interest if you borrow \u00a3100 for 30 days, so the FCA\u2019s rules will force that down, a little. And the proposal to prevent anyone having to repay more than double their loan does offer more protection. But some customers will be repeatedly borrowing, and repaying, money to and from loan companies over the course of a year. Financial journalist Paul Lewis has calculated that the annual percentage rate under the FCA\u2019s plans is still around 1,200%. Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, says payday lenders are still a major cause of financial angst: \u201cWe hope that these measures [details] will bring an end to the inappropriate lending that we have seen from this industry. However, the FCA will need to be vigilant to ensure that lenders do not simply change their business models to try to evade the rules. \u201cCalls to National Debtline about payday loans have actually declined slightly from their peak in 2013, but we are still seeing around one in 10 calls relating to this kind of borrowing. Fiona O\u2019Donnell, Labour MP for East Lothian, agrees that the payday lending cap isn\u2019t tight enough. Stella Creasy, who led the charge against the likes of Wonga, is not impressed by the FCA\u2019s new clampdown on payday lenders. The Walthamstow MP says a cap of 0.8% interest each day is simply too weak, and won\u2019t protect the public from \u2018legal loan sharking\u2019. Here\u2019s her official reaction: \u201cToday\u2019s news will be welcomed as an early Christmas present for Britain\u2019s legal loansharks. This cap is just \u00a31 lower than their current charges. This is an industry where some firms are making nearly three quarters of a million pounds a week from British customers- such a high cap will do little to tackle these rip off charges. \u201cWe\u2019ve warned regulators this cap needs to be much lower to really change the behaviour of these companies, but today\u2019s announcement shows they are still not listening. Other countries are much stronger at taking on these companies. Borrowers in countries like Japan, Australia, Canada and parts of America all have better protection from being preyed on by these companies, showing what can be done to end legal loan sharking. \u201cThis year debt charities and the financial watchdog have reported rises in cases involving payday loans causing problems for consumers, showing just how toxic this industry is for many. Today\u2019s announcement means yet again these sharks have slipped through the net.\u201d She\u2019d like you to spread the word.... UK chancellor George Osborne has welcomed the new caps and fees being imposed on payday lenders (details here), and condemned the way they operated in the past. In a statement, he says: The Financial Conduct Authority has now confirmed the cap on the total cost of payday loans \u2013 not just the interest rate, but also the arrangement fees as well as the penalty fees \u2013 that will come into force in the New Year. This is all part of our long term economic plan to have a banking system that works for hardworking people and make sure some of the absolutely outrageous fees and unacceptable practices are dealt with.\u201d We should remember, though, that it was opposition MPs such as Stella Creasy, Labour member for Walthamstow, who made payday lenders a hot political issue. The other big news this morning is that UK payday lenders are being hit with new restrictions on how much they can charge for their loans. The Financial Conduct Authority has declared that interest and fees will be capped at 0.8% a day, lowering the cost for most borrowers. This confirms a proposal made this summer. It\u2019s the latest stage in Britain\u2019s crackdown on payday lenders, which critics accuse of preying on vulnerable people who can\u2019t get an affordable loan from the banks. The total cost of a loan will be limited to 100% of the original sum, meaning borrowers won\u2019t be forced to pay more than double their loan. And default fees will be capped at \u00a315. Martin Wheatley, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, says the new rules \u201cstrike the right balance for firms and consumers\u201d. He argues: If the price cap was any lower, then we risk not having a viable market, any higher and there would not be adequate protection for borrowers. For people who struggle to repay, we believe the new rules will put an end to spiralling payday debts. For most of the borrowers who do pay back their loans on time, the cap on fees and charges represents substantial protections.\u201d Here\u2019s our full story, which will be updated through the day: FCA\u2019s new payday loan caps set for January 2015 Shares in Vodafone have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading, up 9p to 216.9p. Investors appreciate the news that it has raised its profit forecasts. They had also been braced for a 2.8% drop in organic service revenue; Vodafone actually reported a 1.5% decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Vodafone has got the morning rolling with a reminder that Europe\u2019s weaker countries remain a tough place to operate. But the mobile giant has also cheered the City by raising its profit forecasts; good news for millions of small shareholders. In its latest financial results, Vodafone reports that it suffered \u201ccontinued revenue declines in Europe\u201d, particularly in areas hit hard by the eurozone crisis. Service revenue across Europe fell by 7.1% in the six months to the end of September. That included a 13% in service revenues in Italy in the first half of the year, and 12.4% in Spain -- where underlying profits slumped by over 40%. Here\u2019s the key details: Vodafone blamed \u201congoing pressures from competition, regulation and weak economies\u201d in Europe. There are signs that the slump may be bottoming out -- revenues in the last three months were \u2018only\u2019 down by 9.7% in Italy, and by 9.3% in Spain. Chief executive Vittorio Colao claims that conditions are improving: \u201cWe have made encouraging progress during the quarter. There is growing evidence of stabilisation in a number of our European markets, supported by improvements in our commercial execution and very strong demand for data. And Vodafone has raised its forecast for underlying earnings this year, to between \u00a311.6bn and \u00a311.9bn, from \u00a311.4bn-\u00a311.9bn previously. But still, the situation in Southern Europe remains concerning, as Bloomberg\u2019s Jonathan Ferro explains. More to follow....",

United Utilities was in the spotlight, up 19.5p to 883p, valuing it at around \u00a36bn, on renewed talk of possible bid interest from Canada\u2019s Ontario Teachers Pension Fund or perhaps Kuwaiti investors, with a price of up to \u00a312 a share mentioned. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 16.15 points better at 6627.40 amid fairly low volumes and ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Bank of England quarterly inflation report and UK unemployment and wage figures.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chinese online retailer Alibaba has already taken more than $9.3bn (\u00a35.85bn) in sales on Tuesday as Singles Day, the country\u2019s biggest online retail event, dwarfs other sales bonanzas around the world such as Black Friday in the US or Christmas in the UK. The live sales figure on Alibaba\u2019s giant screen at its sprawling Hangzhou campus surged past the 57.1bn yuan ($8.16bn) mark with two hours left to go, as Chinese and overseas shoppers snapped up heavily discounted items online. The company, which floated in New York at $25bn just eight weeks ago, easily smashed its sales record of $5.8bn last year. Alibaba said it had taken just 20 minutes to reach $1bn in sales \u2013 compared to an hour last year. The company started marketing the 11 November Singles\u2019 Day event \u2013 the Chinese reaction to Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 in 2009, turning it into an online shopping bonanza over the years as rival online stores offer discounts lasting a week or more. Joe Tsai, Alibaba Group\u2019s executive vice-chairman, said: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer. We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy \u2013 from focused on the state sector to consumption.\u201d Last year, Alibaba\u2019s websites and other Chinese online retailers together sold about $9.3bn worth of goods on Singles Day \u2013 about 10 times more than on a typical shopping day in the country and nearly five times the amount sold in the US on Cyber Monday \u2013 the Monday following Thanksgiving and the world\u2019s second largest online sales event. By comparison, US retailers took $1.2bn on Black Friday (the Friday following Thanksgiving), and $1.7bn on Cyber Monday last year via the internet, according to Comscore. The nearest equivalent in the UK is Christmas, with \u00a311bn spent online over the whole of December. Last year, Black Friday made its breakthrough in the UK and sales are expected to expand again this year and become one of the UK\u2019s most important shopping days, alongside Easter and Boxing Day. Big discounts on Alibaba\u2019s websites including Tmall and Taobao Marketplace have turned an obscure Chinese holiday into a phenomenon that the recently listed retailer wants to export worldwide. The company said most overseas buyers on its websites hailed from Hong Kong, the US and Taiwan. However, the date, which coincides with armistice day when Europe remembers its war dead, means the day is unlikely to take off here. Singles Day in China was invented by students in the 1990s as Bachelors\u2019 Day \u2013 a day to meet prospective partners and hang out with single friends eating deep-fried dough sticks representing the four ones in 11.11 or steamed buns which represent the dot. It was chosen because of the many 1s in the date resemble \u201cbare branches\u201d, the Chinese expression for bachelors and spinsters. Alibaba copyrighted the \u201cDouble 11\u201d term in 2012. Jeff Walters, partner at The Boston Consulting Group in Hong Kong, said clothing was the main item sold last year while food, including nuts, have been one of this year\u2019s hot sellers. Walters said research suggested individual shoppers planned to spend around 15% less on Singles Day this year than last, but as the total number of shoppers had increased by 20% to about 360 million, Singles\u2019 Day would still be the biggest online sales event ever. But he added a note of caution, saying: \u201cPromotions are becoming more common throughout the year, making Singles Day less \u2018special\u2019\u201d.",

Nine Elms is one of three former mail centres expected to be turned into luxury flats, with the total value of the portfolio estimated at more than \u00a31bn by analysts. The other two are Mount Pleasant, at Farringdon, central London, and a one-acre plot next to Paddington station, which was sold last month for \u00a3111m, with additional proceeds if the site is sold on soon or the developer gets further planning permission. Nine Elms, a 14-acre site (5.6 hectares), is close to Battersea Power station in south-west London, an area considered a property hotspot \u2013 the power station is being converted by its Malaysian developers into luxury homes, designed by Frank Gehry and Sir Norman Foster, while the US embassy is relocating to the area from Grosvenor Square in Mayfair. Two-bed flats in the power station redevelopment have gone on sale for more than \u00a31.5m, three-beds for more than \u00a32.7m and four-beds for at least \u00a34m. Royal Mail said it would make a decision on the Nine Elms site, which was closed in 2012, once it has reviewed all options, which include a sale or developing it with a partner. It won planning consent from Wandsworth council in March 2012 to create up to 1,870 homes, more than six acres of public space, 1.2 acres of community and retail space, as well as a new primary school. The ratio of homes classified as affordable housing is 15%. Analysts at Berenberg have valued Nine Elms at \u00a3662m. In one of the most controversial privatisations in UK history, the Royal Mail was floated at \u00a33.3bn in autumn 2013. The National Audit Office judged that the sale had shortchanged taxpayers by at least \u00a3750m. Royal Mail\u2019s former central London sorting office at Paddington was sold to a Singaporean consortium, Great Western Developments, the first property sale since the privatisation. Royal Mail vacated the site in 2008 and received planning permission in 2012 to convert the building into 128 flats and an eight-storey office building with shops and restaurants on the ground floor. Martin Gafsen, group property director at the Royal Mail Group, said: \u201cNine Elms is a key area of regeneration in London and we look forward to our former mail centre site being part of a thriving, revitalised area.\u201d The site is being marketed by Savills and Rothschild. Last month, Royal Mail won approval to build 681 homes on part of its Mount Pleasant sorting office, with the London mayor overriding criticism that there was a lack of affordable housing \u2013 the scheme includes two-bed flats which will cost up to \u00a31,690 a month to rent. The Mount Pleasant scheme alone could be worth up to \u00a31bn. Royal Mail has been criticised in the past for not collecting the full value of its property assets. A 2.3-acre Post Office site on Rathbone Place, just off Oxford Street, central London, which sold for \u00a3120m to Great Portland Estates in 2011, has been valued at \u00a3550m upon completion.",

The admission was made as the bank\u2019s top management team began three days of presentations to investors, who have endured a 30% drop in share values. There are also concerns about whether the bank has enough capital. At the start of the three-day presentation, the new finance director, Andy Halford, said: \u201cWe recognise our recent performance has been disappointing and are determined to get back on to a trajectory of sustainable, profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital.\u201d Halford, a former telecoms executive who joined the bank only five months ago, said Standard Chartered had \u201cenormous advantages\u201d but had \u201crefreshed and sharpened our strategy\u201d as a result of market changes. According to slides published on the bank\u2019s website, Halford kicked off the presentations in Hong Kong. The chief executive, Peter Sands \u2013 one of the few bank bosses to survive the banking crisis \u2013 is not due to make a presentation to investors until Thursday, which could determine his future at the bank. There was no mention of any presentations by the bank\u2019s chairman, Sir John Peace, who also chairs the retailer Burberry and who is also facing scrutiny from Standard Chartered investors. Peace is not thought to have made presentations at previous investor meetings. The slides posted to accompany Halford\u2019s presentation show that he addressed concerns about \u201ccapital accretion\u201d and whether the management has taken tough enough action to stem the slide in performance at Standard Chartered, which until last year had produced 10 years of successive profits growth. In the last 12 months there have been three warnings about profits; the most recent being last month. Presentations by Halfords\u2019 colleagues showed that the bank would cut up to 100 branches from the current 1,248-branch network next year. While Standard Chartered does not have a presence on UK high streets it is a familiar sight on streets across the emerging markets. Sands has insisted that the bank does not need additional capital at a time when its growth is slowing and it is facing rising bad debt charges in some of its markets. The bank may also face fresh fines from the US authorities, which have reopened inquiries into breaches of sanctions with Iran, which cost the bank \u00a3415m in 2012. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said he was \u201cinclined to side with management\u201d on the issue of capital. \u201cTo our minds the market appears to be wrongly obsessed with the lack of progression about the [capital] ratio,\u201d Greenwood said, pointing to the size of the bank\u2019s leverage ratio, another measure of financial strength.",

      "body": "<p>Every so often there\u2019s an investor who has staying power\u2013 people like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch at Fidelity, whose track records remain strong for decades. Bill Miller, the chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, seemed like one of those people.</p> <p>His investments beat the market every year for15 years straight. <br></p> <p>But Miller\u2019s fortunes turned when the recession came. He bet big on housing and Bear Stearns. In 2008 his fund went from best performing to one of the worse performing in its class. The fall was complete. Bill Miller, once a star, had failed. <br></p> <p>Except, that by 2012, Miller had righted himself. His fund was once again the best performing in its class: the king of mutual funds was back, declared the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p>Miller\u2019s life hasbeen a lesson for anyone with investments. The stories that dominate coverage are the great trades, the comebacks, the big wins that they focus on. <br></p> <p>Here\u2019s the real story of the markets: we all love a success story, but the real story is in the failures. <br></p> <p>Failure is a test of resilience, which is the No1 quality required for successful investing. <br></p> <p>Professional stock investing, with its sharp ups and downs, can teach us a lot about life. Money brings out the insecurity, fear and irrationality that we might otherwise keep hidden in polite society. Investing isn\u2019t just a test of strategy\u2013 it\u2019s a test of character, and what we do when investing is very often what we believe about ourselves. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79b48ef41ec5e5b690fc05783d43a6371b01b897\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415654970980/ba7483eb-4429-42d9-97c6-639503f5014b-460x310.jpeg\" alt=\"mirror\" width=\"460\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Indian investor is reflected on his motorcycle rear-view mirror as he watches the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Research has shown that negative emotions are<a href=\"http://www.carlsonmba.umn.edu/Assets/71516.pdf\"> handled differently</a> by the brain. Negative emotions involve more thinking, and we remember them in greater detail, than the positive ones. <br></p> <p>In a study that demonstrates the emotions of stock traders, researchers<a href=\"http://course.sdu.edu.cn/G2S/eWebEditor/uploadfile/20130802133522613.pdf\"> Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky</a> looked at what happens to emotion when people lose or gain money. The result: people were more distressed by losing money than they were made happy by gaining it.</p> <p>Once confidence is gone, it starts to \u201cmanifests in long slumps and even depression\u201d, says Dr Alden Cass, a therapist who sees many Wall Street traders in his practice, and who wrote on the subject in his book, Bullish Thinking: The Advisor\u2019s Guide to Surviving and Thriving on Wall Street.</p> <p>But then there are people like Donald Trump, who, despite many advantages, has had repeat ventures fail, filing for bankruptcy for various businesses four times. However, he kept trying, until he finally hit upon his most marketable asset: Donald Trump the personality. Making himself the product, Trump could finally say he succeeded at business.</p> <p>Just like there are two sides to any story, there are two sides to any setback.</p> <p>According to the research of psychologist Carol Dweck, how we handle setbacks comes down to how we attribute failure. In an<a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1975-32626-001\"> elegant experiment</a> in 1975, Dweck took a group of school kids who had been identified by their teachers as helpless when it comes to math. <br></p> <p>She divided the kids into two groups. One group of kids were repeatedly told that the reason they could not solve the problem was because they had not worked at it hard enough, and if they just kept going they would get there. Those kids started to improve, and solve problems they had never previously been able to master. <br></p> <p>The control group of kids, on the other hand, continued to struggle and give up after getting to the hard problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfde271102688861056e344e4ba6cb6e097d17b4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415651177379/466682c1-a41b-44a1-a6a8-4be03d39ea0d-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"business\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worried that your retirement funds are shrinking?

Thompson worked for his father for 16 years, investing in equity and bond mutual funds.

      "bodyText": "Every so often there\u2019s an investor who has staying power\u2013 people like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch at Fidelity, whose track records remain strong for decades. Bill Miller, the chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, seemed like one of those people. His investments beat the market every year for15 years straight. But Miller\u2019s fortunes turned when the recession came. He bet big on housing and Bear Stearns. In 2008 his fund went from best performing to one of the worse performing in its class. The fall was complete. Bill Miller, once a star, had failed. Except, that by 2012, Miller had righted himself. His fund was once again the best performing in its class: the king of mutual funds was back, declared the Wall Street Journal. Miller\u2019s life hasbeen a lesson for anyone with investments. The stories that dominate coverage are the great trades, the comebacks, the big wins that they focus on. Here\u2019s the real story of the markets: we all love a success story, but the real story is in the failures. Failure is a test of resilience, which is the No1 quality required for successful investing. Professional stock investing, with its sharp ups and downs, can teach us a lot about life. Money brings out the insecurity, fear and irrationality that we might otherwise keep hidden in polite society. Investing isn\u2019t just a test of strategy\u2013 it\u2019s a test of character, and what we do when investing is very often what we believe about ourselves. Focusing on the negative For instance, we are predisposed to focus more on the negative. Research has shown that negative emotions are handled differently by the brain. Negative emotions involve more thinking, and we remember them in greater detail, than the positive ones. In a study that demonstrates the emotions of stock traders, researchers Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky looked at what happens to emotion when people lose or gain money. The result: people were more distressed by losing money than they were made happy by gaining it. Once confidence is gone, it starts to \u201cmanifests in long slumps and even depression\u201d, says Dr Alden Cass, a therapist who sees many Wall Street traders in his practice, and who wrote on the subject in his book, Bullish Thinking: The Advisor\u2019s Guide to Surviving and Thriving on Wall Street. But then there are people like Donald Trump, who, despite many advantages, has had repeat ventures fail, filing for bankruptcy for various businesses four times. However, he kept trying, until he finally hit upon his most marketable asset: Donald Trump the personality. Making himself the product, Trump could finally say he succeeded at business. Just like there are two sides to any story, there are two sides to any setback. According to the research of psychologist Carol Dweck, how we handle setbacks comes down to how we attribute failure. In an elegant experiment in 1975, Dweck took a group of school kids who had been identified by their teachers as helpless when it comes to math. She divided the kids into two groups. One group of kids were repeatedly told that the reason they could not solve the problem was because they had not worked at it hard enough, and if they just kept going they would get there. Those kids started to improve, and solve problems they had never previously been able to master. The control group of kids, on the other hand, continued to struggle and give up after getting to the hard problems. Fear John C Thompson, chief investment officer at Vilas Capital Management, has lived this dynamic. Thompson worked for his father for 16 years, investing in equity and bond mutual funds. He eventually made the cover of Barron\u2019s \u2013 the pinnacle of public recognition for investors. But the \u201creality of the business\u201d caught up with him. In 2008, his investments in value stocks\u2013 including financial services\u2013 were \u201cslaughtered\u201d, he says. His returns suffered, but Thompson felt that his investing philosophy was still sound. He was willing to take the hit and keep working till he got back to his high returns. But his father \u201ccould not handle being wrong,\u201d and told him to invest in index funds or leave the firm. The reproach felt like a failure. \u201cI had the rug pulled out from underneath me,\u201d said Thompson. Index funds do nothing more than track the market, and they don\u2019t require any investing brains to work. These days Thompson runs his own fund, outperforming the market, continuing the investment philosophy he developed when growing his father\u2019s fund. His father continues to invest in index funds since the 2008 crisis\u2013 getting lower returns than Thompson\u2019s Vilas Capital Management, according to Thompson. Success is mine, failure is an accident When people get frustrated, emotional and react to market events, \u201cit bites them in the rear,\u201d says James Scheinberg, founder and chief investment officer of North Pier Fiduciary Management, who has worked for over 20 years evaluating portfolio managers.

We think TalkTalk will struggle to (i) cut churn to 0.8%-1.2% in a few years; (ii) keep raising prices without also having to spend significantly to add commensurate value.

TalkTalk still expects to deliver growth in the pre-SAC EBITDA, but higher volumes are likely to lead to \u00a320m to \u00a325m of SAC investment more than the company had previously envisaged when it gave its 16% to 17% margin target. This is also likely to undermine confidence in the medium-term target of 25% which, in our view, was already weak.TalkTalk has however reiterated its intention to grow the dividend by 15% despite the likely pressure on cash flow expectations.</p> </blockquote>",

We think TalkTalk will struggle to (i) cut churn to 0.8%-1.2% in a few years; (ii) keep raising prices without also having to spend significantly to add commensurate value. Also, we believe there are many reasons why TalkTalk is not a take-over target for, say, Vodafone or BSkyB. BESI Research said: Revenue guidance for growth of 4% for the full year has been maintained but EBITDA guidance has been cut. TalkTalk still expects to deliver growth in the pre-SAC EBITDA, but higher volumes are likely to lead to \u00a320m to \u00a325m of SAC investment more than the company had previously envisaged when it gave its 16% to 17% margin target. This is also likely to undermine confidence in the medium-term target of 25% which, in our view, was already weak.TalkTalk has however reiterated its intention to grow the dividend by 15% despite the likely pressure on cash flow expectations.",

      "bodyText": "Profits from running Australia\u2019s immigration detention centres have been substantially propping up the finances of UK outsourcing company Serco, which is facing increased losses from other contracts it holds. Shares in Serco collapsed by a third after an announcement released on Tuesday revealed concerns about the profitability of the company. But the announcement also revealed that the massive contract to run Australia\u2019s onshore immigration detention centres, which is valued at almost $3bn, was insulating the company from \u201cstrategic missteps\u201d it had made in other dealings. \u201cThe financial impact of these missteps has been mitigated to a significant degree in recent years by the rapid growth of the Australian immigration services contract. Between 2009 and 2013, group adjusted operating profit grew by 28%; excluding the immigration services contract, group profits were flat,\u201d Serco said. The release goes on to note that the contract \u201chas begun to decline significantly in value\u201d, which has given a clearer indication of the underlying business trends. Serco also revealed that Australia\u2019s fleet of Armidale class patrol vessels \u2013 used to intercept and more recently turn back asylum seeker vessels \u2013 are in dire condition, and are likely to require \u201cintensive care\u201d for the rest of their active lives until 2022. The company\u2019s contract with the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) for the maintenance of the Armidale patrol vessels has been a substantial \u201ccontractual issue\u201d, which has been a factor in its poor outlooks. The release indicates the damage to the vessels is far worse than has previously been acknowledged, leading to a major revision in cost estimates that could lead to an adjustment of $275m. \u201cIt is now apparent that there are major design flaws with the class of vessel, and a number of different issues related to design, manufacture, usage and maintenance practice have conspired to require maintenance expenditure far in excess of that envisaged at the time the vessels first began service in 2005,\u201d the Serco statement said. \u201cUntil very recently, it was believed that these issues could be fixed as part of a one-off maintenance cycle. However, an engineering re-assessment of likely costs to complete now leads us to conclude that this class of boat is going to need intensive care (far beyond that expected a few months ago) for the rest of its life.\u201d The defence minister, David Johnston, had earlier defended the vessels and said they had an \u201cenormous output and work rate\u201d. Former defence department secretary Paul Barratt said it was likely the way the vessels were used in asylum seeker operations had contributed to their deterioration. \u201cI suspect part of the story is these boats are being used more intensively and in more extreme ways than was envisioned,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time these boats were purchased nobody would have envisioned the sort of asylum seeker regime we\u2019ve got now.\u201d The Defence Department has been contacted for comment. Separately, the office of the Australian information commissioner released a decision on Tuesday compelling the Immigration Department to release documents about the financial penalties incurred by Serco. The landmark decision by privacy commissioner Timothy Pilgrim could mean that documents relating to the costs incurred in detention centres may be more freely accessible. \u201cThe welfare of detainees and the provision of adequate services within the Australian detention centre network is currently a matter of significant public scrutiny and debate,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cI believe that the Australian public have a right to know how the operators of these centres are performing with respect to the contracted KPIs and what penalties are being imposed on them when they fail to meet those KPIs.\u201d The immigration minister, Scott Morrison, also announced on Tuesday that a new advisory group will be created to monitor the onshore and offshore immigration detention centres and private contractors . \u201cThe Detention Assurance Team will monitor the effectiveness of the high standards in place for detention service providers including, where necessary and appropriate, recommending action to deal with credible allegations of misconduct should they arise,\u201d he said.",
