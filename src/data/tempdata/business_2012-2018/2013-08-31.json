      "bodyText": "A feelgood recovery is said to be under way. There is a modest fall in unemployment and an improvement in the housing market. According to Nick Moon of GfK, the company which runs the European Union's consumer confidence barometer, Britain's consumers were more optimistic in August than at any time since October 2009. However, a paradox is in play. \"As more and more official figures show that living standards are at their lowest for a decade,\" Moon said last week, \"the public's economic confidence continues to grow strongly, a conundrum of Alice in Wonderland proportions.\" On Wednesday, claims of a nascent recovery will be further challenged by Low Pay Britain 2013, a report by the thinktank the Resolution Foundation. It reveals that, instead of boats rising as the economic tide turns, many threaten to become permanently beached due to the profound imbalance in the economy that even sustained growth won't fix. The report flags up a \"two-tier\" workforce in which, in the second division, millions of people, especially women, young people under 30 and those outside London, regardless of skills and qualifications, are stuck in \"feel-bad\", low-paid, part-time and temporary jobs, excluded from home ownership, career advancement and income security. In the top tier are those in managerial and professional jobs (finance, law, medicine, media and big business), a metropolitan elite who, throughout the recession and before, have accrued an ever expanding share of the national cake. Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who will speak at the report's launch, says: \"If the recovery continues, there are signs that it will be a recovery that is not for the many but for the few at the top. We need to take action to make sure we have a more broadly based economy.\" Low pay is defined as two-thirds of gross hourly median pay, set at \u00a37.44 an hour in 2012 (\u00a313,620 compared with the median salary of \u00a321,583). One in three of those aged 16 to 30 are now low-paid, compared with one in five in the 1970s. Five million of the workforce are low-paid, three million of whom are female. In 1975 part-time workers made up just 30% of the low-paid population (1.1 million); that has doubled to 58% (2.9 million). The share of low-paid workers in temporary employment has increased from 8% in 2000 to 13% in 2012. More than six million are in search of more paid employment while, since 2009, the number of self-employed people has risen by 400,000 to 4.2 million as their average rates of pay have collapsed from \u00a316,000 in 2002 to \u00a311,900 by 2011. Self-employment provides one escape from dead-end jobs, but carries its own risks. Badda Ranjit-Burma, 24, lives on \u00a375 a fortnight jobseekers' allowance, out of which he pays support for his three-year-old daughter and repays a crisis loan. He is a volunteer for a charity and is setting up his own music production company with the help of a Liverpool social enterprise, Local Solutions. \"Young people need work that gives them meaning,\" he says. \"A job isn't just about pride and income. It's also about dignity and hope.\" \"What we are seeing is counter-indicative to the message that if working families strive they will be fine,\" says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \"Forty per cent of those whom we see in real difficulties are employed. The cost of living is rising, almost half have no savings, and they are finding it impossible to manage. The welfare state is facing cuts while the minimum wage is supposed to enable an average person to survive, but it's now accepted, in certain industries such as hospitality, that an employer no longer has to pay a wage on which people can live. For many families, this does not feel like any kind of economic recovery.\" Wages for all but the top 10% have flatlined for several years. Household incomes were initially boosted by easy credit, women going into work, savings and tax credits subsidising low-pay employers. Now, according to the Resolution Foundation, cuts to benefits and a significant rise in the cost of living mean that, by 2020, some households will have an income 20% lower than an equivalent household in 2008. Families are already pushed to the brink. Carol and her husband Pete have two children and live in Newcastle. He earned well as a builder, Carol worked 16 hours a week on a minimum wage (\u00a36.19 an hour) in retail and looked after their two children. Then Peter developed back problems and is undergoing a series of operations, so he cannot work. Carol's employers were unable to increase her hours from 16 to 24 when the benefits system changed, so \u00a3250 a month has been cut from the family's working tax credit. The couple's son and daughter are under 10 and each has a bedroom. As a result, the family has to pay another \u00a350 a month because of the bedroom tax. They also have debts from credit cards when life was better. \"Often we are left with \u00a320 a week to get by,\" Carol says. \"We are not alone. There are thousands like us. And I don't see how it can get better.\" Economists such as Stewart Lansley argue that rebalancing the economy away from the dominance of the financial sector, shifting a larger slice from profits to wages, creating more apprenticeships, higher-skill, higher-paid jobs, and reducing tax credits by encouraging the adoption of the voluntary Living Wage (\u00a38.55 in London, \u00a37.45 outside) and a higher minimum wage could contribute to sounder economic growth and a fairer share of the rewards. The alternative is that a \"cost of living\" election in 2015 may produce, from all but the few, a very negative response to the question: \"Are you better off?\"",

      "bodyText": "In Streatham, south London, builders are hard at work addressing the capital's dire housing shortage on a site next to the suburb's railway station. Their employer, however, is not a housebuilder such as Bovis or Barratt but Britain's biggest supermarket: Tesco. Bustling about in hard hats and fluorescent jackets, they are putting the finishing touches to a 60,000 sq ft Tesco store and 250 apartments that sit above, behind and beside it. Living above the shop is very much back in fashion as supermarkets lead the development of thousands of homes in their latest tactic to secure new sites. As a consequence, the race for market share among the UK's largest retailers is inadvertently helping London chip away at a housing shortfall that equates to at least 32,000 new homes per year. Tesco alone is building more than 800 homes in London in 2013, close to 5% of all the non-local authority homes being built in the capital. Its huge projects in Woolwich, Highams Green and Streatham are merely paving the way for a wave of supermarket-led home building projects which will flood across the south-east. More than 4,500 homes are being planned by the big five grocers in London alone over the coming years, according to property advisor CBRE, while construction market analyst Glenigan estimates supermarkets will be laying the foundations for more than 2,100 homes in 2014. Sainsbury's is likely to be responsible for the bulk of those, as it begins projects involving more than 1,500 homes next year. But Morrisons has planning permission for nearly 400 homes, while Asda is already involved in the building of 100 above its new store in Barking. Even Waitrose and Lidl are getting in on the act. In the last couple of years, the big five seem to have woken up to the idea of developing homes alongside their retail portfolios, says Robert Davis, research director of Glenigan. He estimates that between them Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Asda and Morrisons completed just 267 units in 2012, but that this will soar to more than 1,000 this year and double again next year. Some of these projects were first dreamt up nearly a decade ago but the complexity of gaining planning permission and assembling the sites mean that they are only now coming to fruition. Helped by an upturn in the housing market, some enormous development projects are about to hit the street, such as Sainsbury's partnership with Barratt to redevelop the site of its supermarket in Nine Elms, in south London, involving nearly 700 homes, an 80,000 sq ft shop and a tube station. But supermarkets are also involved in small-scale urban developments, such as transforming moribund pubs into local convenience stores with a few flats above. Most of these projects are in London, partly because that's where there is demand for the kind of flats easily built above a shop. Building over a busy supermarket is also relatively expensive, so such pricey apartments are more likely to find buyers in places like London where house prices are recovering rapidly. But supermarkets have also been pushed into building in the capital because of planning guidance which encourages all new retail developments to include a residential element unless there is a very good reason not to do so. \"There is a massive shortage of housing in London. Planners saw supermarkets wanted to grow and they are capitalising on that to force them to help solve the problem,\" says CBRE's John Witherell. Local authorities outside London are also looking how they can capitalise on the trend. But Witherell believes these building schemes are more difficult to get off the ground outside the south-east because of lack of demand and the relatively high cost of such homes.Sainsbury's completed a development involving 100 homes in Leek, Staffordshire, this year and Tesco recently completed student accommodation block in Gateshead with nearly 1,000 bedrooms, but such projects, so far at least, have proved more rare. Supermarkets are looking at a variety of solutions to make above-store building more cost effective, including putting pre-fabricated structures on top of existing shops, according to Witherell. Kathy MacEwen, head of programmes for Cabe, says: \"There are many benefits to mixing supermarkets and housing. It makes more efficient use of land, while having residents supports activity and natural surveillance of streets, particularly when the store is closed.\" Yet some concerns have been raised about the design and quality of the housing supermarkets are building, given the main purpose of the development is usually to open a new store. Is it really wise to hand over the development of whole urban communities to the supermarkets? MacEwen says careful design is needed to avoid noise, smells and the sight of unattractive activities like waste storage and removal, deliveries and everyday operations. But Witherell and Peter Sloane at property company Savills, who is leading sales at Tesco's Woolwich site, says the flats are selling well, which has boosted the prospects for more schemes. Tesco says it is in its interests to build quality homes which are popular with tenants. \"After building we remain the main tenant and occupier for years, so we have an added incentive to make sure these are developments of the highest quality. They need to last and be great places to live, work and shop,\" a spokesman says. With many more supermarket-backed homes appearing in the next few years, retailers will have to deliver the goods.",

    "webTitle": "China's quest for world-beating brand held back by regime", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China is the world's second-largest economy but it has yet to develop the breakthrough global brand that will consolidate its status as a true commercial superpower. The names of Chery, Xiaomi and Baidu are synonymous with cars, mobile phones and internet search in China but they do not resonate abroad in the way that Ford, Samsung and Google straddle the globe. Likewise, there is no Chinese equivalent of Sony, Boeing or Coca-Cola, despite the ambition of the political hierarchy to convert a nation of 1.3bn people into a consumption-driven juggernaut. That lack of a worldwide champion means that Made in China lacks prestige as a label, despite the country's importance as the world's factory floor, making everything from iPads to Topshop garments. And that reputation as a global manufacturing hub is one of the problems, nurturing a perception that China is synonymous with cheap, low-quality goods. Newspaper headlines in the west declaim stories about China's toxic baby milk, lead-contaminated toys and fake pharmaceuticals. But this is changing, as China's leaders force that economic shift from export-based growth to consumer spending. They are pumping money into research and development so that Chinese brands can compete with foreign rivals in a burgeoning domestic market. Furthermore, many of these companies have taken that baton and are running towards foreign markets, with the hope that global success will result. Much of the push comes in the form of state subsidies \u2013 according to the state-run China Daily newspaper, the country spent \u00a3105bn on research and development last year. A number of Chinese companies have delivered high-quality products abroad, mainly through combining with other international conglomerates. For example, computer maker Lenovo bought IBM's PC division in 2005 and five years later Geely Automobile bought Volvo from Ford. But analysts say China's quest to deliver a global brand, while fuelled by an abundance of cash and ambition, may face insurmountable obstacles such as a rigid corporate culture and a top-down approach to innovation. The draconian education system encourages rote memorisation over creativity, while its political system discourages risk-taking and going against the grain. \"There's a conflict of interest that China has \u2013 one which supports as well as deters innovation \u2013 and that is central government control,\" says Bill Dodson, the Shanghai-based author of China Fast Forward: The Technologies, Green Industries and Innovations Driving the Mainland's Future. He adds: \"China says OK, we're going to identify 20 companies to go out and become global brand champions, and we're going to give them whatever money and resources they need to do that. But if the companies become too big for their britches, or snap back at central government, or become too autonomous, there's a reining in.\" Analysts point to Japan and South Korea's success in developing global brands as evidence that China could soon follow. Before the 1980s, Japan's manufacturing base endured the same derision as China's, but that was before brands such as Sony, Nissan, Toyota and Honda established themselves globally. South Korea's capital, Seoul, was once reliant on foreign aid to overcome the devastation of the Korean war. It is now one of the world's most technologically advanced urban centres. Samsung, founded more than 70 years ago as a trading company, is now one of South Korea's two most successful conglomerates. Its subsidiaries deal in everything from theme parks to life insurance. Taken as a whole, it produces a fifth of the country's global exports. Its other global superpower, Hyundai, was founded in 1947 as a construction firm and began exporting cars to the US in the 1980s. This month, it unveiled a \u00a331,000 concept car, the HCD-14 Genesis, which it hopes will take on the world's top brands. Among China's biggest hopes for a global breakthrough is car maker Chery, founded in 1997. Its most popular model is the QQ City Car, a pod-like hatchback that seems ubiquitous among China's middle-class families. The company has established joint ventures with a number of foreign brands, including Jaguar Land Rover and in 2011 it exported around a quarter of its production total. Yet Chery has yet to create an image that will turn heads in New York and London. \"While Chery is enhancing its hard power actively, it also pays close attention to fostering soft power,\" boasts the company's English website, taking a cue from the country's diplomatic rhetoric. \"With vigorous culture of innovation, Chery has realised the great-leap-forward development and has received deep concern and great attention from the leaders of the country and the Party.\" Sceptics say that Chinese brands like Chery will never surpass foreign rivals unless they can embrace fundamental principles of innovation \u2013 open communication, risk-taking \u2013 that require more than cash. This extends to creative industries, such as music, film, and fashion. \"We get these endless things from the government saying there should be more innovation and brand building,\" says Paul French, chief China market strategist at market research firm Mintel. \"But there isn't anything behind it. The problem is that no one really wants to invest in innovative design. It's very market-led. So if reports come to the stores that red shirts are selling, they'll tell their in-house designers to design more red shirts. This means the designers don't get a chance to do anything.\" \"I don't think anyone in government understands creative industries,\" French adds. \"They spent 60 years driving creativity out of the system. To reintroduce it in 10 minutes is a bit hopeful.\" Chinese companies are trying to buck that trend. For instance, Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, headquartered in Shenzhen, has more than 140,000 employees, nearly half of whom work in R&amp;D. The company applied for 54,000 patents in 2012, 14,000 of them outside China. However, Chinese technology upstarts will struggle to make inroads into western markets, judging by Huawei's sometimes faltering progress, because of the political problems they face. Huawei has been barred from operating in the US because of security concerns and its UK operations are the subject of a review by Britain's national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch. Robin Li, boss of Baidu, China's leading search engine, announced a plan to crack the Japanese market in 2007. Last year, when diplomatic tempers flared amid a territorial dispute over a series of islands in the resource-rich East China Sea, Baidu's main page displayed a cartoon illustration of the islands beneath an oversized Chinese flag. Japanese consumers were incensed. The company has lost more than \u00a360m on the project. WeChat, a smartphone instant messaging app similar to WhatsApp in the US, has taken off in south-east Asia and recently launched an advertising campaign in India featuring Bollywood stars. WeChat has a leg up on its competitors because of its easy-to-use interface and sophisticated integration of features: it combines an Instagram-like photo-sharing tool, a voice-messaging service, and an array of social functions designed for meeting strangers. Yet in January, users discovered that sending politically sensitive terms across international borders returned the words \"the message you sent contains restricted words. Please check it again.\" WeChat developer Tencent called the incident a \"glitch\". \"In terms of China's consumer internet, more than any cultural factors, the biggest barrier would be the regulations and protectionism surrounding the internet,\" says Kai Lukoff, co-founder of TechRice, a blog about China's tech sector. \"You have this iron curtain 2.0 that separates the internet culture in China from that of the rest of the world. So \u2026 when Chinese companies go abroad, they feel woefully out of place.\" Yet that has not stopped them from trying. This week, popular smartphone maker Xiaomi pulled off a coup by hiring Google's former vice-president for Android product management, Hugo Barra, to help it expand its global presence. The two-year-old company has established a reputation for producing high-quality, low-cost Android phones. The low-cost smartphone market is drawing Apple's interest, but Xiaomi is ahead, having already expanded to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Experts say Chinese companies in newer industries such as smartphones stand a better chance of gaining traction abroad. \"In western markets we have all these legacies, the infrastructure, built in: the desktop PC, the landline, the fax. In China, they could just leap ahead to the latest and greatest,\" says Rebecca Fannin, the author of Silicon Dragon: How China is Winning the Tech Race. Chinese companies have gone to great lengths to avoid the stigma associated with their country's brands. \"They produce a lot of stuff which western people like and use, they're just not under a Chinese brand name,\" says Sam Lipoff, a doctoral student at Harvard Business School who researches innovation in China. Domestic conglomerates often acquire foreign brands, and encourage them to maintain their native identities. Some of these deals have been extremely ambitious, such as the acquisition of British yacht maker Sunseeker by the Dalian Wanda conglomerate. Herborist, a Chinese cosmetics firm, has taken a different tack, marketing its products internationally as \"made in Shanghai\", evoking images of bustle and grandeur, rather than dark industrial-belt factories. \"This begs the question: what makes a company Chinese?\" Lipoff says. \"That its workers are in China? Or its offices? Or it sells to Chinese customers? Or has a Chinese name? This is an important thing to think about.\"",

      "body": "<p>China is the world's second-largest economy but it has yet to develop the breakthrough global brand that will consolidate its status as a true commercial superpower. The names of Chery, Xiaomi and Baidu are synonymous with cars, mobile phones and internet search in China but they do not resonate abroad in the way that Ford, Samsung and Google straddle the globe. Likewise, there is no Chinese equivalent of Sony, Boeing or Coca-Cola, despite the ambition of the political hierarchy to convert a nation of 1.3bn people into a consumption-driven juggernaut.</p> <p>That lack of a worldwide champion means that Made in China lacks prestige as a label, despite the country's importance as the world's factory floor, making everything from iPads to Topshop garments. And that reputation as a global manufacturing hub is one of the problems, nurturing a perception that China is synonymous with cheap, low-quality goods. Newspaper headlines in the west declaim stories about China's toxic baby milk, lead-contaminated toys and fake pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>But this is changing, as China's leaders force that economic shift from export-based growth to consumer spending. They are pumping money into research and development so that Chinese brands can compete with foreign rivals in a burgeoning domestic market. Furthermore, many of these companies have taken that baton and are running towards foreign markets, with the hope that global success will result. Much of the push comes in the form of state subsidies \u2013 <a href=\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-08/08/content_16880016.htm\" title=\"\">according to the state-run <em>China Daily</em> newspaper, the country spent \u00a3105bn on research and development last year</a>.</p> <p>A number of Chinese companies have delivered high-quality products abroad, mainly through combining with other international conglomerates. For example, computer maker Lenovo bought IBM's PC division in 2005 and five years later Geely Automobile bought Volvo from Ford. But analysts say China's quest to deliver a global brand, while fuelled by an abundance of cash and ambition, may face insurmountable obstacles such as a rigid corporate culture and a top-down approach to innovation. The draconian education system encourages rote memorisation over creativity, while its political system discourages risk-taking and going against the grain.</p> <p>\"There's a conflict of interest that China has \u2013 one which supports as well as deters innovation \u2013 and that is central government control,\" says Bill Dodson, the Shanghai-based author of <em>China Fast Forward: The Technologies, Green Industries and Innovations Driving the Mainland's Future</em>.
