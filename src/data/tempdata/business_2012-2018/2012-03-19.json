      "bodyText": "The Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph newspaper and the Ritz hotel, were accused of behaving \"dishonourably and unlawfully\" in a bitter battle over three of London's top hotels \u2013 Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley. Allegations centre on the way the twins wrested control of the parent firm from a group of Irish entrepreneurs, who had bought the company in an aggressively debt-fuelled deal eight years ago. One of the investors, property developer Paddy McKillen, who was outmanoeuvred by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay in a race to win control of the \u00a31bn hotels business last year, is claiming at the high court in London that the reclusive twins improperly paid \"very substantial sums\" to the wife of a fellow shareholder, Derek Quinlan, to help win control. The Barclays admitted making payments to the Quinlan family but insist these were separate from dealings concerning the hotels business, all of which were properly conducted. \"Helping the Quinlan family at their time of need is something I would never regret,\" Sir Frederick said in a witness statement. He has also said he is not prepared to give evidence in court. Quinlan, a former Dublin tax inspector, had been one of the leading lights in Ireland's credit and property boom but much of his empire collapsed after Ireland's 2008 banking crash. His shares in Coroin, the company behind the luxury hotels, had been pledged to banks for more than their value, meaning their eventual sale would not have generated a profit for him, McKillen's lawyers told the court. \"He was looking for a side deal, some kind of other way he could receive a significant payment, before he would enter into a deal with any particular purchaser. And that is exactly what he did with the Barclay brothers.\" McKillen believed he had first rights to buy Quinlan's shares under an agreement between the original investors. There is no dispute that repeated transfers were made from Barclay, who had acquired a holding in Coroin, to Quinlan's family. The brothers insist they have been friends with the Quinlans since 2005 and note that, in better times, the Irish businessman had made generous donations to charitable enterprises in which the Barclay family had a personal interest. Quinlan, who is expected to give evidence, is expected to tell the court the brothers have for some time been meeting the living expenses of his family, who now live in Putney, south-west London. On the opening day of what is expected to be a bitter and lengthy court battle, Lord Grabiner QC, counsel for the Barclays, sought to turn the tables on the brothers' accusers, claiming McKillen had failed to come to terms with his reduced means. Grabiner said the three hotels, together with the Savoy, which was later sold off, had been acquired by four men, led by Quinlan, \"riding a wave of cheap and easy Irish credit\" in 2004. A picture was painted of a business in dire straits, unable to cope with its borrowings, until the Barclays came to the rescue.

      "bodyText": "Eric Daniels, the former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, and three of his former senior colleagues have now missed out on bonuses totalling some \u00a37m as payouts continue to be clawed back. Daniels, who was chief executive of the bank until the end of February 2011, has been denied a total of almost \u00a32.5m of bonuses in the past year. Helen Weir, the former head of retail banking, who has recently been named as finance director at John Lewis, Truett Tate, former head of corporate banking, and Archie Kane, the former insurance boss, have each been denied around \u00a31.5m. The calculations are based on current share prices, around 37p, at which taxpayers lose around \u00a310bn on their 40% stake in the loss-making bank. The former directors have lost out as a result of three separate factors: the clawback from the 2010 bonus as a result of the \u00a33.2bn provision for payment protection insurance misselling; the decision by the bank not to release shares they were due for achieving cost savings from the integration of HBOS; and the failure to meet performance criteria attached to a three-year long-term incentive plan (LTIP) that ran until the end of 2011. The bank had already announced that Daniels had \u00a3580,000 clawed back from his 2010 bonus because of the PPI scandal, and it emerged that last week that \u00a3850,000 of shares would not be released from the integration share scheme put in place in 2009 shortly after the HBOS rescue. A filing for US regulators on Monday confirmed that the four would not be handed integration bonuses, and showed that Daniels will not now receive \u00a31.2m that he could have received if shares awarded to him three years ago under a long-term incentive plan had been released. The performance criteria attached to the LTIP have not been met. The decision to withhold the share payouts from the former directors was taken on March 14, too late to appear in the annual report which was published on March 15. The integration bonus, which was handed to employees who have remained at the bank, was based on the achievement of \u00a32bn-a-year cost savings from the HBOS deal, under which 28,000 jobs have been lost. Kane and Weir, who left in May, were handed \u00a3721,000 and \u00a3791,000 respectively for their work in 2011, according to the annual report, but missed out on \u00a31.5m and \u00a31.4m respectively.

Indeed, don't be dazzled by $10bn. Vodafone will pay slightly more (\u00a36.7bn) this year, albeit with the help of a \u00a32bn 'special' contribution from payments from Verizon Wireless, the US mobile phone firm where it owns 45%. The extraordinary thing is how Apple got away for so long without paying a dividend. Or, at least, it's amazing to UK eyes. In the UK, clinging on to shareholders' cash unnecessarily is almost regarded as an act of treason.

Which way is best? It's horses for courses. In Apple's case, though, those traditional American arguments about the need to hold vast piles of cash have started to wear thin.

That would still look like an over-embarrassment of riches. A complicating factor is that two-thirds of the hoard is held overseas and that Apple would incur a tax liability on repatriation to the US.

News that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has booked 11 giant tankers to ferry crude to the United States is a clear sign that the big players in the market fear there could be trouble ahead. The price of crude is rising because traders fear that the impact of western sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme could result in supply problems for the global economy. Brent crude is already trading at over $125 a barrel and, in the short term, looks more likely to hit $150 than $100. Exports from Iran are already down, and will fall further if the European Union's sanctions come into force in July. The Saudis are responding to US pressure to pump more oil to compensate for any shortfalls from Iran. Does this make sense? It certainly does. The world economy looks slightly healthier than it did three months ago, but is extremely fragile and remains vulnerable to a steep rise in crude prices, which would raise business costs and hammer consumer incomes. America is building up its stocks of oil in case the cold war between Iran and Israel turns hot. It may well.",

      "body": "<p>Things are warming up in the oil market. News that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has booked 11 giant tankers to ferry crude to the United States is a clear sign that the big players in the market fear there could be trouble ahead.</p> <p>The price of crude is rising because traders fear that the impact of western sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme could result in supply problems for the global economy. Brent crude is already trading at over $125 a barrel and, in the short term, looks more likely to hit $150 than $100.</p> <p>Exports from Iran are already down, and will fall further if the European Union's sanctions come into force in July. The Saudis are responding to US pressure to pump more oil to compensate for any shortfalls from Iran.</p> <p>Does this make sense? It certainly does. The world economy looks slightly healthier than it did three months ago, but is extremely fragile and remains vulnerable to a steep rise in crude prices, which would raise business costs and hammer consumer incomes. America is building up its stocks of oil in case the cold war between Iran and Israel turns hot. It may well.</p>",
