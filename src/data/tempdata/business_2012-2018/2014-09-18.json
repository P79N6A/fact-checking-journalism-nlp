      "bodyText": "French Connection has insisted that its turnaround is on track as it narrowed its losses for the first six months of the year but reported a sharp fall in sales at its stores. The fashion retailer made a group loss of \u00a33.9m for the six months to 31 July, down from \u00a36.1m a year ago. Stephen Marks, its founder and chief executive, said the figures were \"a further step forward as we rebuild value in our business\". \"The initiatives we put in place to drive a turnaround in our trading continue to deliver an improvement in performance,\" he said. The brand has struggled in recent years as cheaper high street rivals such as Topshop, Zara and H&amp;M stole the march. To win back customers the retailer has hired a new design team and set about closing unprofitable stores. It has also reduced the level of discounting in its stores \u2013 there was no mid-season sale and it delayed its summer sale by a week as well as keeping price reductions smaller. Marks pointed to hit products such as its \u00a3225 oversized Palace wool coat, with the first batch selling out last month, as evidence of the chain's improved appeal. Strong orders for the winter and spring seasons were also evidence of the strength of its new collections, he said. The closure programme led to a sharp fall in sales at its retail division, where turnover tumbled 10.6%. The retail arm's operating loss of \u00a37.5m was partially offset by the strong performance of its wholesale division which delivered an operating profit of \u00a36.2m. The retailer shut four loss-making stores during the period and said it planned to close a similar number in the second half. Although the headline performance was in line with market expectations some analysts were concerned about the outlook. Marks said it was a \"very competitive market place\" and added that he was cautious going into the key Christmas trading period. Fears about the outlook weighed on shares, which closed down more than 12% at 60p. Conlumino analyst George Scott said the performance showed French Connection remained \"a work-in-progress\". \"However the impact of its new design team now seem to be feeding through to retail, as seen in more positively consistent like-for-like sales at home and on the continent.\" Scott also welcomed the move away from discounting which was not only boosting profit margins but \"helping to steer the brand slightly more upmarket, which together with its newer design credentials is giving it a fresher edge\".",

Cooper is credited for boosting the cigarette firm with the \u00a35bn acquisition of US cigarette and e-cigarette brands. Carolyn McCall, the easyJet boss, was fifth, while a newcomer at six was Moya Greene, the Canadian running the newly-privatised Royal Mail.

The list is compiled by Fortune according to the size, importance and direction of the business the women are running, as well as their career arc and influence.

      "bodyText": "Supermarket price wars, a booming housing market and a rush to buy high-powered vacuum cleaners before they were banned by new EU environmental rules helped boost spending in the shops and online last month. Prospects of a sixth successive quarter of robust growth were boosted by official figures showing a 0.4% jump in retail sales last month and the strongest August mortgage lending since the month before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. But some hints of the slowdown in the pace of recovery predicted by the Bank of England for the second half of 2014 emerged from a steep fall in export orders reported by the CBI and by a weakening in the upward trend of consumer spending. The Office for National Statistics said bumper sales of energy-guzzling vacuum cleaners played a major role in keeping shop tills ringing \u2013 contributing 25% of the increase in retail sales last month. But the ONS data also highlighted the impact of the robust housing market on demand for furniture, carpets and consumer durables such as cookers and fridges. Sales of household goods were 12.7% higher in August than a year earlier, the strongest annual increase for 13 years. Furniture retailers reported year-on-year sales growth of more than 23%, the highest since recent records began in 1988. The ONS said the volume of retail sales in the latest three months was 0.5% up on the three months ending in May. That marked a slowdown from quarterly growth rates of 0.8% in the first quarter and 1.5% in the second. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight said: \"It is evident that many retailers continued to encourage consumers to spend by engaging in discounting and promotions in August.\" He pointed out that the ONS's price deflator, which is a proxy for sales prices, fell by 1.2%. \"While this reflected a sharp fall in petrol prices, it is notable that the retail sales deflator excluding petrol was down by 0.7% year-on-year with food stores' prices falling by 0.1% as the supermarket pricing war continued.\" The Council of Mortgage Lenders said its members lent \u00a318.6bn in August, 5% lower than July but 13% higher than August 2013. Although the figure includes remortgaging, the CML said the bulk was for house purchases. The last time August lending was so high was in 2008, when it hit \u00a319.3bn. CML chief economist Bob Pannell warned analysts should not read too much into the steep annual rise. \"A gentle slowing of lending activity may now be in prospect, as a result of the continuing impact of tighter lending rules and a softening of the London market,\" he said. The CBI said orders for Britain's factories had dried up as the slowdown in the eurozone and tension between Russia and the Ukraine led to a harsher climate for exporters. Its monthly snapshot found that firms were reporting a big drop in demand from overseas \u2013 falling to its lowest level since the start of 2013. Although firms said they had no immediate plans to cut back on output, the downbeat industrial trends survey from the UK's leading employers' organisation added to recent evidence that the economy will struggle to maintain the production levels seen in recent quarters. Of the 488 manufacturers quizzed, 24% said their total order books were above normal for September while 28% said they were below normal. The balance of -4 percentage points came after a +12 point balance in August and was the weakest for 11 months. Against a backdrop of renewed stagnation in the eurozone, and escalating tension in eastern Europe and the Middle East, only 14% of firms said their export order books were above normal against 38% saying they were below normal. Katja Hall, the CBI's deputy director general, said: \"Export orders for UK manufacturers are faltering, which is disappointing. However, it's encouraging that output growth has remained solid and firms expect production to rise strongly in the next quarter.\" More than a third of companies (36%) planned to boost output over the next three months, while 9% expected production cuts. The balance of +27% was slightly down on the +31% recorded in August.",

Instead PwC, charged with finding buyers for the business, is trying to sell parts of the company to the mobile network operators who have been accused of hastening its demise. Investors holding \u00a3430m of Phones 4u bonds had given hope to the retailer's 5,596 employees on Wednesday by proposing to swap their debt for shares in the business. But PwC said on a conference call with the bondholders on Thursday that there was no scope for such a deal. Rob Hunt, a PwC partner, said: \"Over the course of the last few days we have considered all restructuring options including a debt for equity swap. There is no realistic prospect of completing a debt for equity swap. \"We are still continuing to pursue dialogue with a range of parties for the core Phones 4u business. These are most live with three parties and we would hope at least one of those, and all three, would come through to a transaction in the coming days.\" Hunt did not explain why a rescue deal with bondholders had been ruled out but he revealed Phones 4u was spending \u00a31m a day of the \u00a3110m cash pile it had at the start of the week. It owes at least \u00a3200m to creditors excluding bondholders, PwC said. Hunt thanked Phones 4u's employees and said they would continue to be paid \"as a cost of the administration\" ahead of other creditors while PwC looked for buyers. Potential buyers of parts of the company, which has 550 standalone stores, include Vodafone and EE. The two operators have been accused by Phones 4u's owners of driving it out of business by ending their distribution deals, where the retailer sells contracts and handsets on behalf of those networks. Phones 4u closed its stores on Monday after EE's withdrawal, which followed Vodafone and earlier moves by O2 and 3. BC Partners, Phones 4u's private equity owner, has disputed Vodafone's claim that Phones 4u could not negotiate a viable distribution deal because BC had laden it with too much debt. EE has also indicated that Phones 4u's debt, which is more than \u00a3700m, was a problem in negotiations. Through its Phosphorous Jersey investment vehicle, BC called on bondholders to form a committee for direct talks. \"A lot has been written about this situation, and specifically about Vodafone's decision to withdraw from Phones 4u, followed shortly by a similar decision by EE. Phosphorus Jersey is concerned by the factual inaccuracy of certain reports,\" BC said. Mark Sterling, a partner at the law firm Allen &amp; Overy, which is advising PwC, said legal action against those involved in Phones 4u's disintegration was an option. \"The administrators will in due course want to investigate potential claims against third parties.\" Phones 4u had \u00a389m of stock of which \u00a367m was new handsets. About 60% of the handsets were made by Apple and Samsung and none of these were new products such as the iPhone 6. PwC expects to sell Phones 4u's profitable insurance business next week.",

    "webTitle": "European fruit growers bruised by Russian sanctions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Russia banned imports of Polish apples in July, politicians and the public laughed off the move by posing with the forbidden fruit on Twitter. Everyone from the head of the national security bureau to TV presenters posted gleeful photos, making the \"Eat apples to annoy Putin\" campaign a social media hit. Six weeks later, after the Kremlin extended its ban to all European fresh produce, from Greek peaches to German gherkins and Lithuanian cauliflowers, eating apples as a political statement is wearing thin. \"In the beginning there was a slight growth in consumption, but now it has gone back to normal,\" says Jolanta Kazimierska, head of the Polish Fruit Union. Last year Poland sold \u20ac840m (\u00a3670m) of produce to Russia, including a quarter of all its apples \u2013 1m tonnes of golden delicious, gala, champion and others. Now the trees are heavy with unsold fruit, leaving some growers on the brink of bankruptcy, according to Kazimierska. \"We are just praying that this situation improves because if it does not, we are facing real disaster.\" Prices have fallen to 0.9 zlotys (17p) per kilo, meaning the farmer barely recoups the cost of production, she said. But the full extent of the damage will only become clear at the end of the month when growers harvest all the apples grown for the Russian market. Fruit and vegetable farmers have been among the first to lose out from Russia's tit-for-tat sanctions. Almost one third of Europe's fruit and vegetables were sold to Russia and the ban has meant prices paid to some growers have fallen by 80%, according to Copa Cogeca, the European farmers' lobby group. In theory, European growers should be able to fill the gaps in world markets: if Russia for example buys more apples from South Africa, leaving Chinese buyers short, Poland can jump in. But in reality a lot of good fruit will spoil on the tree before deals can be done. \"We are trying to go to China and other Asian states, but it is a long-term process,\" said Kazimierska At the height of summer, several million kilos of Greek peaches and strawberries rotted in lorries that had been turned back at the Russian border. Now as the leaves turn golden, millions of autumn fruits are decaying in the orchard. Ad Klaassen, secretary general of the Fresh Produce Centre in the Netherlands \u2013 one of the countries hardest hit by the Russian ban- said 900 hectares (2220 acres) of Dutch orchards were likely to go unpicked, because it was not worth the cost of harvesting. The situation is especially tough for Dutch pear growers, with prices 50% lower than last year. Klaassen says the price of vegetables has recovered after an initial drop, but he fears tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and aubergines will plummet in value when a new batch is harvested from Dutch greenhouses early next year. With some prices falling to record lows, EU authorities in Brussels came up with a \u20ac125m fund to pay farmers to reduce supply, either by turning their crop into compost, letting it rot, or donating fruit to schools and hospitals. More than \u20ac82m was allocated for apples and pears alone. But last week the European commission suspended the scheme, after being flooded with what officials deemed as dubious claims for compensation. Poland alone asked for \u20ac145m, including claims for some vegetables that are barely more than seeds. \"In one member state there has been a lot of enthusiasm for the scheme,\" said a commission source. \"[The claims] are not entirely realistic and they haven't really read the rules.\" Stricter rules are expected to come into force early next week, [from 22 September] meaning no country can claim more than the value of produce they previously exported to Russia. But demands for further compensation are building. With Spain pleading for the scheme to be opened to citrus fruits and Romania lobbying for onions, the commission is also battling member states who want to raid the non-farm part of the EU budget \u2013 worth \u20ac84bn in 2014 \u2013 for emergency funds. The commission, a civil service with political leaders, opposes the move. A spokesperson said: \"member states wanted the 2014 \u2013 2020 EU budget radically cut. They got that, therefore there are limits to what the EU budget can do.\" He noted there were also calls for extra funds to help Ukrainian civilians, Iraqi and Syrian refugees, tackle Ebola, as well as aid EU farmers. British fruit growers have so far been largely isolated from the problem, because they exported very little fruit to Russia, but they could lose out if the market is flooded by cheap Polish apples and Dutch pears. Prices on wholesale markets \u2013 where street traders and small shops source their apples \u2013 have already fallen, but the big supermarkets, which sell 85% of the nation's apples and pears, have long-term contracts that cannot be switched quickly. Adrian Barlow, chief executive of the trade body English Apples and Pears, thinks supermarkets will not risk a consumer backlash by buying up cheap apples from the continent, just as native varieties, such as cox and royal gala, are arriving on the shelves. But he is concerned that depressed prices could undermine UK growers in the long run. Sales of English apples have been rising, after a long period when local fruit fell out of favour and consumers got a taste for France's Golden Delicious and New Zealand's Pink Lady varieties. \"There is a long-term effect because the returns to growers are adversely affected. That encourages some people to cut corners \u2013 not in this country, but overseas \u2013 and because of that we are not going to see the continued revival of the English apple market.\" Fallen fruit Price falls across the EU in late August compared to average prices for previous three growing seasons: Apples \u2013 20% Pears \u2013 50% Peaches \u2013 40% Carrots \u2013 8% Cauliflowers \u2013 32% Peppers \u2013 34% Source: Guardian caluculations based on European commission data",

      "body": "<p>When Russia banned imports of Polish apples in July, politicians and the public laughed off the move by posing with the forbidden fruit on Twitter. Everyone from the head of the national security bureau to TV presenters posted gleeful photos, making the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/poland-takes-bite-out-russian-apple-ban\" title=\"\">\"Eat apples to annoy Putin\"</a> campaign a social media hit.</p> <p>Six weeks later, after the Kremlin extended its ban to all European fresh produce, from Greek peaches to German gherkins and Lithuanian cauliflowers, eating apples as a political statement is wearing thin. \"In the beginning there was a slight growth in consumption, but now it has gone back to normal,\" says Jolanta Kazimierska, head of the Polish Fruit Union.</p> <p>Last year Poland sold \u20ac840m (\u00a3670m) of produce to Russia, including a quarter of all its apples \u2013 1m tonnes of golden delicious, gala, champion and others. Now the trees are heavy with unsold fruit, leaving some growers on the brink of bankruptcy, according to Kazimierska. \"We are just praying that this situation improves because if it does not, we are facing real disaster.\"</p> <p>Prices have fallen to 0.9 zlotys (17p) per kilo, meaning the farmer barely recoups the cost of production, she said. But the full extent of the damage will only become clear at the end of the month when growers harvest all the apples grown for the Russian market.</p> <p>Fruit and vegetable farmers have been among the first to lose out from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/putin-ban-food-imports-russian-shoppers-respond\" title=\"\">Russia's tit-for-tat sanctions</a>. Almost one third of Europe's fruit and vegetables were sold to Russia and the ban has meant prices paid to some growers have fallen by 80%, according to Copa Cogeca, the European farmers' lobby group.</p> <p>In theory, European growers should be able to fill the gaps in world markets: if Russia for example buys more apples from South Africa, leaving Chinese buyers short, Poland can jump in.</p> <p>But in reality a lot of good fruit will spoil on the tree before deals can be done. \"We are trying to go to China and other Asian states, but it is a long-term process,\" said Kazimierska</p> <p>At the height of summer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/greece-farmers-russian-sanctions-rotten-fruit\" title=\"\">several million kilos of Greek peaches and strawberries rotted in lorries</a> that had been turned back at the Russian border. Now as the leaves turn golden, millions of autumn fruits are decaying in the orchard.</p> <p>Ad Klaassen, secretary general of the Fresh Produce Centre in the Netherlands \u2013 one of the countries hardest hit by the Russian ban- said 900 hectares (2220 acres) of Dutch orchards were likely to go unpicked, because it was not worth the cost of harvesting.</p> <p>The situation is especially tough for Dutch pear growers, with prices 50% lower than last year. Klaassen says the price of vegetables has recovered after an initial drop, but he fears tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and aubergines will plummet in value when a new batch is harvested from Dutch greenhouses early next year.</p> <p>With some prices falling to record lows, EU authorities in Brussels came up with a \u20ac125m fund to pay farmers to reduce supply, either by turning their crop into compost, letting it rot, or donating fruit to schools and hospitals. More than \u20ac82m was allocated for apples and pears alone. But last week the European commission suspended the scheme, after being flooded with what officials deemed as dubious claims for compensation.</p> <p>Poland alone asked for \u20ac145m, including claims for some vegetables that are barely more than seeds. \"In one member state there has been a lot of enthusiasm for the scheme,\" said a commission source. \"[The claims] are not entirely realistic and they haven't really read the rules.\"</p> <p>Stricter rules are expected to come into force early next week, [from 22 September] meaning no country can claim more than the value of produce they previously exported to Russia.

Jack Ma was an English teacher when he started the site from his one-bedroom apartment in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in 1998.</p> <p>2. In its early days, staff would pretend they were not Chinese when sending emails to American customers.</p> <p>3. It dominates internet retailing in China, where it powers 80% of online commerce.</p> <p>4. Alibaba is not Ma's first e-commerce venture \u2013 he founded China Yellowpages, said to be the first internet company in China.</p> <p>5. He set up Alibaba with $60,000 borrowed from 18 people.</p> <p>6. Ma first came across the internet in 1995 during a trip to Seattle. His first search? \"Beer\".</p> <p>7. Alibaba's sales for 2014 are estimated at $420bn (\u00a3257bn), dwarfing Amazon and eBay which had a combined turnover of $90bn in 2013.</p> <p>8. It has 300m customers - just short of the entire US population.</p> <p>9. On a single promotional day in November 2013, Alibaba recorded sales of $5.6bn.</p> <p>10. Ma is currently estimated to be China's third richest person, with a $10.3bn fortune. The float should catapult him into first place.</p> <p>11. His shareholding in Alibaba is 8.9%.</p> <p>12. Ma came up with the name Alibaba in a coffee shop in San Francisco. He pulled his waitress over to ask what she knew about Ali Baba and she replied: \"Open Sesame.\" He says the name reflects how his business opens up opportunities for small businesses to sell their goods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-447541060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/13/1410604470818/Jack-Ma-011.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Ma\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Ma: founder and chairman of Alibaba.

      "bodyText": "When Alibaba makes its debut on the New York stock market on Friday, it will be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO). Here are 40 facts you didn't know: 1. Jack Ma was an English teacher when he started the site from his one-bedroom apartment in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in 1998. 2. In its early days, staff would pretend they were not Chinese when sending emails to American customers. 3. It dominates internet retailing in China, where it powers 80% of online commerce. 4. Alibaba is not Ma's first e-commerce venture \u2013 he founded China Yellowpages, said to be the first internet company in China. 5. He set up Alibaba with $60,000 borrowed from 18 people. 6. Ma first came across the internet in 1995 during a trip to Seattle. His first search? \"Beer\". 7. Alibaba's sales for 2014 are estimated at $420bn (\u00a3257bn), dwarfing Amazon and eBay which had a combined turnover of $90bn in 2013. 8. It has 300m customers - just short of the entire US population. 9. On a single promotional day in November 2013, Alibaba recorded sales of $5.6bn. 10. Ma is currently estimated to be China's third richest person, with a $10.3bn fortune. The float should catapult him into first place. 11. His shareholding in Alibaba is 8.9%. 12. Ma came up with the name Alibaba in a coffee shop in San Francisco. He pulled his waitress over to ask what she knew about Ali Baba and she replied: \"Open Sesame.\" He says the name reflects how his business opens up opportunities for small businesses to sell their goods. 13. Critics say fake goods appear rife on many Alibaba sites, although the company claims to spend millions rooting them out. 14. It is expected that at least $22bn of shares will be sold on Thursday, in what is expected to be the world's largest IPO. 15 If underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares, Alibaba's market debut will top Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's record $22.1bn listing in 2010. 16. The company will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 17. Its shares will trade under the ticker \"BABA\". 18. New York was chosen for Alibaba's debut after the Hong Kong stock exchange's officials rejected its request to allow a small group of company insiders to nominate the majority of the board. 19. Ma is well known for his flamboyance and has entertained staff singing The Lion King (view the video here, from 1.04). 20. When he needs inspiration, Ma returns to the flat where he started the company. 21. In a letter sent to staff the day that Alibaba filed its IPO prospectus, he said: \"We will continue to adhere to the principle of 'customers first, employees second, shareholders third'.\" 22. The company employs more than 25,000 people. 23. The biggest shopping site under the Alibaba umbrella is Taobao, where 7m merchants sell their wares. 24. After the IPO, power at the e-commerce giant will be concentrated in the hands of a 28-person partnership. 25. The power structure has led to criticism that if an investor were unhappy about the direction of the company, they would have little ability to change it. 26. New York was chosen for the listing in part due to its more relaxed attitude to voting, which will let Ma retain his grip on the company. 27. The corporate structure will allow Ma and other senior staff to nominate more than half of the board members. 28. It is thought Alibaba will target US and European markets after it lists despite low recognition of the brand. 29 A recent US poll found that 88% of respondents had not heard of Alibaba. 30. Ma has always been confident of dominating China and fending off eBay: \"eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I am a crocodile in the Yangtze river. If we fight in the ocean, we lose \u2013 but if we fight in the river, we win.\" 31. Ma is said to be influenced by martial arts and kung fu movies and their principles of upholding righteousness. 32. More than 50% of parcels sent in China are Alibaba parcels. 33. Ma's talent for public-speaking and showmanship hailed from his parents, both past performers in the traditional storytelling art of ping tan. 34. Much of the interest in Alibaba hails from investors eager to exploit China's booming economy. 35. A team from Alibaba visited New York, Boston, Hong Kong and Singapore to drum up investor support. 36.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese online giant Alibaba will set the price of its shares on Thursday in what is expected to be the world's biggest-ever initial public offering (IPO). Anticipation is building among investors in advance of the eagerly awaited IPO, which is expected to raise up to $22bn (\u00a313.5bn). Shares in the company, which has been described as a combination of Amazon and eBay for China, will be priced after the close of the New York Stock Exchange and will start trading there on Friday. The sale of shares in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which will be listed under the ticker BABA, follows a two-week global roadshow which has resulted in frenzied interest from investors eager to buy into the rapid growth of China's internet sector. The founder and executive chairman of the company, Jack Ma, disappointed British investors when he failed to show up at a briefing in London on Wednesday, instead leaving the explanation of Alibaba's structure and revenue streams to more junior staff. Ma, 50, whose flamboyant style has seen him dress up as Lady Gaga in the past to entertain staff, started Alibaba 15 years ago in his one-bedroom flat and retains a 9% stake. Since then, Alibaba has come to power 80% of all online commerce conducted in China, the world's second-largest economy. It has also branched out into areas such as e-payments and financial investment. The floatation is expected to confirm him as China's richest man. The strong demand from investors prompted Alibaba to boost the IPO price range to between $66 and $68 a share. At the top end of that range, the IPO would raise almost $22bn, but if underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares, Alibaba's market debut will top Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's record $22.1bn listing in 2010. \"We believe that the current pricing range of $66-$68 significantly undervalues the long-term growth potential of the company,\" said CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi. The complex governance structure in the company and Ma's outside investments have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and investors' ability to sway Alibaba's strategy. The company decided to list its shares in New York after Hong Kong stock exchange officials rejected its request to allow a small group of company insiders to nominate the majority of the board. The IPO caps a lengthy listing process in which Alibaba took the rare step of not appointing a single bank to take charge of the process. Instead, it tapped all its major bookrunners for advice, and divided tasks among them. Alibaba plans to expand its business in the US and Europe, where it is not widely known, after the deal.

And China will have to mitigate financial risks if it hopes to avoid a hard landing. The final source of uncertainty is the corporate sector. So far this year, healthy companies have slowly been loosening their purse strings \u2013 a notable departure from the risk-averse behaviour that has prevailed since the global financial crisis. Indeed, an increasing number of firms have started to deploy the massive stocks of cash held on their balance sheets, first to increase dividends and buy back shares, and then to pursue mergers and acquisitions at a rate last seen in 2007. The question is whether companies also will finally devote more cash to new investments in plant, equipment, and people \u2013 a key source of support for the global economy. This is a rather weighty list of questions. Yet financial-market participants have largely bypassed them, brushing aside today's major risks and ignoring the potential volatility that they imply. Instead, financial investors have trusted in the steadfast support of central banks, confident that the monetary authorities will eventually succeed in transforming policy-induced growth into genuine growth. And, of course, they have benefited considerably from the deployment of corporate cash. In the next few months, the buoyant optimism pervading financial markets may prove to be justified. Unfortunately, it is more likely that investors' outlook is excessively rosy. \u2022 Mohamed A. El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and a member of its international executive committee.
