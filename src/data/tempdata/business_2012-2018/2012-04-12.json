      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail has capped the number of stamps that shops can buy before price rises come into force later this month, leading to accusations of profiteering. The postal service said it has limited shops' supplies in a bid to prevent retailers from profiting at its expense from the hike in stamp prices that comes into force on April 30. The Royal Mail wants instead to ensure that it benefits from the price rises, which will see the price of first-class stamps increasing by 30% from 46p to 60p from 30 April, and second-class stamps rising by 39% from 36p to 50p. The postal service denied that the cap has led to a shortage of stamps, claiming that retailers had a \"reasonable and proportionate allocation\". Royal Mail spokesman James Eadie said: \"We do have a sensible allocation in place so that individual retailers can pre-order in advance of the price rise, based on their normal full-year expectations of demand. These allocations are in place for all retailers so that we can balance the customer demand with the need to protect Royal Mail's revenues. \"This is a prudent and appropriate policy. Our priority is to ensure that the proceeds from this much needed price rise go to sustain the six-day-a-week service, which has been loss making for some time. \"We have put arrangements in place with all our major retailers to ensure that they have adequate stocks of stamps to meet customer demand.\" The spokesman added he was \"fully satisfied\" that post offices have enough stamps to meet customer demand. \"There is no shortage of stamps. Therefore, by definition, there is no rationing. Companies only ration if there is a genuine shortage, which there is not,\" he said. Retailers said they had seen a fivefold rise in sales as people stocked up on stamps at the cheaper price, the Daily Telegraph reported. The paper said that Ocado, the online supermarket, ran out of stamps entirely earlier this month, while Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons had seen a sharp rise in demand. Ian Murray, the shadow postal affairs minster, told the paper he would write to Ofcom, the postal regulator, urging it to investigate the \"shameless profiteering at the public's expense\" by Royal Mail.",

Roger Whiteside, Punch chief executive, said: \"Despite weaker consumer market conditions in recent months, our teams have worked hard to contain costs and deliver profits in line with our expectations for the first half and we remain on track to meet our full-year profit expectations.\" While Whiteside attempted to put a positive spin on the numbers, most shareholders are focused on the company's efforts to restructure its debts. The company has previously said it is considering plans to restructure its \u00a32.3bn of borrowings amid speculation that bondholders could be asked to write down some of the money they are owed. Analysts cannot see how the company can improve its share price, which closed down nearly 10% at 9.5p on the figures, without a positive resolution to the talks. Simon French, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, wrote to clients: \"Further equity value creation is dependent on the outcome of talks with bondholders during 2012. We reiterate our hold recommendation and 11p target price.\" The group added that its southern pubs continue to perform better than those in the north, which has been harder hit by the economic downturn. The tough conditions reflect those seen at rival JD Wetherspoon, which last month said it would slow the pace of its expansion amid sustained cost pressures and weaker sales.",

Another shareholder said statistics on leaks in the BP annual report failed to show a true picture of the problems.</p> <p>The most potent attacks came from Gulf residents who had flown over to the UK and bought shares in the business so they could challenge the management view that it was business as usual in the region.</p> <p>Derrick Evans, from Gulfport, Mississippi, said he spoke on behalf of \"scores of everyday people\". The company had painted a rosy PR picture that \"falls short\" on the ground, he said, adding that many people in his region faced an ongoing \"disaster\", while the cleanup operation was a \"fiasco\".</p> <p>Bryan Parris, a Houston man, demanded to know what chemicals were used in the enormous quantities of dispersants used to try to keep the sticky crude off the beaches.</p> <p>He said there was an \"epidemic of health problems\" due to these dispersants among Gulf residents but his complaints were quickly dismissed by Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman of BP, who insisted his company had acted responsibly. \"We have done everything we possibly can to compensate those with a legitimate claim.\"</p> <p>Shareholders also complained about the company's involvement in the carbon-heavy tar sands in Canada and its role in adding to global warming while 11% of them voted against the company's remuneration package. One shareholder said the pay packets suggested executives might have their \"snouts in the trough\".</p> <p>Meanwhile rival Shell was fighting off speculation that it has caused a sheen of oil that was detected in the Gulf and which caused its share price to plunge 5% in early trading and knocked more than $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) off its value.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch company sent a vessel to investigate and later put out a statement saying it was \"confident\" that the slick, which measured 10 miles by one mile, did not originate from its nearby Mars or Ursa facilities.

      "bodyText": "An attempt by BP management to move on from the Gulf of Mexico crisis that has dogged it over the last two years was undermined at a turbulent annual meeting when the oil group came under fierce fire from its own shareholders. More than 10% of investors voted against a \u00a34m pay package secured by chief executive Bob Dudley while directors were attacked for continuing safety lapses and accused of painting an over \"rosy\" picture of the US cleanup. The atmosphere among environmentalists at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands on Thursday was further poisoned by reports of another oil spill in the Gulf that was attributed to Shell plus the continuing gas leak on Total's Elgin field in the North Sea. Bob Dudley, the chief executive who was brought in after the Deepwater Horizon accident to replace the much-pilloried Tony Hayward, thanked shareholders for \"sticking with\" BP. He admitted the business had come through a \"major crisis\" but said it was back on track due to the commitment of its staff, a raft of measures to improve safety across the group and a sell-off of non-core assets. But a procession of Gulf residents and long-term shareholders berated the besuited men on the podium who preside over a share price that remains heavily depressed compared to pre-spill days. One shareholder and former BP employee claimed recent North Sea statistics showed his old company spilling more oil than any other. Another shareholder said statistics on leaks in the BP annual report failed to show a true picture of the problems. The most potent attacks came from Gulf residents who had flown over to the UK and bought shares in the business so they could challenge the management view that it was business as usual in the region. Derrick Evans, from Gulfport, Mississippi, said he spoke on behalf of \"scores of everyday people\". The company had painted a rosy PR picture that \"falls short\" on the ground, he said, adding that many people in his region faced an ongoing \"disaster\", while the cleanup operation was a \"fiasco\". Bryan Parris, a Houston man, demanded to know what chemicals were used in the enormous quantities of dispersants used to try to keep the sticky crude off the beaches. He said there was an \"epidemic of health problems\" due to these dispersants among Gulf residents but his complaints were quickly dismissed by Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman of BP, who insisted his company had acted responsibly. \"We have done everything we possibly can to compensate those with a legitimate claim.\" Shareholders also complained about the company's involvement in the carbon-heavy tar sands in Canada and its role in adding to global warming while 11% of them voted against the company's remuneration package. One shareholder said the pay packets suggested executives might have their \"snouts in the trough\". Meanwhile rival Shell was fighting off speculation that it has caused a sheen of oil that was detected in the Gulf and which caused its share price to plunge 5% in early trading and knocked more than $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) off its value. The Anglo-Dutch company sent a vessel to investigate and later put out a statement saying it was \"confident\" that the slick, which measured 10 miles by one mile, did not originate from its nearby Mars or Ursa facilities. But Total continues to grapple with a gas leak on the Elgin platform in the UK North Sea which has been continuing for two weeks. Dudley said BP had offered to help. Exact blame for the fateful night of April 20, 2010, when an explosion on board the drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, caused the deaths of 11 oil workers and triggered an environmental crisis on the beaches around the Gulf of Mexico, has yet to be apportioned by the Department of Justice, which is still considering whether to press criminal charges. In the intervening time the London-based oil group \u2013 and operator of the well \u2013 has forked out $14bn in an oil spill response operation and a further $8bn in compensation to some of those fishermen and residents whose livelihoods were devastated.",

    "webTitle": "OECD report will please George Osborne", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If you want to understand why George Osborne is so keen on austerity, you could do worse than dip into a report released on Thursday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which details how much pain countries in the rich west are going to have to endure in order to knock their public finances into shape. Plenty, is the short answer. The Paris-based thinktank says western countries' aim should be to reduce national debt to 50% of national output by 2050 and, given the damage caused by a seemingly unending downturn, that will require a long struggle. For the UK, it says the annual budget deficit needs to be improved by more than 8% of GDP \u2013 in excess of \u00a3120bn in today's money. Osborne will like this study, since it provides intellectual cover for his deficit-reduction programme. He agrees with the OECD's analysis that western countries need to do urgent repair work to their finances before the big structural challenges posed by the ageing of the baby-boomer generation start to manifest themselves. The reasoning behind the OECD report is relatively straightforward. Countries that have high debt levels suffer because a large chunk of public spending has to be earmarked to pay the interest on the debt, and they tend to have to pay higher interest rates to investors when they borrow money in the financial markets. This is not always the case: Japan, for example, combines the highest debt to GDP ratio in the western world with low long-term interest rates. Crucially, though, Japan has very high levels of domestic savings that it can use to finance its deficit. Most countries are not in this fortunate position. So if high levels of debt are bad news, what is all the fuss about? Surely it makes sense to get on with the job of reducing budget deficits without delay? There are at least three points that need to be made. The first is that the current debt levels look high in comparison to where they were before the recession, but in historical terms do not look all that alarming. Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio was well over 200% at the end of the second world war. The second point is the 50% target set by the OECD is a bit arbitrary. Most research shows that countries have to be running much higher levels before there is an impact on growth. Work by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart suggest that debt only really starts to be a problem when it is in excess of 90% of GDP. The OECD says a 50% target would leave its rich member states with a margin of safety; some might say this is an excessive amount of wriggle-room. Thirdly, it may be that we are getting things back to front. Debt levels tend to increase for those countries that are struggling, so it is arguable that low growth leads to high debt levels, rather than high debt levels leading to lower growth. After the second world war, it was year after year of strong growth (plus a bit of inflation) that brought debt levels down, not austerity. Osborne is right to be worried about debt. Ed Balls would be worried about it if he were chancellor. This, though, is not really about ends but about means \u2013 how much austerity the economy can bear before it kills off the growth that has to be a big component of any deficit reduction plan, and the right mix between fiscal and monetary policy. At present, monetary policy is doing all the heavy lifting, but quantitative easing contains risks of its own, not least the serious repercussions if financial markets suspected for a moment that central banks were secretly seeking to \"monetise\" (inflate away) the debt.",
