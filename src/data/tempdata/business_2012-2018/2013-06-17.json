    "webTitle": "Co-operative Bank to list on stock market in rescue deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank is to have its shares listed on the stock market for the first time as part of a deal to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall and stave off nationalisation after its troubled merger with Britannia Building Society four years ago. As a result of an agreement hammered out with the Prudential Regulation Authority, the bank's bondholders \u2013 including 7,000 private investors \u2013 will be asked to take losses in return for shares in a move that has raised concerns about the future of the co-operative movement and the bank's ethical ethos. Although the bank was already a public limited company owned by the Co-operative Group \u2013 the country's biggest mutual, which owns grocers, funeral homes and pharmacy chains \u2013 it will end up with shares listed on the stock exchange under a complex \"bail in\" of bondholders in October. The \"bail in\" is a new, largely untested method for helping banks raise capital and will allow the Co-op to avoid having to raid other parts of its business. It is the route the authorities are now adopting, after the wave of taxpayer bailouts in2008-09. The bank, which has 4.7 million customers but has stopped lending to businesses, had run low on capital after incurring losses on commercial property loans largely granted by Britannia before the 2009 merger between the two organisations. Some \u00a314.5bn of loans, largely granted by Britannia, have been put into a non-core bad bank to be sold off or run down. Until April, Co-op had been in talks to take over 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group, which would have put more capital into the enlarged bank. Lloyds' bosses will appear before the Treasury select committee of MPs on Tuesday to face questions on this so-called Verde deal, which the government had hoped would inject more competition into a high street dominated by the big four banks. The Co-op has installed new management at group level and at the bank but on Monday none would discuss the past. However, the new chief executive of the bank, Niall Booker, conceded that the capital-raising exercise would probably not have been needed if the Britannia deal had not taken place. Booker, a former HSBC executive, started last week. His predecessor left in May after ratings agency Moody's downgraded the Co-op's investment rating to junk status. \"It's apparent that with the Britannia deal came some bad loans that needed to be worked out and it's equally apparent that the franchise strength lies in the retail and SME [small and medium enterprises] segment of the Co-op,\" Booker said. Euan Sutherland, the former B&amp;Q boss who has been chief executive of the overall Co-op Group for six weeks, refused to say whether bonuses would be clawed back from departed directors. \"The time will come when we are able to look back at what happened,\" he said. The newly installed group finance director, Richard Pennycook, hired from supermarket chain Morrisons, was reluctant to stand by accounts issued by the bank. \"We'll take the fifth amendment on that,\" said Pennycook, who added that an important step was being taken to solve a \"pretty unstable\" situation. Some 5% of the bonds affected \u2013 some of which pay 13.5% interest \u2013 are held by retail investors, whose average investment was \u00a31,000 each. The precise detail of their losses will not become clear until full details of the \"exchange offer\" are published before October, when the shares will be listed in London. The abortive deal with Lloyds helped shed light on the scale of the Co-op's problems. When Lloyds chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio and chairman Sir Win Bischoff give evidence to MPs on the episode on Tuesday they may face questions about government interference after a Conservative MP, David Davis, wrote to the Times saying the Treasury should explain its role. Mark Hoban, City minister at the time, is known to have held 30 meetings to smooth the deal. Despite assurances by the Co-op that the deal would not affect its approach to business and customers, Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said the bail in was a profound change in the business model of the bank. \"This change is likely to clash with the co-operative ethos of the bank and, in the longer term, this might undermine what has made the Co-op attractive to its staff and customers,\" Spicer said. Once the bank's shares are listed on the stock market, the Co-op Group will retain a majority holding of around 75%. The Co-op Group will contribute \u00a31bn to bolster the bank \u2013 some \u00a3500m through selling off insurance businesses and another \u00a3500m by issuing bonds to existing bondholders. The bank's bondholders will raise the other \u00a3500m through the exchange offer while the bank has until the end of the year to reach a higher capital threshold than rivals of 9%. The results of an industry-wide exercise by the PRA, which uncovered a \u00a325bn capital shortfall, will be published on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron and George Osborne are planning a last-ditch push to persuade leaders of the west's leading industrial nations to soften their opposition to plans for a global crackdown on tax evasion. With aid campaigners stepping up the pressure for a comprehensive deal that would include developing countries, the prime minister and the chancellor were trying to prevent proposals being watered down by resistance from other western leaders. Sources said there were two key issues that would be decided in the talks, which will take place over the next 24 hours: whether registers of the beneficiaries of offshore accounts would be made public and whether a G8 deal to exchange tax information would be open to poor nations. \"We will see where we get to,\" one government source said on Monday. \"It is still unclear, but we are confident of a good outcome. \"It will be significantly better than anyone would have expected six months ago.\" Osborne will fly to Northern Ireland to brief G8 leaders on the technical aspects of the UK's tax proposals when the summit discusses the issue on Tuesday morning. The UK is pressing for the G8 to make registers of beneficial ownership open to scrutiny by the public, but some countries \u2013 such as Canada and Russia \u2013 have been strongly resistant to the idea. Cameron is looking for at least one or two other G8 countries to commit to public registers and is hopeful that France and the US will provide support for the UK line. Britain also wants the summit communique to make clear that the G8 is committed to a global agreement on exchange of tax information that developing countries can join. While Cameron believes progress has been made, it is still unclear whether the summit will agree to allowing developing countries access to tax information from the G8 without a deal that would oblige poor countries to reciprocate, something they would struggle to do. Brendan Cox, a spokesman for the IF campaign, a coalition of charities and advocacy groups, said the G8 would only deliver a deal if there was a clear commitment to public registers of beneficial ownership. \"There needs to be a critical mass, even if not the whole G8,\" he said. \"If the UK does not get any other countries to go public that will be disappointing.\" Cox said the G8 had to specify that the agreement on automatic exchange of tax information would include developing countries from the outset.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Technology company leads FTSE 100 fallers on fears of growing competition from Intel in key market", 
      "body": "<p>Markets moved higher ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve meeting, but UK chip designers missed out on the rally.</p> <p><strong>Arm</strong> dropped 32p to 830p on growing concerns about increased competition from rival Intel, while <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> lost 10.7p to 304.7p despite announcing a licensing deal with US semiconductor group Cavium.</p> <p>Analysts believe Intel could increasingly make inroads into Arm's smartphone market, which Arm's move into servers may not be able to make up. Analyst Nick James at Numis cut his target price from 920p to 700p and his recommendation from hold to reduce. He said:</p> <blockquote> Intel has made a breakthrough in finally having competitive chips for smartphones and tablets against Arm based competitors and it could have a period of leadership. At the same time the landscape of credible Arm based mobile apps processor vendors appears to be dwindling. Combined these dynamics cause us to review our market share assumptions, increasing our forecast share for Intel in the smartphone/tablet markets and reducing the assumed Arm share. This combined with updated foreign exchange assumptions drives 10%/12%/12% downgrades to earnings per share in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. We also note our second quarter estimates are below consensus largely due to lower PD royalties, where we forecast a 14% sequential decline (from fall off of strong Apple and other smartphone chip builds in the third and fourth quarter), whereas consensus looks too optimistic with just a 3% sequential decline. <br> We cut base case forecasts of Arm's CPU share in smartphones to 72% from 86% in 2014 and beyond. Our current thinking is that the balance of 28% goes to Intel, however we believe there are scenarios where Intel could gain up to 40% share if it managed to enable some breakthrough devices at the likes of Sony/Amazon/Motorola, all of which have strong brands and distribution. </blockquote> <p>Since an investor day on 22 May, Arm shares have lost around 22% of their value.</p> <p>As for Imagination, its shares were hit by a downgrade from Barclays which moved from overweight to equal weight with a 300p price target.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 22.23 points higher at 6330.49 as fears eased that the US Federal Reserve meeting could see an easing of its bond buying programme, one of the central bank planks supporting the market in recent months. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> After four consecutive weeks of declines Europe's markets have started the week on the front foot ahead of this week's potentially market moving Fed meeting. Markets are assuming that this week's meeting could well see the Fed lower its economic forecasts in line with recent independent expectations from the IMF, World Bank and OECD, and if they do so it would make it much less likely that we will see any prospect of [easing] any time soon. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> added 2.65p to 182.7p on renewed hopes of consolidation in the mobile sector. This followed reports AT&amp;T was interested in Spain's Telefonica but had been rebuffed, although this was subsequently denied. Vodafone itself is said to be preparing an increased offer for Kabel Deutschland.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Resolution </strong>rose 8p to 283.1p following news that JP Morgan had raised its target price on the insurer from 273p to 302p, albeit with a neutral rating:</p> <blockquote> Continuing delivery around cost savings and improving market conditions underpin its strong dividend yield of 7.6% versus the sector at 4.0%. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Legal and General</strong> lost 0.3p to 170.6p despite unveiling a new finance director after almost a year of searching.</p> <p>Since Nigel Wilson moved from the role to become chief executive, L&amp;G has had an interim finance director in the form of Wadham Downing. Now Mark Gregory, a 15 year L&amp;G veteran who is currently head of its savings business, will take on the role with effect from next month. Reports earlier this month suggested regulators were not happy with L&amp;G's initial suggestions for the role.</p> <p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> jumped 100p to \u00a346.79 after a positive note from Citigroup on the Cillit Bang maker. The bank issued a buy note, saying the company's pharmaceutical business was trading at less than half its potential value. It said:</p> <blockquote> We are buyers of Reckitt for the recovery of its core business and for its potential in consumer health. However, we also think [the pharmaceutical business] is under-valued by the market, particularly in light of its early resilience to the recent entry of generic competition in the US Suboxone market. <br> We value Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceutical at \u00a35.2bn, or 710p per share. We think the current share price implies a \u00a32bn valuation, or 275p per share, which our scenario analysis finds too conservative.

      "bodyText": "Markets moved higher ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve meeting, but UK chip designers missed out on the rally. Arm dropped 32p to 830p on growing concerns about increased competition from rival Intel, while Imagination Technologies lost 10.7p to 304.7p despite announcing a licensing deal with US semiconductor group Cavium. Analysts believe Intel could increasingly make inroads into Arm's smartphone market, which Arm's move into servers may not be able to make up. Analyst Nick James at Numis cut his target price from 920p to 700p and his recommendation from hold to reduce. He said: Intel has made a breakthrough in finally having competitive chips for smartphones and tablets against Arm based competitors and it could have a period of leadership. At the same time the landscape of credible Arm based mobile apps processor vendors appears to be dwindling. Combined these dynamics cause us to review our market share assumptions, increasing our forecast share for Intel in the smartphone/tablet markets and reducing the assumed Arm share. This combined with updated foreign exchange assumptions drives 10%/12%/12% downgrades to earnings per share in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. We also note our second quarter estimates are below consensus largely due to lower PD royalties, where we forecast a 14% sequential decline (from fall off of strong Apple and other smartphone chip builds in the third and fourth quarter), whereas consensus looks too optimistic with just a 3% sequential decline. We cut base case forecasts of Arm's CPU share in smartphones to 72% from 86% in 2014 and beyond. Our current thinking is that the balance of 28% goes to Intel, however we believe there are scenarios where Intel could gain up to 40% share if it managed to enable some breakthrough devices at the likes of Sony/Amazon/Motorola, all of which have strong brands and distribution. Since an investor day on 22 May, Arm shares have lost around 22% of their value. As for Imagination, its shares were hit by a downgrade from Barclays which moved from overweight to equal weight with a 300p price target. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 22.23 points higher at 6330.49 as fears eased that the US Federal Reserve meeting could see an easing of its bond buying programme, one of the central bank planks supporting the market in recent months. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: After four consecutive weeks of declines Europe's markets have started the week on the front foot ahead of this week's potentially market moving Fed meeting. Markets are assuming that this week's meeting could well see the Fed lower its economic forecasts in line with recent independent expectations from the IMF, World Bank and OECD, and if they do so it would make it much less likely that we will see any prospect of [easing] any time soon. Vodafone added 2.65p to 182.7p on renewed hopes of consolidation in the mobile sector. This followed reports AT&amp;T was interested in Spain's Telefonica but had been rebuffed, although this was subsequently denied. Vodafone itself is said to be preparing an increased offer for Kabel Deutschland. Elsewhere Resolution rose 8p to 283.1p following news that JP Morgan had raised its target price on the insurer from 273p to 302p, albeit with a neutral rating: Continuing delivery around cost savings and improving market conditions underpin its strong dividend yield of 7.6% versus the sector at 4.0%. Legal and General lost 0.3p to 170.6p despite unveiling a new finance director after almost a year of searching. Since Nigel Wilson moved from the role to become chief executive, L&amp;G has had an interim finance director in the form of Wadham Downing. Now Mark Gregory, a 15 year L&amp;G veteran who is currently head of its savings business, will take on the role with effect from next month. Reports earlier this month suggested regulators were not happy with L&amp;G's initial suggestions for the role. Reckitt Benckiser jumped 100p to \u00a346.79 after a positive note from Citigroup on the Cillit Bang maker. The bank issued a buy note, saying the company's pharmaceutical business was trading at less than half its potential value. It said: We are buyers of Reckitt for the recovery of its core business and for its potential in consumer health. However, we also think [the pharmaceutical business] is under-valued by the market, particularly in light of its early resilience to the recent entry of generic competition in the US Suboxone market. We value Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceutical at \u00a35.2bn, or 710p per share. We think the current share price implies a \u00a32bn valuation, or 275p per share, which our scenario analysis finds too conservative. Reiterate buy \u2013 price target \u00a354.50.

The imbroglio over ERT has shown, as never before, how fragile prime minister Antonis Samaras' uneasy alliance is.</p> <p>At no other time has the conservative leader been felt to have acted in such a high-handed manner, as in delivering the death knell to the state-run broadcaster, without the agreement of his junior left-wing parties. The furore that has followed is as much about them chafing at this as anything else. And Samaras under-estimated the backlash. In seeking a compromise, however (a certainty given pressure from Germany and the start of the tourist season), the ruling coalition will once again also prove how hard it is to solve Greece's mountain of problems. As time passes the country's economic, financial and social difficulties will only grow.</p> <p>\"The goverment is totally dysfunctional. There are just too many accumulated problems, the deficit, the real economy, the recession, privatisations, restructuring of the public sector, for any government to solve,\" says the political analyst Giorgos Kyrtsos. \"The scenario of snap elections happening is no more than 10-15 percent. But whether the government will survive the next six months is another issue. Some other problem will emerge that it can't deal with. I give it an 80 percent chance of collapsing over the winter of 2013-14.\"</p> <p>Samaras has undoubtedly been the big winner of this government winning plaudits far and wide for his handling of Greece in the 12 months to the day since the tri-partite alliance assumed power. But his shock decision to close ERT has been met with as much criticism from conservatives and challenges to his rule from within his own New Democracy party cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>Germany's forthcoming elections have forced a semblance of stability on Greece. Once they are over and Europe's power house is forced to deal with its weakest euro zone partner again, the crisis will intensify. The ERT episode will be but a blip.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Samaras' inner circle are now saying it is not certain that the PM will make a public statement before the meeting.</p> <p>\"A compromise has to be found\" one insider told Helena. \"Are they all so mad as to want to go to elections?

      "bodyText": "PS: more political meetings on Wednesday.... GW The dramatic court ruling from Greece is a good moment to stop the liveblog for the day. I\"ll be back tomorrow morning for all the reaction to the news the ERT must remain open, and the political fallout of tonight's meeting between Antonis Samaras, Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis. In the meantime, here's a very brisk summary of the main points: \u2022 Greece's top court, the Council of State, ruled tonight that the ERT state broadcast must continue to offer a service - six days after the country's government dramatically shut it. The ruling (from 7.57pm onwards) appears to mean that ERT will keep operating until the government's successor, called Nerit, is ready. That probably won't mean a full service, though. \u2022 The ruling came as Greece's three coalition leaders held talks about the closure of ERT, which has gripped Greece for days. Faced with speculation that his government could collapse over the row, prime minister Antonis Samaras offered concessions to his junior partners. That included keeping ERT open with a skeleton staff (a suggestion that has been rather overtaken by the Court ruling), a cabinet reshuffle, and a BBC advisor for the new broadcaster. (see 6.54pm onwards) \u2022 Opposition parties seized on the dispute, with Syriza's Alexis Tsipras giving a rousing speech in Syntagma Square tonight (see 6.51pm) \u2022 While our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, had already warned that the ERT debacle has wounded the coalition (see 3.04pm). Plenty more news and analysis in the liveblog, but until tomorrow, goodnight! Journalist Damian Mac Con Uladh agrees that the court's ruling is an valuable opportunity to build a better state broadcaster in Greece: From Athens, Yannis Koutsomitis explains that the essence of the court's ruling is that a minumum transmission must be restored at ERT to serve the public interest, until a new broadcaster is ready. Greece's government is insisting tonight that it has not been defeated, as ERT will still be replaced by a new broadcaster, Nerit, this summer. Antonis Samaras's office is briefing that the court has merely blocked the 'blackout' at ERT, not the main decision that the state broadcaster must be closed. The BBC's Mark Lowen sums it up: More reaction: In Athens, campaigners are pointing out that ERT \u2013 which had been criticised as biased and riddled with cronyism while it was running \u2013 must now take advantage of this second chance: Here's some more reaction to tonight's news: Big news out of Greece in the last few minutes -- the country's highest court has reportedly ruled that ERT could be kept running until the country's new state broadcaster is up and running. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The court decision has just come through and appears to have saved the day by decreeing that ERT remains extant until new broadcaster is created. That would offer an honourable way out for Samaras. Remarkable timing -- just an hour after prime minister Antonis Samaras proposed keeping ERT running (see 6.54pm onwards). The news was greeted with delight by workers at ERT's headquarters, where services have kept running for nearly a week since the station was officially closed. Another (rumoured) part of Antonis Samaras's new proposals tonight is that a BBC advisor should be brought in to assist with his new broadcaster, Nerit: Based on the various briefings and rumours floating around Greece tonight, it appears that Antonis Samaras's concession boils down to: 1) reversing the decision to shut state broadcaster ERT completely, with a small number of staff (perhaps 200) staying on. 2) appointing a new minister who would be responsible for running ERT until its successor, Nerit, is operational this summer 3) a cabinet reshuffle by the end of the month Here's Reuters latest take: Greece's prime minister has offered to quickly restart state broadcaster ERT under temporary management, a government official said on Monday, in a bid to defuse a political crisis and avoid snaps elections. Samaras made the offer during talks with coalition allies in an effort to bridge a rift over the broadcaster's abrupt closure that plunged Greece into fresh political turmoil, the official said.However, he insists that ERT be restructured and restart as a new, slimmed-down broadcaster, the official said. The official said Samaras also offered to reshuffle his cabinet at the end of June and update the coalition agreement with his allies, the Socialist PASOK and Democratic Left, in a bid to improve cooperation between the three parties. And here's more reaction: More details of the Greek PM's new proposal to hold his coalition together are emerging in Greece's media: Reuters is now quoting a Greek government source who says Antonis Samaras has offered concessions to his coalition partners that would keep ERT running (as we've been suggesting was likely). According the unnamed source, Samaras will allow ERT to restart with 'temporary management', and also reshuffle his government at the end fo June. It's not clear whether the offer has been accepted by Venizelos and Kouvelis. Alexis Tsipras, head of the Syriza party, has kicked off his speech at a crowded Syntagma square saying: The life of this government is over. Democracy is going to return to this country... Mr Samaras with your decision to close public TV you are finished. Whether the three of you come to an agreement tonight or not you are finished. Goodnight Mr Samaras. Efthimia Efthimiou \u200fof @capitalgr tweets more highlights: Images of Pasok's Evangelos Venizelos and Democratic Left's Fotis Kouvelis arriving at tonight's meeting just arrived: Tonight's rally outside ERT's headquarters, organised by the Communist Party, is also underway. It's designed to put more pressure on the Greek prime minister to abandon the closure of the state broadcaster The Syriza party's rally outside the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square is now underway - and here's a photo via Twitter: Much of tonight's Mega news in Greece was focused on the \"unhappiness\" of the government's two junior partners with prime minister Antonis Samaras' \"arrogant\" behaviour. Helena add: As mentioned earlier, there is now widespread speculation that their own bargaining chip will be a full-scale government reshuffle and a promise from the conservative leader not to make decisions \"without considering their own opinions first.\" The meeting, ultimately, might be as much a dressing down of Samaras and his inner circle as an attempt to keep ERT open. Evangelos Venizelos, the socialist Pasok leader who has seen his party's ratings plunge, is particularly excised and has told anyone who will listen that he is \"sticking to his guns\" both with his plan to cull civil servants from other posts and to put Samaras in his place. The irony of this all is that none of the parties want the government to collapse. Early elections would be tountamount to political suicide for all three. As shown by the latest opinion poll data at 4.58pm..... Greece's MEGA TV is reporting that the Greek coalition leaders may agree to a reshuffle as part of a compromise deal tonight, perhaps focusing on ministries which handle economic matters (Helena Smith flags up) Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that all three leaders are now expected to make statements after their meeting. The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will probably make his statement from his official office (having not delivered the TV address which had been rumoured). Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvellis are expected to make statements from their respective party headquarters. Helena adds: People are gathering in Syntagma square to hear far left main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras address the crowds on what has become an almost tragic-comic first anniversary for the coalition government. But, hey, what to expect this is Greece after all? The meeting between Antonis Samaras, Evangelos Venizelos, and Fotis Kouvelis \u2013 the three leaders of the Greek coalition \u2013 has just begun. To quickly recap, the three men are discussing the decision to close Greece's state broadcaster, ERT, nearly a week ago, which sparked protests in Athens and threatens to split their coalition. Samaras insists that ERT must be replaced with a new smaller broadcaster, while Venizelos and Kouvelis argue that ERT must be kept running. There are reports that Venizelos will present an alternative plan at tonight's meeting that would keep ERT running: Back to Greece, and the word from Athens is that the country's top court will soon announce when it will release its ruling on the decision to shut the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) [not the decision itself as we initially thought]. This comes as Greek leaders prepare to start their own talks on the issue, while opposition parties begin their demonstrations in support of ERT. Action stations... Europe's stock markets posted gains today. The message from the City was that traders are not too worried about the Federal Reserve winding in its stimulus measures soon. The FTSE 100 ended 22 points high at 6330, while the French CAC jumped 1.5% and the German DAX gained 1%. My colleague Nick Fletcher's closing market report is here, and covers all the action in the City: FTSE moves higher ahead of Federal Reserve meeting but chip designer Arm misses out Janis A. Emmanouilidis, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, has argued that PM Antonis Samaras could actually come out of this situation in a stronger position -- if he reaches a deal with his coalition partners. Speaking to AP, Emmanouilidis said: There's strong interest from the outside that there is continuity in Greece and stability for some time to come ... So I think the pressure is there... For the smaller coalition partners I think there is the realization that elections are not in their interest either. An opinion poll published on Sunday backs this up. While Samaras's New Democracy was a whisker ahead of the left-wing Syriza party, Pasok were only in fourth place with 6.3% of the vote, behind the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. Democratic Left were languishing in seventh, behind the Communists and the right-wing Independent Greeks Also via Keep Talking Greece, a poster to rally support for ERT: Greek journalists have just halted a strike which began last week in protest at the closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT). The decision will allow them to cover tonight's head-to-head between Samaras, Venizelos and Kouvelis, which is expected to begin at 5.30pm BST (7.30pm local time), showing the importance of the meeting: Keep Talking Greece has more details: Journalists union decided to suspend strike at 6 pm on Monday to follow the crucial Samaras-Venizelos-Kouvelis meeting and inform the public about the outcome. The suspension is planned for 24 hours. Greece\u2019s journalists have been on rolling 24-hour strike since Tuesday, June 11th 2013, when Prime Minister Samaras ordered the sudden shutdown of public broadcaster ERT. However many journalists working for private media did not follow the unions\u2019 decisions. News programs and info magazines were broadcast last night, but also on Monday morning. My colleague Lisa O'Carroll has filed a news story about the situation in Greece. She writes: Party leaders in Greece's ruling coalition are to meet on Monday to try and heal the rift over last week's shutdown of the country's state TV and radio broadcaster as part of a bid to meet the country's bailout obligations. Conservative prime minister Antonis Samaras's fragile three-party coalition, formed to save debt-ridden Greece from bankruptcy this time last yea,r has faced a massive backlash over the decision on 11 June to close ERT, with 2,700 staff put out of work. The ERT closure has prompted two general strikes and drawn criticism from broadcasters in Greece and across Europe. Samaras has refused to turn the \"sinful\" ERT back on, vowing over the weekend to fight to modernise a country he said had become a \"Jurassic Park\" of inefficiency and corruption. His PASOK and Democratic Left government partners, aware that they risk humiliation and the loss of any future say over the coalition, rejected Samaras's offer of a limited restart of broadcasts. The three party leaders are to meet at 4.30pm (GMT) to seek a solution. More here: ERT shutdown: Greek leaders to meet over closure of state broadcaster Political journalist Giannis Pittaras has tweeted that the Greek Council of State will issue its ruling on the ERT close tonight, and demand that the broadcaster remains open Yannis Koutsomitis kindly translates: Nothing official yet, though.... Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith predicts that despite speculation of early elections a compromise will be found at tonight's crucial meeting of coalition leaders. However, political analysts suggest that Samaras's coalition remains vulnerable, and could fall next winter. Helena writes: The government will survive this test but it is profoundly shaken. The imbroglio over ERT has shown, as never before, how fragile prime minister Antonis Samaras' uneasy alliance is. At no other time has the conservative leader been felt to have acted in such a high-handed manner, as in delivering the death knell to the state-run broadcaster, without the agreement of his junior left-wing parties. The furore that has followed is as much about them chafing at this as anything else. And Samaras under-estimated the backlash. In seeking a compromise, however (a certainty given pressure from Germany and the start of the tourist season), the ruling coalition will once again also prove how hard it is to solve Greece's mountain of problems. As time passes the country's economic, financial and social difficulties will only grow. \"The goverment is totally dysfunctional. There are just too many accumulated problems, the deficit, the real economy, the recession, privatisations, restructuring of the public sector, for any government to solve,\" says the political analyst Giorgos Kyrtsos. \"The scenario of snap elections happening is no more than 10-15 percent. But whether the government will survive the next six months is another issue. Some other problem will emerge that it can't deal with. I give it an 80 percent chance of collapsing over the winter of 2013-14.\" Samaras has undoubtedly been the big winner of this government winning plaudits far and wide for his handling of Greece in the 12 months to the day since the tri-partite alliance assumed power. But his shock decision to close ERT has been met with as much criticism from conservatives and challenges to his rule from within his own New Democracy party cannot be ruled out. Germany's forthcoming elections have forced a semblance of stability on Greece. Once they are over and Europe's power house is forced to deal with its weakest euro zone partner again, the crisis will intensify. The ERT episode will be but a blip. And Samaras' inner circle are now saying it is not certain that the PM will make a public statement before the meeting. \"A compromise has to be found\" one insider told Helena. \"Are they all so mad as to want to go to elections? I don't think so.\" The New York stock market has opened higher as Wall Street traders resist panicking ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones is up almost 1%, while most Europe's markets are also still showing gains. Here's the latest prices (unfortunately not including the Athens stock market, which is down around 0.4%) Eurozone crisis commentator Yannis Koutsomitis reports that the leaders of Pasok and Democratic Left will not be speaking to the media straight after their meeting with Samaras tonight about the closure of ERT. Instead, they'll be heading back to their party headquarters - putting the whole affair on more of a war footing... Speaking of the G8, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes that David Cameron and George Osborne are planning a last-ditch push to persuade leaders of the west's leading industrial nations to soften their opposition to plans for a global crackdown on tax evasion. From Northern Ireland, Larry writes: \"We will see where we get to,\" one government source said yesterday. \"It is still unclear, but we are confident of a good outcome. \"It will be significantly better than anyone would have expected six months ago\". More here: G8: Cameron and Osborne to make final push for tax evasion crackdown And our G8 Live blog is here. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has accepted an invitation to visit Greece...... European Council president Herman Van Rompuy has boldly declared that the eurozone's worst days are behind it, as leaders arrive for the G8 meeting in Northern Ireland. Van Rompuy told a press conference at Lough Erne in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, that the euro's future was no longer at risk. He cited the recent rise in exports (as covered at 12.37pm) as proof the economy is healing. Van Rompuy said: The euro is no longer under existential threat, financial stability has been restored, deficits have been halved, competitiveness is improving and as a result exports are picking up. Our economies will come stronger out of the crisis in the eurozone, more integrated. There is no comparison between the situation today and the situation nine months ago, when the euro was under existential threat. That is not the case any more. Not quite as bold as Francois Hollande's claim earlier this month that the eurozone crisis was over. The G8 Summit will probably be dominated by the conflict in Syria, David Cameron's hopes for tax reform, and the Guardian's latest revelations today that British security monitored the computers and mobile phones of some foreign politicians and officials at a G20 summit in 2009. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging the event here here: G8 summit: Politics live blog. Another tweet pointing out that it's the first anniversary of the 2012 Greek election: Meanwhile, ERT staff continues to broadcast their services despite being 'closed' six days ago. Here's a fresh photo of an employee entering one of its radio studios in Athens today. Now this is interesting... the European Commission was reportedly considering legal action against Greece's state broadcaster, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (or ERT) when the organisation was suddenly closed. According to Public Service Europe, Brussels was unhappy that ERT dropped broadcasts of the multi-lingual Euronews channel, which the EC subsidises. Despite losing a court case earlier this year, ERT was dragging its feet on restarting Euronews broadcasts, which meant Commissioner Viviane Reding was mulling legal action when Antonis Samaras rather took matters into his own hands. Reding told a Greek MEP last Tuesday that she was currently analysing the potential scope for action at EU level as regards the cessation of terrestrial transmission of Euronews in Greece. Just hours later, ERT's closure was announced. No suggestion that the EC connived in ERT's closure (which Samaras had discussd with political allies the previous weekend), but it might explain why Brussels didn't shout louder last week. More here. More economic news \u2013 the eurozone posted a smaller-than-expected trade surplus in April, although exports were still almost 10% higher than a year ago. Euro nations ran a combined trade surplus of almost \u20ac15bn during the month, lower than March's \u20ac22.9bn and some way short of economist forecasts. Exports were down by 0.8% month-on-month in April, while imports picked up by 0.5%. But compared to April 2012, the eurozone exported 9% more while only importing 1% more. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said it was a \"decent\" performance, especially as the eurozone periphery all achieved better figures than a year ago. Archer said: It is notable that all of the struggling Eurozone periphery countries saw improved trade performances year-on-year in the first quarter of 2013, particularly Spain, but also Italy, Portugal and Greece. This was significantly due to weakened domestic demand leading to year-on-year falls in imports. However, it is encouraging that that Spain and Greece also achieved export growth, which suggests that they are benefiting from improved competitiveness due to the reduction in their labour costs. While SocGen's Kit Juckes pointed to the underlying slump in the eurozone this year: In other news, German wages appear to have jumped this year, with nominal hourly labour costs rising by 3.9% in the first quarter of 2013. That is more than double the eurozone average of 1.6%, Eurostat reported. That may be a sign of Germany inflating, and could mean consumers paying for more imports from the rest of the eurozone.... Antonis Samaras, Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis will be battling to hold the Greek coalition government together when they meet tonight, Associated Press warns. Here's AP's take on the situation: Party leaders in Greece's ruling coalition are trying to heal the rift over the closure of the country's state TV and radio broadcaster that is threatening to topple the government and compromise the country's bailout program. Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is to meet later Monday with the leaders of two center-left parties in the year-old coalition. Both leaders have strongly opposed the prime minister's decision last week to shut down the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp. or ERT. Shares on the Athens Stock Exchange were 2.5 percent lower ahead of the meeting expected after 6:00 p.m. (15.00 GMT). ERT staff has continued unauthorized live programming since the June 11 closure, backed by European Broadcasting Union which represents public TV and radio stations across the continent. The US stock market is expected to follow Europe's positive lead when trading begins at 2.30pm BST (8.30am local time). The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up almost 1%: Also coming up tonight... the Left-wing Syriza party is holding a rally in Syntagma Square tonight, where leader Alexis Tsipras will give a speech at 8pm. Syriza has dubbed the ERT closure an example of Antonis Samaras's 'authoritarian' instincts, so we can expect more fiery talk from Tsipras tonight. The petition brought by workers from ERT against the station's closure is now being heard by Greece's highest court, the Council of State: Potentially, the Council could rule that ERT should keep running while it makes a full decision on the legality of its closure. Looking back at Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras is still expected to deliver a TV speech tonight before he begins crucial talks with his coalition partners from 7.30pm local time, or 5.30pm BST. Samaras may be feeling stronger after Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, telephoned him yesterday to express her support. Merkel told Samaras that it was \"of clear importance to push through all troika agreements, including those with regard to the reform of the public service.\" Shutting ERT will cost over 2,000 civil service jobs, helping to meet targets set by Greece's lenders. There is speculation that Samaras's speech tonight will be transmitted under the branding of Nerit, the government's proposed successor to ERT (coloured bands appeared on formerly blank screens over the weekend, suggesting the service was limbering up). That could be problematic, legally, as the legislation creating Nerit hasn't been passed. Some critics suggest such a broadcast would breach broadcasting rules.... And here's some more reaction to the situation in Greece today: In other City news, veteran fund manager Anthony Bolton has announced his retirement this morning, with more of a whimper than a bang. Bolton will leave the scene in 2014 with his once-glittering reputation scuffed by the launch of his Fidelity China Special Situations fund three years ago. It never matched the runaway success of his original Special Situations fund, prompting Bolton to apologise to investors after the fund's value fell by a third. Mark Dampier, head of Investment Research at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that the China fund did perform better last year, but had only grown by 2.1% since 2010: Anthony has had a fantastic career; he is rightly regarded as one of the best active managers of recent decades. His China fund\u2019s performance in recent years has tarnished this record slightly, though it has shown signs of recovery in the past year. The big financial news in London this morning is that the Co-operative Bank is being rescued in a deal that will see its bondholders suffer losses. Under the plan, institutions and individuals who held the bank's junior bonds will be 'bailed-in' to the rescue, with their debt swapped for new shares. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: The \"bail in\" is a new method for helping banks raise capital and allows the Co-op to avoid having to raid other parts of its business or turn to the taxpayer to plug the shortfall which has already forced it to stop lending to big corporations. It is a blow to the mutual sector \u2013 Co-op Group is the largest in the UK \u2013 which the government had been targeting for growth. The Co-op bank, which has 4.7 million customers, will raise \u00a31bn this year and another \u00a3500m next year through the bail in and selling off its insurance operations. The bank said that 5% of the bonds affected \u2013 which pay high rates of interest \u2013 were held by retail investors whose average investment was \u00a31,000 each. The precise detail of their losses may not become clear until full details of the \"exchange offer\" are published before October. Here's Jill's full story: Co-operative Bank to list on stock market in rescue deal New trade data shows that Italy posted a trade surplus in April, mainly due to shrinking imports as the country's recession continued. ISTAT reported that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the amount of goods imported into Italy fell by 0.9% month-on-month, while exports were unchanged compared with March. The trade surplus, of \u20ac1.9bn, compares with a \u20ac250m deficit a year ago (but is smaller than March's \u20ac3.2bn surplus). Exports were 4.4% higher than in April 2012, while imports are down by 2.6%. Here's Istat's full statement (pdf). Stock markets in Europe are up in early trading, after a decent day in Asia. Japan's Nikkei scampered out of 'bear market' territory, gaining 2.7%. This puts the index just 18% below last month's high. The bounceback from Thursday's 6.35% plunge came as the yen weakened, hitting \u00a595 against the dollar. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explained that the Nikkei had rallied \"as the yen came back under pressure, helping the exporting stocks.\" Here's the stuation in Europe: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 42 points at 6350, +0.67% \u2022 German DAX: up109 points at 8237, + 1.35% \u2022 French CAC: up 48 points at 3853, +1.3% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 47 points at 8119, +0.6% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: flat at 16152. And as mentioned already, Wednesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee continues to loom over the markets. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale sums it up: All eyes are on the FOMC meeting and accompanying press conference (policy announcement on Wednesday at 19:00 BST, press conference 19:30)..... Following market volatilty...the general expectation is that Ben Bernanke will calm fears of over-zealous \u2018tapering'. Still, the case for beginning the process of letting some air out of the monetary bubble - is pretty clear and surely the Fed will be wary of backing down too easily. Those exasperated by the constant discussion of the Fed's next move must suffer a few days longer... Opinion polls released over the weekend showed that nearly two-thirds of Greeks diapproved of the closure of ERT. However, a majority of those polled also said they did not want new general elections. The polls also found that Samaras's New Democracy party held a tiny lead of the left-wing Syriza group, but without enough support to govern alone. Details here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Greece's government remains in crisis mode today as the political row sparked by the closure of state broadcaster ERT continues to grip the country. The heads of the three parties in its coalition are due to hold talks this afternoon over the issue, nearly a week after the shock decision to shut ERT was made. The junior leaders in prime minister Antonis Samaras's coalition, Pasok's Evangelos Venizelos and Democratic Left's Fotis Kouvelis, have already rejected the PM's proposal to keep a cut-down ERT news service running with a skeleton staff. Can a deal be reached tonight when the three men meet? It's exactly 12 months since the (second) Greek election of 2012, which deilvered Samaras to power. But the ERT debacle has reignited the instability and confusion that the centre-right leader's administration was meant to leave behind. Samaras raised the stakes yesterday, telling a party conference that Pasok and Democratic Left has agreed to the closure of ERT, only to oppose it once the backlash began. He said: The elimination of 2,000 public sector jobs between now and June was signed up to by all the heads of the three parties of the governing coalition From where should we cut these jobs apart from the undeserving ERT \u2026 one of the bastions of obscurity and privileges? Samaras also rejected the suggestion that the crisis could precipitate early elections. There are reports that he will give a TV address tonight: In another twist, Greece's Council of State (the top court) is due to issue a provisional ruling today early this week on an appeal brought from ERT staff. Judges might order the broadcaster to resume service until a final verdict is issued \u2013 which would provide a way out of the mess. Elsewhere today, the financial markets are pretty calm. Traders continue to have at least one eye pointed at Wednesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee, when we might get a better clue about when Fed will start to slow its stimulus programme. I'll be tracking events in Greece and beyond through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Note to Euan Sutherland, chief executive of the Co-op Group: when you are imposing losses on bondholders in your bank, including 7,000 retail investors, at least be apologetic. Sutherland danced around the houses when pressed about the fact of the losses on Radio 5 , even pointing out that some non-City bondholders have held their investment for many years and thus have had their original capital returned via coupon payments. Come on, a haircut is a haircut, and in this case it is likely to be substantial \u2013 perhaps as much as 30% of the face value of the bonds when the final terms are decided. In similar breezy fashion, the official eight-page announcement of the rescue plan didn't find space to mention why the Co-op Bank finds itself short of \u00a31.5bn of core capital, a colossal sum given the size of the organisation. The explanation, of course, is simple: the Co-op should never have merged its bank with Britannia Building Society in 2009. The latter brought a heap of rotten assets, including commercial property loans struck at the top of an over-blown credit market. So the short version of the story is this: the bondholders are paying for the empire-building mistakes of past Co-op directors. Sutherland, as the new boy recruited to sort out the mess, has no reason to be coy on the point. Maybe he was reflecting the sense of shock with the Co-op, and the wider mutual movement. A few months ago, former chief executive Peter Marks was boasting that the deal to purchase 632 branches from Lloyds was a bargain that would propel Co-op Bank into banking's premier league. Then the Verde deal with Lloyds collapsed, Co-op Bank's debt was downgraded to junk and now the bank will be dragged into a stock listing, albeit with the Co-op Group retaining majority ownership. It should still be possible to retain the bank's mutual spirit for customers, but life will be different behind the scenes. There are, apparently, instances of mutuals on the continent who have external shareholders but that has never been the way in the UK. This marriage born of necessity will take some managing. The next step is to announce a dividend policy and give the new crew of minority shareholders confidence that their rights will be respected. Still, the bail-in itself qualifies as a reasonably fair distribution of pain. The capital black hole had to be filled somehow and \u00a3500m from bondholders, plus \u00a31bn from the Co-op Group, is an acceptable fudge. The alternative was much worse \u2013 nationalisation of the bank and an even greater hit for bondholders. So, yes, the bondholders do have reasons to be grateful. But they should also be a given a detailed post-mortem on how the Britannia disaster happened, as should the Co-op's 7.6 million members. The group board at the time was 34-strong. Were there dissenters who spotted the risks? Or were all directors consumed by the supposed glory of creating a \"super mutual\" in banking? The newly arrived collection of directors, including Richard Pym and Niall Booker, bring much-needed expertise in banking. But fundamental questions about boardroom accountability at the Co-op still need to be answered. Is democracy working effectively? For the regulators, Monday's outcome is a qualified triumph. The plus point is evidence that the new philosophy of \"bailing in\" bondholders to spare the state's coffers can be made to work. In the post-crisis world, two troubled organisations have now been re-organised successfully (the other was Dunfermline Building Society, where the Nationwide played the role of saviour). Jolly good. Whether a bondholder bail-in could be orchestrated in practice at a much larger crisis-ridden bank is an open question; but at least it has worked this time. The negative is the fact that the Co-op Bank's capital deficiency has been an open secret for a year and yet the Verde farce was allowed to run. Indeed, the ringmaster had been the Treasury. David Davis, Tory MP, is right to demand that the Treasury should explain its role in the Verde bidding process. The deal became a totem of the coalition government's claim to be committed to greater competition and diversity in banking. The ambition was noble, we might all agree, but if the government is going to interfere it should do so competently. The Co-op Bank will be saved under this plan and may yet prosper again.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's best-known fund manager, Anthony Bolton of Fidelity, is to retire next year with his reputation as a legendary investor \"tarnished\" by the relative failure of his \u00a3460m China fund. Bolton, 63, will step down in April 2014 and be replaced by Dale Nicholls, currently manager of Fidelity's Pacific funds. Known as the kingmaker in several multibillion pound City deals, Bolton shot to fame in 2003 when he orchestrated the sacking of Michael Green, then chief executive of Carlton Communications, earning him a title he loathes: the Quiet Assassin. He became the most successful investor of his generation, with his Special Situations fund earning a huge and loyal following among small investors. But his China Special Situations fund, which raised \u00a3460m amid huge fanfare in 2010, has failed to repeat that success. Nearly 100,000 investors who bought at \u00a31 a share \u2013 and saw some of that go to financial advisers in a much-criticised commission deal \u2013 are still nursing losses of 14% three years later, with the trust currently trading at 86p a share. In April 2010 Bolton hailed China as the \"investment opportunity of the next decade\" but the performance of the country's stock market has been poor almost ever since. The China fund sector is the worst performing of all sectors in the past three years, registering a loss of 0.6%. This compares, for example, with gains of 40% for UK equity funds, 39% for US equities and 35% for European equities. \"Worse still is that Bolton's trust has significantly under-performed many other Chinese funds,\" said Patrick Connolly of advisers Chase de Vere, adding \"we never recommended it to our clients.\" Last year Bolton said he would extend his time in Hong Kong in a bid to reverse the losses suffered by small investors in his trust. In recent months, the performance of the trust has improved, rising from a low of 71p in September 2012 and even touched its launch price of 100p before falling back again as markets worldwide have dipped. After his retirement in April 2014, Bolton will continue as an adviser to Fidelity and a trustee of its charitable foundations. Mark Dampier, head of investment research at Hargreaves Lansdown, which was among the promoters of the fund, said: \"Anthony has had a fantastic career; he is rightly regarded as one of the best active managers of recent decades. His China fund's performance in recent years has tarnished this record slightly, though it has shown signs of recovery in the past year.\" Little is known of Bolton's own personal fortune. As an employee, he has shared in the income stream from the funds, which in the case of the China fund is worth around \u00a35-6m a year. But his personal wealth is much greater, and tied up in his holdings of 'career shares' in the group. Fidelity is a privately held company, still effectively controlled by the Johnson family, who founded the firm in the US in 1949. Bolton joined Fidelity's UK operation in 1979, and was among the few senior managers to be invited to buy shares in the company, which will now be worth many millions of pounds. These do not vest in their entirety until the senior manager departs.",

He said: The net proceeds are expected to be \u00a3585m, used for incremental capital expenditure (around \u00a3200m over 4 years) and net debt reduction (around \u00a3385m). Whilst the net debt reduction was critical to address the credit rating, the long-dated nature of the debt means that gross debt reduction and interest cost savings are limited. Despite the more solid balance sheet increasing the ability for management to restructure, we still have concerns over plans for more bolt-on acquisitions in the capital intense US bus business, whilst ongoing cash generation remains the big unknown. Margin recovery expectations are already high, whilst bus service operator grant subsidies remain a risk. We would wait for some delivery on targets before becoming constructive.",
