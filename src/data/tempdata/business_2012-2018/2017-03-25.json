      "bodyText": "Campaigners and telecoms industry insiders have renewed calls for the government to cap the fees charged by directory service numbers in the wake of three-figure bills racked up by customers for a single call. A report in the Observer\u2019s Cash pages today reveals how a 90-year-old woman was billed \u00a3501 after a directory inquiries number-finding service, operated by Telecom2, tried repeatedly to connect her to her requested number at a cost of \u00a37.99 a minute. The 118 004 number was the UK\u2019s most expensive directory inquiries service and has now been withdrawn after pressure from the Observer. But the case has highlighted the extraordinary charges such companies can impose, after the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, opted out of putting a cap on such fees. Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer campaign website moneysavingexpert.com, described the prices of unregulated 118 numbers as disgraceful. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s the elderly who don\u2019t have access to the internet who tend to use these services and they deserve far better protection.\u201d Ofcom announced restrictions to charges for premium rate and non-geographical business numbers in a review in 2015, but ditched proposals to limit fees for 118 directory services. \u201cOfcom took the view that there was no consumer harm, but we disagree,\u201d said Cathy Gerosa, head of regulatory affairs at the Federation of Communication Services, which represents telecoms companies. \u201cPeople can run up huge bills without realising it and Ofcom should be capping prices.\u201d The average cost of calling a 118 number has soared 17-fold to \u00a36.98 since the directory inquiries industry was deregulated in 2003. Callers who agree to be connected to their requested number continue to be charged per minute throughout the subsequent call. On top of that, the caller\u2019s own service provider adds an access charge of up to 55p a minute, bringing the cost of a 10-minute call via the most popular 118 118 service to \u00a349 from a mobile phone. Last year Ofcom agreed to allow 118 service providers to charge a flat fee of up to \u00a315.98 a call plus \u00a37.99 a minute. Telecom2 is the only operator to have taken advantage of that price band, according to the premium rate watchdog Phone-paid Services Authority, which is investigating complaints. Telecom2, which has now refunded the 90-year-old, declined to comment but this month, following an Observer investigation, it replaced its 118 004 service with a number that charges below the market average. Ofcom, which admits that it bowed to pressure from 118 providers in its 2015 review, has told the Observer that it would reconsider a crackdown. \u201cWe are carefully monitoring the impact of the adoption of these new higher charges and are actively considering whether further action is justified,\u201d said a spokesperson.",

      "bodyText": "Who is under greater pressure \u2013 the coach of a footy team at the beginning of a season, or the treasurer putting together a budget? This weekend many across the nation will be filled with a sense of promise of things to come. The AFL men\u2019s season has begun, and those like me who spend rather inordinate amounts of time thinking about footy now join their NRL and rugby brethren wondering if the hopes of summer will transform into reality by spring. For AFL fans, this off-season has been wonderfully amended. By the time you are reading this, the first AFL women\u2019s grand final will have been decided. As an Adelaide Crows fan, I am for the first time ever hoping the Crows will be known as \u201cMarch Premiers\u201d. But with the women\u2019s final over, the switch to the men\u2019s competition and with it desires for a premiership will begin again. With that desire comes the pressures on those running the clubs. Thre is already talk of which coaches are most in need of success. Does two years without playing in the finals mean Port Adelaide\u2019s Ken Hinkley is in trouble? Can Nathan Buckley go six years without winning a premiership and survive? The pressure is on the coaches to deliver, and deliver soon. In the NRL, Wests Tigers coach Jason Taylor was dumped after just three rounds. Scott Morrison may not be under the pump to quite the same level, but you don\u2019t see reports about looming cabinet reshuffles and talk of him being sidelined when all is going well. And it comes in the run up to a rather odd budget. It is Morrison\u2019s second budget, so in a sense a continuation of his economic narrative, but it is the fourth of the Abbott-Turnbull government, so at a point where there should be signs of good progress being made. It is also the first budget of this election cycle. The standard tactic after winning an election is to deliver a \u201ctough budget\u201d \u2013 one that is full of \u201chard choices\u201d that need to be made for the \u201cgood\u201d of the economy, and which will deliver benefits before the government next faces the polls. But this was the formula Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott followed in 2014 and it ended disastrously. It was a budget so poorly designed, framed and argued that it set both Hockey and Abbott along the path to their demise. And this is the problem for governments when dealing with budgets. Too easily they (and indeed the media) can fall into the trap of seeing them as political statements which are supposed to conform with the narrative of being a \u201ctough budget\u201d or perhaps one that \u201cbrings home the bacon\u201d. The narrative is a seductive thing \u2013 almost as seductive as footy fans reassuring themselves that early losses with a young team are fine because they are building for the future and all will come good eventually. Politicians and political journalists can be seduced by the budget narrative and get carried away with whether or not a budget has delivered the goods to set it on a path to re-election. But such thinking leads to the belief, such as that expressed by Joe Hockey in his valedictory speech about the 2014 budget, that \u201cthe Abbott government was good at policy but struggled with politics.\u201d In reality, it struggled with politics because it was bad at policy. For Scott Morrison the pressure in this budget \u201cpre-season\u201d has been to deliver (as ever) for families, with the greatest focus on housing affordability. Already the waters have been tested with suggestions such as allowing first-home buyers dip into their superannuation \u2013 a policy that has met with rather tepid response (to say the least), and yet appears to still be a chance to feature in the budget. But as do footy coaches, treasurers also have to deal with armchair experts \u2013 those who played in years past and who still think the old ways are the best. Morrison has no shortage of advice from those on his side of politics such as former Howard government adviser, Niki Savva, who this week suggested the way to tackle housing affordability was to dump the $40bn worth of company tax cuts and instead cut income taxes. If there is one reason to have sympathy for Morrison it is that the conservative side of both politics and the media still believe that the style of budgets delivered by Howard and Costello during a mining boom remain good politics and policy. As such, he is set the task of cutting taxes and spending, reducing the deficit and also delivering a political win. But as even Donald Trump is finding out, talk of winning is all nice and well, but once you introduce a policy that affects people\u2019s livelihoods, they don\u2019t care so much about the sales job or the narrative. Cutting government services under the guise of cutting waste works a lot better when people\u2019s incomes are rising and job security is high. At the moment, we have record low wage growth, full-time employment lower now than it was 12 months ago and the unemployment rate rising. The government will attempt to write a narrative for this budget, but it must be, above al,l focused on good policy. A housing affordability policy is no good if it is there only to fit the narrative rather than actually fix the problem. And it would do well to remember that the mining boom years are over, and what amounts to good policy \u2013 regardless of what the old warriors might think \u2013 has changed. A budget that treats growth as though that\u2019s all that matters and ignores inequality is bad policy that will, as was the case for Joe Hockey, see Morrison quickly take on a new narrative \u2013 that of a coach under pressure to keep his job.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The human and economic cost of Brexit is registered in nationalities and jobs, a list of accents and tasks that we have taken for granted: the Italian chef; the Romanian fruit-picker and the Polish builder. According to industry groups and business owners, it is becoming increasingly hard to attract this kind of employee to Britain because of the collapse in the pound. The slump in sterling since 23 June last year is eroding potential earnings, and uncertainty over the eventual status of EU nationals has not helped. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s continental workforce is holding another referendum, but this time with its feet. For instance, a record number of nurses from the EU are already quitting the NHS, it emerged last week. The haemorrhaging of foreign staff is being blamed on Theresa May\u2019s failure to offer assurances to EU workers living in the UK. It is likely to get worse once the prime minister has triggered article 50 \u2013 expected on Wednesday \u2013 to kickstart the two-year process for Britain to leave the EU. Official figures reveal that the number of EU-born workers in the UK fell by 50,000 between October and December to 2.3 million, in a decline led by people working in banking, the public sector and construction. A shortage of labour is starting to be felt across the economy, from construction, farming and manufacturing to care homes, hotels and restaurants. While the number of EU nationals leaving is limited at present, many businesses, according to the Bank of England, are having trouble hiring from abroad. Some are renting houses for employees or providing minibuses to ferry people to work, as ways of attracting desperately needed staff. Amid fears that the trickle of departing European workers will become a flood, the search is on for solutions. One of them is investment in a phenomenon that will dominate all discussion of jobs and pay in the years to come: automation. Thinktank the Resolution Foundation says sectors that are heavily reliant on lower-paid migrant workers, such as agriculture, construction and food manufacturing, could invest more in machinery and robotics to fill the employment gap. This should lead to productivity \u2013 output per hour worked \u2013 rising and taking pay up with it, achieving one of Philip Hammond\u2019s more elusive goals. But other industries will need to train more British employees to plug the gap, which could take several years. \u201cEmployers need to start preparing now,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. Last week the latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s agents, who toured the country between late November and late February talking to hundreds of businesses, found that construction, engineering, distribution, IT, healthcare and catering \u201cmost often reported hiring difficulties\u201d. They found that some EU workers had left because the fall in sterling had reduced the value of earnings they send home. \u201cHowever, there were more reports of difficulties recruiting new EU migrant workers, due to a shrinking pool of candidates.\u201d Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, echoed those findings. \u201cSome of our members have reported it is becoming harder to hire chefs from outside the UK, as many are being put off by the government\u2019s unwillingness to confirm the rights of EU citizens already living [here].\u201d Workforces in hotels and restaurants, manufacturers and transport are made up, respectively, of 33%, 23% and 20% non-UK nationals, according to human resources consultancy Mercer, where partner Gary Simmons says Brexit is taking place on top of a four-year decline in numbers of British-born workers. He says: \u201cSince 2013, the UK-born workforce has been declining as people retire, and we can see how reliant certain industries are on overseas workers filling the gaps. The UK is likely to impose more stringent migration controls... Every company in every sector in the UK will be competing for a reduced pool of available workers.\u201d Arcadis, a construction consultancy, says the end of free movement of labour and the introduction of a visa system could easily add hundreds of thousands of pounds to individual companies\u2019 costs. At Arcadis alone, 5% of a 4,000-strong UK workforce hail from the EU. Assuming a three-year visa cost of \u00a33,000 plus the Home Office\u2019s new skills surcharge of \u00a31,000 a year, this would mean hiring 200 EU workers would come with a \u00a31.2m bill. Hiring a chef, a fruit-picker or a builder is about to get more expensive. These are the UK sectors most affected by Brexit and its impact on the workforce. Farming Total workers: 385,000 UK-born: 328,000 EU-born: 30,000 Non-EU-born: 27,000 British fruit farmers have been able to recruit enough seasonal workers for this summer, but have had fewer applicants to choose from. Laurence Olins, chairman of trade body British Summer Fruits (BSF), said that where a job previously attracted 10 applicants, this year there were only three or four. \u201cThere is less choice for employers. We may get the numbers but not the quality we had before,\u201d he says. According to Olins, the main culprit is the 12% fall in sterling against the euro since the Brexit vote. \u201cThey [EU workers] are suffering a big pay cut, even though pay has gone up with the increase in the living wage, because it converts to less in euros. We are in big competition with European countries like Germany and Holland, where there are no currency issues.\u201d The fruit-farming industry employs 29,000 seasonal workers, who go back to their home countries after six to nine months in the UK. Virtually all of them come from the EU, mainly Romania and Bulgaria, but also Poland and Hungary. Horticulture overall relies on 85,000 seasonal workers. \u201cWe are very concerned about 2018 and 2019,\u201d Olins added. \u201cThere is no scheme being put in place, but we have to live one year at a time.\u201d The National Farmers\u2019 Union is pushing for a special visa system for seasonal workers on farms. BSF warns that growers could otherwise sell up and move their operations to France or elsewhere in the EU. Hotels and restaurants Total workers: 1.9 million UK-born 1.3 million EU-born 265,000 Non-EU-born 369,000 Hotels, cafes and restaurants rely heavily on non-UK workers. Just one in 50 applicants for jobs at Pret A Manger is British, and the sandwich chain has said it would suffer a staff shortage if it had to turn its back on EU nationals. Denis O\u2019Donnell, who owns the Peruga restaurant in Stockport in Cheshire, has already felt the pinch. He says: \u201cThere has been a massive surge in demand for kitchen staff, and almost zero response to ads.\u201d He recounts that at the last meeting of the British Hospitality Association, \u201cpeople were doing a lot of handwringing and saying: we can\u2019t get chefs\u201d. He adds that people are going to \u201cridiculous lengths\u201d to get staff, like renting houses and bussing them in. The obvious answer, he says, would be to pay higher wages to attract good staff, and he reckons that pay will gradually go up as Brexit becomes a reality. He jokes that if chefs were paid \u00a3100,000 \u2013 double what a head chef currently earns in London \u2013 they would still come to Britain. In the past, a lot of chefs would come from Spain and Italy, but eastern Europeans have become more common in recent times. O\u2019Donnell employs 24 people, including 10 full-time staff. Of those, four are EU nationals: an Italian husband and wife team, one of whom is ma\u00eetre d\u2019; plus a Latvian and a Hungarian kitchen porter. He says these two are \u201cgood, solid, reliable guys in their 60s. You won\u2019t get English guys in their 60s doing this job.\u201d Construction Total workers: 2.4 million UK-born: 2.1 million EU-born: 192,000 Non-EU-born 201,000 The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) says the construction industry could lose more than 175,000 employees \u2013 or 8% of the sector\u2019s workforce \u2013 if the UK loses access to the European single market. This could put key projects, such as the HS2 rail link between London, the Midlands and northern England, at risk. Bellway, a major housebuilder, warned last week that the construction industry\u2019s dependence on overseas workers could make it difficult to tackle Britain\u2019s housing shortage if there were an exodus of EU workers. Ted Ayres, chief executive of the Newcastle-based builder, said: \u201cThe big thing for the construction industry is we have a reliance on overseas labour. Will it [article 50] have any impact on people not wanting to live in the UK or will it stop further people coming to the UK to help us meet the housing demand? We\u2019re not going to be able to build the number of units completely off the UK workforce.\u201d At Bellway and other housebuilders, about 70% of the workforce on London sites are from abroad. Several major housebuilders are understood to be concerned that some EU workers have not returned after the Christmas break. Rob Tincknell, chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, recently told the Times that one housebuilder had 15,000 workers on site before Christmas and only 11,000 came back after the break. A spokesman for Redrow, another big housebuilder, says its workforce is \u201ca real league of nations. We are not seeing panic or a great exodus, but there is no room for complacency. It\u2019s something we need to keep an eye on.\u201d Manufacturing Total workers: 3.4 million UK-born: 2.6 million EU-born: 362,000 Non-EU born: 417,000 EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, has also reported some EU workers going home for Christmas and not coming back. The food and drink industry, the largest UK manufacturing sector, employs 115,000 EU nationals. Ian Wright, director general at the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), says members reported in a survey at the end of last year that their EU employees felt \u201cunwanted and uncomfortable\u201d. One in 12 manufacturers with EU employees had said some of their workers were planning to leave the UK. Wright adds: \u201cOur members have also said they\u2019re having difficulty recruiting EU nationals for certain roles. We face a skills gap, and require access to these employees to remain competitive. They are vital to keeping the UK fed. If you can\u2019t feed a country, you haven\u2019t got a country.\u201d Health and social care Total workers: 4.4 million UK-born: 3.7 million EU-born: 217,000 Non-EU-born: 430,000 Fears are growing that Brexit will lead to a staffing crisis in health and social care. A record number of nurses from the EU is leaving the NHS, and the number of EU nationals registering as nurses in England has plunged 92% since the referendum. And pressures will only grow, because a third of doctors plan to retire by 2020. Care homes, where underfunding and recruitment problems have reached crisis levels, are also hugely reliant on EU-born workers. Their number shot up by more than 40% between December 2013 and September 2016 to 92,000, the most recent date for which figures are available. European workers make up 7% of a social care workforce of 1.34 million (in London the proportion is 12%). Professor Martin Green, chief executive of trade body Care England, said small numbers of EU-born care workers were leaving, but the real issue was recruiting new staff. When a recruitment drive for nurses was conducted in Portugal a week after the June referendum, half the candidates withdrew their applications. More recruitment drives are planned but, he says, it\u2019s made difficult by the weakness of the pound. \u201cAt one stage it was \u20ac1.4 [to the pound] and it was really advantageous [for EU citizens] to be here, but those days are gone,\u201d Green adds. \u201cIf I\u2019m in Poland, I can get to Germany in a couple of hours. It used to be worth my while going to the UK because I was getting more money, but now it\u2019s not.\u201d The social care system lacks the funds to pay higher salaries, which means many Britons don\u2019t want to work in care homes. \u201cGovernment needs to come up with a clear long-term strategy. If it doesn\u2019t, it will have a massive problem in the NHS.\u201d Green says the care sector should be spared the apprenticeship levy \u2013 which charges businesses 0.5% of their annual pay bill \u2013 and should be granted relaxations in the work permit regime for non-UK workers.",

One of them is investment in a phenomenon that will dominate all discussion of jobs and pay in the years to come: automation. Thinktank the Resolution Foundation says sectors that are heavily reliant on lower-paid migrant workers, such as agriculture, construction and food manufacturing, could invest more in machinery and robotics to fill the employment gap. This should lead to productivity \u2013 output per hour worked \u2013 rising and taking pay up with it, achieving one of Philip Hammond\u2019s more elusive goals.

      "bodyText": "Nuclear energy faces an uncertain future globally as concerns over safety and cost dog the industry. But in the UK, foreign investors are queueing up to back projects. The latest is South Korea. Its biggest power company is in talks to join the consortium backing a nuclear power station in Cumbria, in a sign of the continuing allure of Britain\u2019s atomic ambitions to international companies. Kepco said last week it was interested in taking a stake in NuGen, which is 60% owned by Japan\u2019s Toshiba and 40% by France\u2019s Engie, confirming what had been an open secret in the industry for months. Kepco\u2019s president, Cho Hwan-eik, said that once the terms of a potential deal were ironed out, \u201cwe will be the first to jump into the race\u201d. The idea of a Seoul-based company developing the Moorside plant near Sellafield is not as strange as it might seem. The UK government needs new nuclear power stations to meet greenhouse-gas reduction targets and keep the lights on as ageing coal and atomic plants are retired. This month, officials reiterated how important nuclear will be to Britain\u2019s future energy security, with projections that showed 38% of power coming from nuclear by 2035, up from 24% last year. Potential investors have been drawn by the UK government\u2019s enthusiasm and a nuclear standstill elsewhere, amid lingering safety fears in the wake of the Fukushima disaster and cost overruns at the Flamanville site in France which is using a new reactor design. As a result, South Korea has joined Japan, China and France in showing interest in British nuclear. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. We are the only people building new nuclear power stations and we have by far the biggest new nuclear programme outside China for the next 10 years,\u201d said Peter Atherton, an analyst at consultancy Cornwall Energy. \u201cThe civil nuclear programme globally doesn\u2019t have any orders.\u201d One expert, Mycle Schneider, called the UK the \u201clast hope\u201d for the nuclear construction giants of the world. The Paris-based nuclear consultant said: \u201cIn Korea the political situation will dramatically change after the upcoming elections, [probably] not in favour of the nuclear industry. Success overseas will help survival at home. The Japanese industry clearly has no future at home and little prospects abroad [because of Fukushima].\u201d The UK has also dangled the prospect of economic support for foreign nuclear builders. French state-owned EDF, which is building two new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset at a cost of \u00a318bn, struck a subsidy contract with the government that will see it guaranteed twice the wholesale price of electricity for 35 years. The deal means Hinkley would be an \u201cabsolute goldmine\u201d when operational, Atherton said. He said UK financial support was not dissimilar to the deal Kepco has in the United Arab Emirates, where it is building four new reactors paid for by the UAE\u2019s state-owned utility. \u201cThe economics of the project, and the economic risks of the project, fall on the host government,\u201d said Atherton. There is also the prospect that the UK government could take a stake in one of the new nuclear sites. Leaks to Japanese media revealed officials in London and Tokyo had discussed the UK offering state finance to a project led by Japan\u2019s Hitachi to build reactors next to the site of an old one at Wylfa in Wales. Another lure for foreign companies is the prestige of having their reactor design pass the UK\u2019s strict regulatory and licensing process. Antony Froggatt, a nuclear expert at the thinktank Chatham House, said: \u201cIt gives you that important status for getting orders elsewhere.\u201d That is particularly true of the Chinese state-owned company, which is providing a third of the money for Hinkley and whose design for a reactor at Bradwell, Essex is expected to complete the UK regulatory process in 2021. \u201cIt would be important because it would be first time that reactor type was built outside China, so having it approved by the UK regulator would be significant,\u201d said Atherton. Kepco\u2019s motives for the Moorside interest are not yet clear. It may want to get a foothold in the UK and provide the finance to build AP1000 reactors designed by Toshiba subsidiary Westinghouse, with the Office for Nuclear Regulation expected to give clearance for the technology imminently after a four-year process. But it is thought to be more likely that Kepco would want to build its own South Korea-designed reactors at the site. Froggatt said: \u201cThe question is, does Kepco want to build AP1000s? The answer is no, it doesn\u2019t want to build them. If it went ahead, I assume they\u2019re buying the site and infrastructure. I assume they would put their own reactor through the licensing process.\u201d Kepco has a good recent track record of building reactors abroad. The first reactor in UAE is due to be connected to the grid this year, which Schneider said would be an \u201coutstanding achievement\u201d if achieved. In total, it operates 25 and is building three at home. The UK may be joining that list.",

With Brexit on the horizon, Pret said the new work experience programme was part of efforts to take on the \u201clong-term challenge that Pret and the wider industry must meet to ensure hospitality is seen by Brits as a serious career choice\u201d. \u201cAttracting British applicants is not exclusively a Pret problem, and is symptomatic of a wider cultural bias. British schools and parents don\u2019t always take careers in the hospitality industry seriously, but they really ought to. The industry has changed dramatically over the past 20 years and today it is strong, dynamic and growing,\u201d Andrea Wareham, human resources director at Pret, wrote in a blog on the company\u2019s website. Wareham told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that one in 50 applicants for jobs at Pret were British. She said the company would find it all but impossible to recruit enough staff if it were forced to turn its back on EU nationals after Brexit. Tanya de Grunwald of Graduate Fog, a campaigner for fair internships, said it was good for young people to experience the world of work, but the new placements should be paid. \u201cThe best kind of experience is hands-on experience where it is really clear that the young worker has set hours and responsibilities and is doing proper work. By law, if that\u2019s the case they should be paid.\u201d The minimum wage for the under-18s is \u00a34 an hour. It is \u00a35.55 for 18- to 20-year-olds and \u00a37.20 for the over-25s. De Grunwald said this low rate made it cheap to employ young people. \u201cIf Pret really wants to impress this age group they should be paying [the work experience participants],\u201d she said. Pret said it hoped to offer permanent roles to anyone who wished to apply following their experience week and would stay in touch with those who wanted to remain in education and apply at a later stage. The company will be promoting the Big Experience Week through a network of schools with which it already works on a school leavers programme. It will also run a social media campaign. Pret is also hoping to attract more British workers by increasing recruitment advertising, using social media, doubling the intake to its school leavers programme and working with Jobcentre Plus. This article was corrected on 25 March 2017. One in 50 of Pret job applicants are born in the UK, not one in 50 employees as stated in an earlier version.",
