      "bodyText": "A deal to sell 316 Royal Bank of Scotland branches to Santander dramatically collapsed on Friday night in the latest embarrassing blow for the 81%-state owned bank. The \u00a31.65bn sale of the branches to the UK arm of the Spanish bank was announced more than two years ago but has been repeatedly delayed by the logistical challenges of integrating two separate bank systems. The European Union had ordered RBS to offload the branches by the end of 2013 as a condition of the \u00a345bn of state aid the UK government pumped into the bank to stave off its collapse at the height of the financial crisis. Santander said the original deal had already been delayed by a year and it did not believe the transfer could be achieved by the companies' agreed final deadline of February 2013. Stephen Hester, RBS chief executive, said the bank would \"commence a new process of disposal\" and a spokesman for the bank said it would hold discussions with the EU and the UK government about moving back the sale deadline. The debacle will increase the pressure on Hester, who was parachuted in to run RBS after its October 2008 bailout and has come under the spotlight for the slow turnaround of the bank. Progress towards returning the bank to full private ownership has been much slower than the government had first hoped, with the bank reporting an increase in losses to \u00a31.5bn from \u00a3794m in the first half of the year. The bank has cut more than 5,000 jobs over the past year. RBS is also expected to be hit with a big fine for its role in the Libor rate-fixing scandal. Some experts believe it could be handed a bigger penalty than the \u00a3290m paid by Barclays. Hester said it was disappointing that Santander had pulled the plug on the deal so close to completion, but said: \"RBS's strong progress in our restructuring plans means we can continue to provide a stable home for this business and its customers pending a further resolution. \"While this is a profitable part of our business that we would rather not part with, RBS has worked hard to ensure it is substantially separate from our UK branch network and corporate business and largely ready to be taken on by a new owner.\" RBS moved to reassure the branches' 1.8 million customers there would be no disruption to service and said they need not take any action. Santander UK chief executive Ana Botin said: \"Our guiding principle throughout this transaction has been a seamless journey for customers, which requires the business to be delivered to Santander UK by RBS in a steady state. We have concluded that, given delays, it is not possible to complete this within a reasonable time frame.\" Steve Pateman, head of Santander UK's high street banking operation, said its executives \"reluctantly and sadly\" decided to pull out of deal late on Thursday night because consultants at Accenture predicted it would take until 2016 to complete the integration of the banks. \"We would have loved to own the RBS business but we won't any time soon, and the management decision was you have to go with plan B,\" he said. Pateman said that plan involved spending the cash it will save from the deal on \"deploying capital to grow our business organically\". Santander had already begun a branch closure programme in anticipation of the deal going ahead, with plans to close 56 branches to reduce overlap in its vast UK network following the takeovers of Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley. The 316 branches to be sold comprise 311 RBS branches in England and Wales and five NatWest in Scotland. The collapse of the long-planned deal will further delay the bank's return to private ownership and raises further speculation that RBS may have to be fully nationalised. In August, the cabinet reportedly held discussions about buying the 17% of RBS it does not already own for \u00a35bn. Chancellor George Osborne is said to oppose the idea but the business secretary, Vince Cable, has campaigned in favour of nationalisation in order to support small business lending. Cable wrote to David Cameron in March to urge him to use RBS as a vehicle for lending to small businesses. In August, the Treasury said: \"We are committed to repairing and returning RBS to full health so that it is able to support the UK economy in the future, and the current strategy is working to achieve that. The government's policy has always been to return RBS to the private sector, but only when it delivers value for money for the taxpayer.\" The taxpayer is already sitting on a paper loss of more than \u00a320bn from the government's intervention, with the shares close to half the value at which the government bought in. RBS has sacked four individuals involved in the Libor scandal, which forced the boss of Barclays, Bob Diamond, out of his job. The bank has also been forced to pay \u00a31.3bn in relation to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) and \u00a3125m to compensate customers who fell victim to a computer meltdown in June. The collapse of the branches sale comes just days after RBS successfully floated its Direct Line insurance arm, which was also demanded by Brussels as a condition of the \u00a345bn injection of taxpayer funds. News of the dramatic collapse of the sale came just hours after RBS tried to raise hopes that it was on the verge of being able to leave the government's asset insurance programme next week On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the bank was in negotiations with regulators and the Treasury over its exit from the Asset Protection Scheme. By the end of 2011, RBS had paid out a total premium of \u00a32.25bn in order to use the programme. The bank is now liable to pay \u00a3125m a quarter until it exits the APS.",

Now the economics have changed \u2013 as a result of higher energy prices, lower taxes and new drilling techniques \u2013 for fields such as Barryroe. \"We are leading the charge but we hope our success causes others to think about Ireland again,\" says O'Reilly. \"People are going to far-flung regions such as the Arctic, when they could be active in much more benign conditions.\"</p> <p>John Mullins, president of the Cork chamber of commerce and boss of the state-owned gas group Bord G\u00e1is, says foreign investment from IT and pharmaceutical groups has kept the region more buoyant than many others during the big economic downturn. Nevertheless, oil could help stem unemployment, which is nearly 10%. \"I'm not an expert in geology or seismology but all the information suggests quite a significant commercial find,\" says Mullins, who has already set up an oil and gas exploration group at the chamber. \"Whether it proves to be a false dawn or not, we need to be ready with partners to help.\"</p> <p>Also hoping for an oil boom is the Port of Cork. Executives there have already put forward plans for a \u20ac40m (\u00a332m) new multi-purpose terminal.

The dock managers have already received a delegation of Exxon executives.</p> <p>Foreign companies seem to be the key to much of what happens in Ireland at present. As one property manager said: \"When you talk to one of these large [overseas] firms it is like people from another planet. They are full of hope and optimism whereas locals have had so much bad news that cannot conceive anything getting better. No one in Ireland, perhaps O'Reilly aside, wants to take a risk: they're full of fear.\"</p>",

Now the economics have changed \u2013 as a result of higher energy prices, lower taxes and new drilling techniques \u2013 for fields such as Barryroe. \"We are leading the charge but we hope our success causes others to think about Ireland again,\" says O'Reilly. \"People are going to far-flung regions such as the Arctic, when they could be active in much more benign conditions.\" John Mullins, president of the Cork chamber of commerce and boss of the state-owned gas group Bord G\u00e1is, says foreign investment from IT and pharmaceutical groups has kept the region more buoyant than many others during the big economic downturn. Nevertheless, oil could help stem unemployment, which is nearly 10%. \"I'm not an expert in geology or seismology but all the information suggests quite a significant commercial find,\" says Mullins, who has already set up an oil and gas exploration group at the chamber. \"Whether it proves to be a false dawn or not, we need to be ready with partners to help.\" Also hoping for an oil boom is the Port of Cork. Executives there have already put forward plans for a \u20ac40m (\u00a332m) new multi-purpose terminal. This is mainly to handle containerised traffic but could be used for the oil support business, they explain. The dock managers have already received a delegation of Exxon executives. Foreign companies seem to be the key to much of what happens in Ireland at present. As one property manager said: \"When you talk to one of these large [overseas] firms it is like people from another planet. They are full of hope and optimism whereas locals have had so much bad news that cannot conceive anything getting better. No one in Ireland, perhaps O'Reilly aside, wants to take a risk: they're full of fear.\"",

A big row between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund over how to cut Greece some slack, endless Spanish prevarication, egged on by Germany, over whether to ask for a bailout, and deep differences over how to use the bailout funds mean that the promise evident since June is evaporating. But when EU leaders meet next week in Brussels for the first summit since what was touted as a breakthrough deal at the end of June, there will be no breakthrough, according to a government minister closely involved and other senior officials. Spain will not ask for a bailout, it is said. The new Greek dilemmas \u2013 over whether to extend the rescue programme by two years, how to plug the resulting funding gap, and what to do about Athens's dissolving debt sustainability targets \u2013 will simply be shelved, delegated to finance ministers next month. Instead of these immediate pressing issues, the summit is likely to be taken up with loftier if more remote German-led plans for greater fiscal rigour, discipline and surrender of national powers over fiscal and economic policy, as well as a fight between the 17 eurozone countries and the 10 non-euro members, Britain to the fore, over how powers are wielded at the proposed new eurozone banking supervisor, the European Central Bank. The new German disciplines, with some of the rough edges smoothed in the \"exploratory\" proposals from Herman Van Rompuy, chairing the summit, are mostly stick with a little bit of carrot. They envisage eurozone governments committing to structural reforms of their labour markets and welfare systems in enforceable \"contracts\". The carrot is that this would be accompanied by the creation \u2013 highly complex and it will take a while \u2013 of a separate eurozone budget (not to be confused with the EU budget) which would be small (maybe \u20ac20bn) and used to cushion the impact of the structural reforms. That's the German idea. The French are demanding that the eurozone budget be spent on relieving \"asymmetric shocks\" such as subsidising the costs of sudden surges in unemployment. Van Rompuy's proposals try to please both sides by saying the new budget or fund can be used for the German and the French purposes.

To prove he was serious, he hired bankers from Ondra Partners \u2013 whose sharp line-up of partners include the former Amersham boss Sir William Castell. By Wednesday the bid was over, killed by German government opposition. Had it limped on, the opposition of a man controlling more than 13% of the shares would have been hard to overcome.</p> <p>It is evidence of how Woodford, who summons FTSE 100 bosses to his Henley headquarters rather than travelling to the City, uses his power. To many, he is an example of what John Kay, commissioned by the government to encourage long-term investment, should look for in a fund manager, holding shares for 15 years rather than switching in and out in search of a quick buck.</p> <p>A farmer in his spare time with a degree from Exeter in agricultural economics, Woodford got his breakthrough during the technology bubble, which brought both the best and worst of times. In the 1990s he built up a solid reputation at Perpetual, a relatively small but fast-growing investment house he had joined in 1988. His funds out-performed but the headlines still belonged to others: Carol Galley at Mercury, Anthony Bolton at Fidelity and his own boss at Perpetual, Sir Martyn Arbib.</p> <p>As global stock markets were swept up in the technology, media and telecoms exuberance, Woodford stood back. He refused to buy \"new economy\" stocks and by early 2000 his one-year performance was the worst in the market. He fell off the major financial adviser buy lists, with one telling the Mail on Sunday that Woodford had \"missed the investment boat&#xa0;\u2026 He is becoming more intransigent. Maybe his pride is getting in the way.\"</p> <p>Then, from 2000 to 2003, the FTSE collapsed. Woodford's funds went up. His holdings in \"old economy\" businesses survived as internet stocks shrivelled. He invested into the least-loved sector of the stock exchange: tobacco. His holdings in British American Tobacco (Lucky Strike, Dunhill), Reynolds American (Camel, Winston) and Imperial Tobacco (Gauloise, Davidoff) turned into the star share price performers of the decade and remain at the core of his portfolio. No tobacco company deal in Britain can now be struck without Woodford's approval.</p> <p>When Perpetual was sold to Amvescap for \u00a31.1bn in 2001 (a deal in which Arbib pocketed \u00a3400m) it looked as if Woodford might walk. But the newly named Invesco Perpetual persuaded him to sign up for a five-year contract. Now with a 24-year tenure, his longevity with one fund manager is rare. He has worked at only one other fund management group (Eagle Star), helped by a culture which supports his style of investing, which is individualistic and led by conviction.</p> <p>Despite that, and despite having the look of a forthright panellist on a TV football programme, he is uncomfortable with punditry. Indeed, he told the Guardian that he did not regard himself as powerful. \"I'm a very active, long-term investor. My average holding is around 15 years. What that means is exactly what John Kay says: with ownership comes responsibility.\" This explains his decision to speak out during the BAE row. With a 13% holding he knew his view would be crucial.</p> <p>He sees his job as \"value discovery\". His funds are not intended to track stock market indices and he describes as \"socially useful\" his investment in unquoted companies \u2013 a cause of controversy as they can be riskier attract regulatory scrutiny.</p> <p>About 5% of his fund goes into companies spun out of places such as Oxford and Cambridge university.</p> <p>In reality, he is happier down on his farm in Hambleden near Henley, though when he tried to redevelop it last year he came up against a tough opponent in Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter.</p> <p>Paxman was among protesters who turned out to block plans by Woodford and his fiancee, Madeline White, with whom he has two children, to build an all-weather arena to train their horses. Paxman described it as \"enormous, unsightly and environmentally unfriendly\". In a rare defeat, Woodford withdrew the application.</p> <p>He also courted some controversy in 2008 by backing a series of flotations on the junior stock market, Aim, by City broker Cenkos and once again his performance is lagging. His \u00a320bn Income funds are a long way down the one-year performance league, perilously close to the bottom quartile in the tables. But this time, no one is talking about a fallen star. Woodford, who describes himself as patient investor, appears to have found patient followers too.</p> <p>\"I'm very conscious of my responsibility,\" he said. \"I am just doing my job. My job is to represent the people who have trusted with me their money.\"</p>",

It is evidence of how Woodford, who summons FTSE 100 bosses to his Henley headquarters rather than travelling to the City, uses his power. To many, he is an example of what John Kay, commissioned by the government to encourage long-term investment, should look for in a fund manager, holding shares for 15 years rather than switching in and out in search of a quick buck. A farmer in his spare time with a degree from Exeter in agricultural economics, Woodford got his breakthrough during the technology bubble, which brought both the best and worst of times. In the 1990s he built up a solid reputation at Perpetual, a relatively small but fast-growing investment house he had joined in 1988. His funds out-performed but the headlines still belonged to others: Carol Galley at Mercury, Anthony Bolton at Fidelity and his own boss at Perpetual, Sir Martyn Arbib. As global stock markets were swept up in the technology, media and telecoms exuberance, Woodford stood back. He refused to buy \"new economy\" stocks and by early 2000 his one-year performance was the worst in the market. He fell off the major financial adviser buy lists, with one telling the Mail on Sunday that Woodford had \"missed the investment boat \u2026 He is becoming more intransigent. Maybe his pride is getting in the way.\" Then, from 2000 to 2003, the FTSE collapsed. Woodford's funds went up. His holdings in \"old economy\" businesses survived as internet stocks shrivelled. He invested into the least-loved sector of the stock exchange: tobacco. His holdings in British American Tobacco (Lucky Strike, Dunhill), Reynolds American (Camel, Winston) and Imperial Tobacco (Gauloise, Davidoff) turned into the star share price performers of the decade and remain at the core of his portfolio. No tobacco company deal in Britain can now be struck without Woodford's approval. When Perpetual was sold to Amvescap for \u00a31.1bn in 2001 (a deal in which Arbib pocketed \u00a3400m) it looked as if Woodford might walk. But the newly named Invesco Perpetual persuaded him to sign up for a five-year contract. Now with a 24-year tenure, his longevity with one fund manager is rare. He has worked at only one other fund management group (Eagle Star), helped by a culture which supports his style of investing, which is individualistic and led by conviction. Despite that, and despite having the look of a forthright panellist on a TV football programme, he is uncomfortable with punditry. Indeed, he told the Guardian that he did not regard himself as powerful. \"I'm a very active, long-term investor. My average holding is around 15 years. What that means is exactly what John Kay says: with ownership comes responsibility.\" This explains his decision to speak out during the BAE row. With a 13% holding he knew his view would be crucial. He sees his job as \"value discovery\". His funds are not intended to track stock market indices and he describes as \"socially useful\" his investment in unquoted companies \u2013 a cause of controversy as they can be riskier attract regulatory scrutiny. About 5% of his fund goes into companies spun out of places such as Oxford and Cambridge university. In reality, he is happier down on his farm in Hambleden near Henley, though when he tried to redevelop it last year he came up against a tough opponent in Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter. Paxman was among protesters who turned out to block plans by Woodford and his fiancee, Madeline White, with whom he has two children, to build an all-weather arena to train their horses. Paxman described it as \"enormous, unsightly and environmentally unfriendly\". In a rare defeat, Woodford withdrew the application. He also courted some controversy in 2008 by backing a series of flotations on the junior stock market, Aim, by City broker Cenkos and once again his performance is lagging. His \u00a320bn Income funds are a long way down the one-year performance league, perilously close to the bottom quartile in the tables. But this time, no one is talking about a fallen star. Woodford, who describes himself as patient investor, appears to have found patient followers too. \"I'm very conscious of my responsibility,\" he said. \"I am just doing my job. My job is to represent the people who have trusted with me their money.\"",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone and the International Monetary Fund are locked in their worst showdown of Europe's three-year sovereign debt crisis, engaged in a dangerous game of brinkmanship over how to respond to a Greek bailout that is threatening to go off the rails. The IMF, it is understood in Brussels, is insisting that Greece's eurozone creditors and the European Central Bank write down or write off up to \u20ac30bn (\u00a324bn) in Greek debt to close a funding gap in the Greek rescue plan which may need to be extended by two years. The showdown between the eurozone and the IMF is being described as eyeball-to-eyeball, a shouting match, and a contest to see who will blink first. It is expected to come to a head next month. The IMF is demanding that the eurozone and the ECB resort to a new policy of Official Sector Involvement (OSI), meaning a writedown or writeoff of Greek debt to its official creditors - a move that the ECB and the German government are resisting fiercely. Greece needs a cash payout from its previously agreed bailout of more than \u20ac30bn next month, without which it will go bankrupt and be unable to pay public workers or pensioners. But a new report from the troika of European commission, European Central Bank and IMF officials suggests that Athens is highly unlikely to achieve the key IMF condition for Greece's second bailout of getting its national debt down to a \"sustainable\" 120% of gross domestic product by 2020. The word in Brussels, based on assessments from the troika officials scrutinising and enforcing Greece's compliance with the bailout terms, is that Athens could overshoot the debt target by as much as 25% , putting in doubt whether the IMF will remain part of the bailout.

Amid continuous speculation as to when Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, will submit a request for the biggest eurozone bailout yet, it is also understood that he will resist pressure to table the bid at next week's summit after warnings from Berlin against asking for help yet. Berlin is said to be telling Rajoy that Spain will fall on to a slippery slope and find itself cut out of the bond markets for years if it asks for a bailout The row comes as divisions open up in public between the IMF and eurozone leaders over the merits of austerity, after an IMF study released this week found that it had underestimated the impact that fiscal cutbacks have on economic growth. For Lagarde, though, the issue is clear. She reiterated on Friday that Greece should be given \"a bit more time\" to hit its targets.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has warned that world leaders fear a worsening of the global economic crisis as growth slows and pressure intensifies on indebted governments and weak banks. Speaking in Tokyo George Osborne on Friday, the chancellor said the immediate danger of another financial disaster had receded but the prospect of a seismic shock to the global economy in the next few years was heightened by \"a triple threat\", which could come from a further economic downturn in Europe, the US or emerging economies. Coming only days after the International Monetary Fund downgraded the growth forecasts for the majority of developed countries, including the UK, Osborne's view chimes with most policy-makers across the world. He said: \"There is less of an immediate sense of crisis at these meetings than there was at last year's annual meetings, but there is a greater concern about what lurks behind the next corner, a greater concern about the medium-term risks.\" The IMF has warned the US, Europe and Japan that a lack of action to refashion the financial system in the wake of the banking crisis has created problems for the future. In a report earlier this week it said the actions of the European Central Bank had lifted the immediate prospect of a eurozone country going bankrupt, but that risks remain next year unless there are moves to spur growth. Osborne said: \"You have the eurozone, the looming US fiscal cliff and an emerging market slowdown as triple threats to global recovery. \"What has been stressed at these meetings in Tokyo is the importance of delivery in all these areas: in the eurozone, delivering an effective implementation of what has been talked about; in the US, resolving the problem after the election of the fiscal cliff; and in emerging markets, continuing the structural reforms and openness that they require.\" Osborne is under pressure to relax Britain's austerity programme after more than two years of low or no growth. Economists expect to see the UK economy exit recession when GDP figures appear later this month, though the overall trend will remain flat. The IMF has given the UK the green light to delay some austerity measures in favour of a boost to investment and tax cuts. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the IMF's analysis that austerity measures could be more damaging for the economy than previously assumed gives Osborne the excuse he needs should he miss his deficit reduction targets later this month. \"This seems to give the go-ahead to the chancellor to defer some of his spending cuts until the economy is stronger,\" she said. The IMF calculated the impact of tax rises and spending cuts could lead to bigger reductions in GDP, effectively doing more harm than good to the economy and forcing the government to borrow more. Osborne is expected to miss his borrowing target for 2012-13 by as much as \u00a325bn after a fall in tax revenues and a rise in social security costs linked to high unemployment. He hinted in his speech to the Tory party conference earlier in the week that the global slowdown could encourage him to be more flexible in his approach. But at the IMF meeting he repeated his stance that countries needed to push ahead with spending cuts and structural reforms, saying: \"In general, western countries face a sink or swim question which the prime minister posed or, as he also put it, do or decline. \"In UK we are doing rather than declining.

It also suspended its shares and warned its financial poisition would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault.</p> <p>Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said it had been forced to recall the cabs and suspend all sales of its TX4 model after drivers reported serious problems with the power steering.</p> <p>The Coventry-based company - which manufactures the cabs in China - warned investors that the suspension of sales would have a \"very material and detrimental\" impact on its cash flow.</p> <p>The steering fault is just the latest problem to beset Manganese, which is 20% owned by Chinese car group Geely and has failed to turn a profit since 2007. This summer, just two days after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live#block-502826ca95cbf34442898d9f\" title=\"\">Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics</a> the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts.</p> <p>Manganese's UK sales dropped 9% last year to 1,502 taxis. The company's shares, which were suspended at 10p valuing the company at just \u00a33m has, have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than \u00a38 each.</p> <p>It is not the first time Manganese has been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. Four years ago it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire.</p> <p>John Russell, chief executive of Manganese Bronze, said there had been two incidences of drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\" due to the failure of the hydraulic system that powers the steering.</p> <p>Russell said that in both incidences a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circlip\" title=\"\">circlip</a>, which holds hydraulic fluid pipes in place, had either fallen off or been damaged. \"[This means] you get very erratic performance of the hydraulic fluid in the power steering, which results in odd characteristics [to the steering],\" he said.</p> <p>In both cases the drivers had been able to wrest back control of their vehicles and, Russell said, the fault had not led to any injuries.</p> <p>He said Manganese engineers had examined the vehicles \"and came to the conclusion that we did have a problem\".</p> <p>The company immediately began the recall and some of the affected vehicles are already off the streets. Russell said all owners and drivers of affected cabs were being contacted by phone and by letter.</p> <p>Russell said he was unable to say what had caused the problem or how long it would take to fix it. \"We know that drivers aren't earning a livelihood if they can't drive. That is a real issue, and we aim to get them back on the road and earning money as soon as possible,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are not going to have a witch hunt.

      "bodyText": "The company that makes London taxi cabs has launched an emergency recall of 400 black cabs after discovering a steering fault. It also suspended its shares and warned its financial poisition would be \"unclear\" until it had found a way to fix the fault. Manganese Bronze, which has been making black cabs since 1948, said it had been forced to recall the cabs and suspend all sales of its TX4 model after drivers reported serious problems with the power steering. The Coventry-based company - which manufactures the cabs in China - warned investors that the suspension of sales would have a \"very material and detrimental\" impact on its cash flow. The steering fault is just the latest problem to beset Manganese, which is 20% owned by Chinese car group Geely and has failed to turn a profit since 2007. This summer, just two days after the Spice Girls danced on top of five black cabs at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics the company revealed a \u00a33.9m black hole in its accounts. Manganese's UK sales dropped 9% last year to 1,502 taxis. The company's shares, which were suspended at 10p valuing the company at just \u00a33m has, have fallen 70% in the past year. Just five years ago, they were changing hands at more than \u00a38 each. It is not the first time Manganese has been forced to launch an emergency recall of the TX4 model. Four years ago it called back 5,000 of the early TX4 after some of them caught fire. John Russell, chief executive of Manganese Bronze, said there had been two incidences of drivers \"struggling to steer the vehicles correctly\" due to the failure of the hydraulic system that powers the steering. Russell said that in both incidences a circlip, which holds hydraulic fluid pipes in place, had either fallen off or been damaged. \"[This means] you get very erratic performance of the hydraulic fluid in the power steering, which results in odd characteristics [to the steering],\" he said. In both cases the drivers had been able to wrest back control of their vehicles and, Russell said, the fault had not led to any injuries. He said Manganese engineers had examined the vehicles \"and came to the conclusion that we did have a problem\". The company immediately began the recall and some of the affected vehicles are already off the streets. Russell said all owners and drivers of affected cabs were being contacted by phone and by letter. Russell said he was unable to say what had caused the problem or how long it would take to fix it. \"We know that drivers aren't earning a livelihood if they can't drive. That is a real issue, and we aim to get them back on the road and earning money as soon as possible,\" he said. \"We are not going to have a witch hunt. We want to find a solution the root cause. Then we will discover who is to blame, and questions will get answered.\" However, Russell pointed out that the company had recently contracted a new Chinese company to supply its steering box. \"We firmly believed that we had a better supplier, and we went through a very thorough test evaluation,\" he said. \"We are very disappointed.\" He said Manganese holds a contract with the supplier that \"covers warranty and negligence, and that contract will come into play\". The company is also suffering from growing competition. Mercedes-Benz began selling its Vito cab in 2008 and now supplies almost a third of the capital's 22,000-cab fleet. Nissan is also planning to break into the market next year with the launch of a modified version of minivans currently used by cabbies in New York. \"We are having a real tough time of it,\" Russell said. \"But we are one of the great British icons and so we will continue to power on. \"Despite various attempts to build a better taxi, no one has made a better one than ours.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bankers risk an \"uncontainable\" political backlash unless they agree to wide-ranging reforms to the financial sector, the favourite candidate to become the next Bank of England governor has said. Paul Tucker, currently its deputy governor, warned that without structural reforms that limit the cost of breaking up failing banks and prevent taxpayer bailouts, bankers would find themselves with few defences against an angry public. Tucker made his comments on Friday in response to demands from senior bankers at an international banking conference that regulators relax strict rules designed to prevent a repeat of the Lehman Brothers crash in 2008. A senior Japanese bank executive said taxpayers should remain on the hook for losses in the event of a crisis, while the one of the top brass at Deutsche bank argued that plans to ringfence the casino arms of major banks from their retail operations would make them less efficient and raise costs for customers. Speaking at the Institute of International Finance in Tokyo, Tucker said it was necessary to guarantee that taxpayers would escape paying again to bailout banks. \"The objective is to get to a point where public money is not used. If there was to be another financial crisis, once we have got through this one, and there was a need to bail out the banks, I think the backlash would be uncontainable,\" he said. Tucker was joined by Thomas Hoenig, a regulator on the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who said many major banks were too big to fail and needed to be broken up. The debate highlights the battle going on behind the scenes at meetings of regulators as they seek to agree rules for global bank regulation. The US has passed the Dodd-Frank Act, while the UK plans to bring in new laws based on a report by Sir John Vickers, who is also understood to have applied to succeed Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England governor. The EU is readying to push through new supervisory rules, though is only just considering a report that considers how to break up banks. Tucker said he believed it was possible for regulators to sit down with senior bankers and agree a method to re-finance them from private sources when they get into trouble, but they must accept public funds are off limits. Nobuyuki Hirano, president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said a taxpayer bailout should remain in the armoury of regulators. He said that without the possibility of taxpayer funds being used to re-finance banks, regulators were tying one arm behind their backs. Anshu Jain, co-chairman of Deutsche's management board, said attempts to ringfence the activities of banks would raise their costs and hit efficiency. Last night another frontrunner to become governor, Lord Turner, criticised the financial sector's conduct in the runup to the financial crisis in 2008. \"In retrospect, it was a fool's paradise \u2013 the band playing oblivious to the dangers ahead,\" he said. \"A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.\"",

    "webTitle": "FSA chief Lord Turner calls for new ideas to kickstart economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, has called for policymakers to be ready to design more innovative ways to kickstart the flatlining economy, in a speech in which he also distanced himself from the regulatory errors that led to the 2008 banking crisis. In what may be seen as his pitch to become governor of the Bank of England, Turner also told his City audience that he was wrong to back UK membership of the euro a decade ago and was ready to learn from his mistakes. Fiscal and banking union was now necessary if the euro was to survive, he said. Believed to be one of a handful of candidates to replace Sir Mervyn King as Bank governor next June, Turner attempted to counter any criticism of his handling of the banking crisis at the helm of the City regulator. Pointing out that he joined on 20 September 2008, the week after Lehman Brothers collapsed, unleashing a wave of panic across the financial world, Turner said: \"It felt like being appointed captain of the Titanic after we'd hit the iceberg but before we'd actually sunk.\" Echoing remarks by the Bank deputy governor Paul Tucker \u2013 also a candidate to take over from King \u2013 Turner warned that quantitative easing, the electronic printing of money used to pump \u00a3375bn into the economy so far, might lose its usefulness. Applications for the \u00a3302,000-a-year, eight-year role of governor of the Bank of England closed on Monday and an appointment is expected on 5 December. Turner gave a strong hint that he would back more unorthodox approaches to stimulate the economy at a time when politicians' ability to use fiscal policy is constrained, if funding for lending \u2013 the scheme designed to boost lending at a cheaper rate \u2013 proved not to be effective enough. \"We need to be ready if these measures prove insufficient to consider further policy innovations and further integration towards different aspects of policy, to overcome the powerful economic headwinds created by deleveraging across the developed world economies,\" Turner said. He agreed with the chancellor, George Osborne, who has warned about creating \"the stability of the graveyard\" when reforming banks. In his last annual address at Mansion House before the FSA is disbanded next year, Turner repeated his critique of the causes of the 2008 crisis, when a belief that low and stable inflation would create financial stability had proved \"to be profoundly wrong and dangerous, a major intellectual failure\" and said the process was already in train to stabilise the banking sector. \"In retrospect, it was a fool's paradise \u2013 the band playing oblivious to the dangers ahead,\" said Turner. \"A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.\" But after his assault on the City in 2009, when he declared that much of the sector's activities were \"socially useless\", Turner's language was more conciliatory. Blaming the \"roots of the crisis\" on banks and shadow banks, Turner said that other parts of the City \u2013 equity research, asset management, Lloyd's of London and commodities trading \u2013 had functioned well. \"It is essential that as we fix the problems of the banking system we also celebrate the success of many other City services and firms,\" he said. There were signs, he said, that \"many banking industry leaders recognise the need for major change\" to their culture. Turner, who also sits on the financial policy committee inside the Bank of England, charged with ensuring financial stability, admitted that there was a \"trade-off\" between making banks safer and fuelling growth through bank lending. Repeating that he was wrong to support the country's entry into the euro, he called for a solution involving banking union under the European Central Bank, with eurozone governments able to issue joint bonds. To succeed, the eurozone would need \"what has come to be labelled a banking union plus some fiscal integration\". \"Without such union and integration the eurozone cannot survive,\" Turner said. While the UK does not need to be part of the eurozone banking union, he said there was \"enormous national self interest in the eurozone either taking the steps required to succeed or if that is politically unattainable, dissolving in a controlled rather than a chaotic fashion\".",
