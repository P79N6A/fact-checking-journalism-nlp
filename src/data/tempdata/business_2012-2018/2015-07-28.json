      "bodyText": "The European commission has denounced as \u201cfalse and unfounded\u201d claims by Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis that international creditors had exclusive control over the country\u2019s tax system. Brussels slammed the suggestion that external supervision of the Greek tax revenue agency forced Varoufakis to consider hacking the ministry\u2019s computers as part of a secret plan to devise a parallel payment system for the nation. \u201cOn what Mr Varoufakis has been saying, the allegations that the troika was controlling the secretariat general of public revenues are false and unfounded,\u201d said Mina Andreeva, a spokeswoman for the European commission, referring to the triumvirate of lenders propping up the near bankrupt Greek economy. \u201cThe secretariat general of public revenue is a quasi-independent entity, responsible for tax administration, that is formally part of the Ministry of Finance.\u201d While creditors at the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund provided the tax system with technical assistance, it was \u201csimply not true\u201d that lenders controlled it, she added. The denunciation added a new twist to revelations that have shaken Greece after it emerged that Varoufakis, who resigned this month, had drawn up contingency plans outlining an alternative monetary system in the event of Athens being ejected from the eurozone. To create the parallel system \u2013 one that would allow the debt-stricken country to leave the euro \u201cat a drop of a hat\u201d \u2013 Varoufakis admitted that he had to hack his own ministry\u2019s computer system to access individual tax codes controlled \u201cfully and directly by the troika.\u201d The confession was made during a private conference call with investors that was subsequently revealed in the Greek media. \u201cIt was not under control of my ministry,\u201d Varoufakis was quoted as saying. \u201cIt was controlled by Brussels. The general secretariat is appointed, effectively, through a process that is troika-controlled and the whole mechanism within.\u201d The revelation of the covert scheme has added weight to speculation that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftwing government had planned to drop the euro even as it conducted fraught negotiations over further financial assistance with creditors. Government insiders have refused to be drawn on the former finance minister\u2019s claims. On Tuesday, the Greek media quoted prime ministerial aides as saying they had \u201ctired\u201d of Varoufakis. The prime minister, who turned 41 this week, is keen to conclude a third bailout with the EU and IMF that would unlock as much as \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) in fresh loans to keep the country afloat. Varoufakis is opposed to the stringent spending cuts and tax increases Athens has to agree to in exchange for the aid. With Greek banks operating under capital controls and the international standing of Athens damaged after months of acrimonious talks with creditors, largely overseen by Varoufakis, calls are also growing for the academic-turned-politician to be tried for high treason. On Tuesday night, supreme court prosecutor Efterpi Koutzamani forwarded two suits filed against Varoufakis by private individuals to parliament \u2013 a move that could see the 300-seat House lifting his political immunity, the first step towards him standing trial. The revelations overshadowed the start of an inspection tour in Athens by technical teams representing foreign lenders. Mission heads with the EU and IMF arrive in Athens on Wednesday and are expected to be greeted with draconian security as they try to gauge the parlous state of the Greek economy. Athens urgently needs emergency funds to avert defaulting on 20 August when it must meet a \u20ac3.4bn bond repayment to the ECB. Although capital controls are not expected to be lifted for several months, there were reports on Tuesday suggesting that the Athens stock exchange, which like banks had also been closed, would reopen later in the week. Lenders opened their doors 10 days ago after a three-week shutdown.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a safe prediction: a sale of RSA Insurance to Zurich, or any other foreign bidder, would produce not a single howl of anguish about a great British company being sold overseas. Insurance for cars and homes doesn\u2019t stir patriotic juices like chocolate (Cadbury\u2019s) or pharmaceuticals (AstraZeneca). The industry is utterly unloved on account of a business model that relies on sufficient numbers of punters being too dozy to notice the price rises slipped into renewal quotes. And, in RSA\u2019s case, everybody has always understood that chief executive Stephen Hester\u2019s task is to generate hard value for long-suffering shareholders by whatever means necessary. Zurich has called earlier than some expected, but Hester\u2019s strategy since February 2014 could almost have been designed to declutter RSA and attract a bidder. He launched a rights issue at the outset to buy himself some time, and negotiating room, during a disposal programme. But then he dispatched small units overseas at impressive speed: the Baltics, Poland, Thailand, China, Singapore, Italy and India have gone. Meanwhile, the Irish business has been detoxified after its reserves scandal. Outsiders can now see the attractive parts \u2013 the UK, Canada and the Scandinavian operations \u2013 more clearly. Perhaps the ideal time to sell would be after another round of self-help measures, meaning cost-cutting. But Zurich is at the door now and the capital demands for all insurers are under regulatory review. Hester will know that the bulk of his shareholders expect him to do his duty: talk to the Swiss and see if the likes of Axa and Allianz wish to play. One bidder is nice; More Than one would be better. Melrose places rivals in shade with Elster sale to Honeywell The Melrose crew make it look disarmingly simple: buy a strong but overweight engineering company, knock it into shape and then sell for a tidy profit. Elster, a meter business being sold to Honeywell for \u00a33.3bn, joins a long list of triumphs from a management team that started its routine at Wassall in the 1990s. There is a fair argument that this deal is one of the best in the collection. Melrose paid a 40% takeover premium to remove Elster from the US stock market for \u00a31.8bn in 2012. Three years later, its equity investment has risen 2.3 times in value and, by way of a cherry, Honeywell is taking not only Elster\u2019s pension fund but also a couple left over from past Melrose deals. What\u2019s the secret? That is the arresting part since Melrose claims to do nothing that other owners could not. For example: give managers direct accountability, close loss-making factories and stop divisions encroaching on each other\u2019s patches. Sceptics detect a whiff of asset-stripping but the record doesn\u2019t show it: investment at Melrose companies tends to exceed depreciation. At least \u00a32bn of the Honeywell cash will be returned to shareholders while management plots the next adventure. It\u2019s a roundabout way to proceed since, once a target is spotted, Melrose will want fresh funds. But the technique keeps the arithmetic clean and gives investors sight of what they\u2019re buying. On this occasion, it may also encourage Melrose to wait for prices in the sector to fall before it makes its next purchase. Elster is departing at 14 times last year\u2019s earnings, which is a fine price only from the seller\u2019s point of view. Biomass, the budget and Drax logic Three weeks after George Osborne\u2019s budget, Drax chief executive Dorothy Thompson remains shocked. The removal of renewable generators\u2019 exemption from the climate change levy was \u201can about-turn in a well-entrenched policy that has been a key underpinning for renewable investments since 2001\u201d. Fair comment. The 22% decline in Drax\u2019s share price since the budget, notwithstanding Tuesday\u2019s 10% bounce, illustrates the size of the surprise at Osborne\u2019s handiwork. Thus Thompson turned the interim results into an extended plea for the delights of biomass, the fuel gradually replacing coal in Drax\u2019s power station. Transporting wood pellets from North America doesn\u2019t tick every box in the green-energy checklist but Thompson is correct to say that power from biomass has the key benefit of reliability. If there\u2019s a lot of wind and solar capacity on the grid, we will need biomass, or something similar. Whether this argument will be heard by government is anybody\u2019s guess. Official policy is still to continue the madness of underwriting the world\u2019s most expensive nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It makes no sense. Biomass is neither perfectly green nor cheap, but its economics look vastly better than nuclear\u2019s.",

There is a fair argument that this deal is one of the best in the collection. Melrose paid a 40% takeover premium to remove Elster from the US stock market for \u00a31.8bn in 2012. Three years later, its equity investment has risen 2.3 times in value and, by way of a cherry, Honeywell is taking not only Elster\u2019s pension fund but also a couple left over from past Melrose deals.</p> <p>What\u2019s the secret? That is the arresting part since Melrose claims to do nothing that other owners could not. For example: give managers direct accountability, close loss-making factories and stop divisions encroaching on each other\u2019s patches. Sceptics detect a whiff of asset-stripping but the record doesn\u2019t show it: investment at Melrose companies tends to exceed depreciation.</p> <p>At least \u00a32bn of the Honeywell cash will be returned to shareholders while management plots the next adventure. It\u2019s a roundabout way to proceed since, once a target is spotted, Melrose will want fresh funds. But the technique keeps the arithmetic clean and gives investors sight of what they\u2019re buying.</p> <p>On this occasion, it may also encourage Melrose to wait for prices in the sector to fall before it makes its next purchase. Elster is departing at 14 times last year\u2019s earnings, which is a fine price only from the seller\u2019s point of view.</p> <h2>Biomass, the budget and Drax logic</h2> <p>Three weeks after George Osborne\u2019s budget, Drax chief executive Dorothy Thompson remains shocked. The removal of renewable generators\u2019 exemption from the climate change levy was \u201can about-turn in a well-entrenched policy that has been a key underpinning for renewable investments since 2001\u201d.</p> <p>Fair comment. The 22% decline in Drax\u2019s share price since the budget, notwithstanding Tuesday\u2019s 10% bounce, illustrates the size of the surprise at Osborne\u2019s handiwork. Thus Thompson turned the interim results into an extended plea for the delights of biomass, the fuel gradually replacing coal in Drax\u2019s power station.</p> <p>Transporting wood pellets from North America doesn\u2019t tick every box in the green-energy checklist but Thompson is correct to say that power from biomass has the key benefit of reliability. If there\u2019s a lot of wind and solar capacity on the grid, we will need biomass, or something similar.</p> <p>Whether this argument will be heard by government is anybody\u2019s guess. Official policy is still to continue the madness of underwriting the world\u2019s most expensive nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It makes no sense. Biomass is neither perfectly green nor cheap, but its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-plant-uk-government-edf-underwrite\">economics look vastly better than nuclear\u2019s</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Global markets have steadied despite a second successive day of declines in Chinese shares, as Beijing battled to rein in the stock market turmoil that has returned to haunt the world\u2019s second-largest economy. However, the sharp moves in China, coupled with bets on the first US interest rate hike since the financial crash, continued on Tuesday to send shockwaves through emerging markets \u2013 where currencies in particular came under pressure. But in Europe worries about China appeared to abate, allowing stock markets to halt a five-day losing streak. The FTSE 100 index in London closed up 0.8% at 6,555.28 points, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 1%. On Wall Street, stock markets also rebounded in early trading thanks to signs that China\u2019s share slide had eased off. On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite index initially fell more than 4% before rebounding and closing nearly 1.7% down at 3,663.82. It was another day of declines and followed Monday\u2019s rout, when the index had its biggest one-day collapse since 2007, with a fall of 8.5%. The smaller Shenzhen index closed down 2.24% at 2,111.70, after a similarly volatile day, having plummeted by more than 7% on Monday. Bernard Aw, a market analyst at spreadbetting firm IG, said: \u201cThings don\u2019t look that bad today but we need to see a few more sessions to gauge whether the sharp decline of [Monday] has reached a bottom. [Wednesday] might show a clearer picture.\u201d China\u2019s latest stock market upset has added to wider concerns about the state of the Chinese economy and helped send the prices of commodities such as oil and copper tumbling. Prices for copper, of which China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer, fell to a six-year low on Monday. However, it staged a slight revival on Tuesday, with benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange rising 2.2% to close at $5,300 a tonne . Gold also edged up but was not far off five-and-a-half-year lows hit last week in heavy selling as investors moved out of the precious metal. While viewed as a safe asset in uncertain times, gold does not pay interest or a dividend and so is losing its shine as expectations of a interest rate hike in the US intensify. Analysts pointed to the volatility in China, the world\u2019s top energy consumer, for oil\u2019s tumble to six-month lows early on Tuesday. Brent crude prices managed to rebound later on but were still below $54 a barrel, having halved in price over the last year. Among emerging-market currencies, Malaysia\u2019s ringgit and Thailand\u2019s baht both hovered around multi-year lows against the dollar as the hot money that poured into developing economies during the years of ultra-loose US monetary policy began to flow back out. Market experts see no let-up in the selling pressure on emerging-market assets, with currencies particularly vulnerable. \u201cEmerging currencies have been in a bear market since 2013 and prospects for a sustained recovery look poor. With emerging-market growth slipping to its weakest level since 2009, foreign capital inflows have been dwindling. Meanwhile, China\u2019s slowdown is contributing to slow world trade growth and continued downward pressure on commodity prices, hitting emerging markets\u2019 terms of trade,\u201d said Adam Slater at the consultancy Oxford Economics. Before the markets opening on Tuesday, Beijing vowed to press on with efforts to tame China\u2019s volatile stock market and prevent further panic. A state-controlled stock-buying agency would \u201ccontinue to buy stocks to stabilise the market\u201d, said Zhang Xiaojun, at China\u2019s securities regulator, the CSRC. An editorial in the Shanghai Securities Daily, a state-run newspaper, said: \u201cIn the future, the market will not fall off a cliff. The government will not allow such a situation to happen again.\u201d Beijing\u2019s interventions appeared to have prevented a repeat sell-off on Tuesday. Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York, said: \u201cThey have chosen this narrative of: \u2018We are going to beat the market. We are going to essentially triumph over market forces.\u2019\u201d But, he said, that strategy carried serious risks for China\u2019s Communist party leaders. \u201cRule number one is: you don\u2019t want to promise the unachievable. The answer is: let the market find its level \u2013 I don\u2019t see why they didn\u2019t do that in the first place. In 2007, the market collapsed by 70% and it didn\u2019t derail the Chinese economy.\u201d Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets, said Monday\u2019s rout appeared to have been caused by Beijing withdrawing the support it had been pumping into the stock market after June\u2019s collapse in which $3tn (\u00a31.9tn) was wiped off the value of listed companies. That move was likely to have been executed \u201ceither to test the waters to see whether the market could withstand their absence or potentially even to try and scale back on things\u201d, Spooner said. \u201cIt appears that that didn\u2019t work.\u201d Beijing has taken unprecedented steps to stave off the threat of a more severe stock market collapse in recent weeks including freezing flotations and using a state-run \u201cstabilisation fund\u201d to pump billions of dollars into the market. But analysts warn that while such interventions might work in the short term, in the longer term they would fail. \u201cTo some extent these \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 initiatives can actually make these things a bit worse since they make things opaque, they mean that people become nervous,\u201d said Spooner. \u201cThe very fact that the authorities are acting to do things to shore the market up creates a nervousness and it is difficult for people to know where the real value is.\u201d Chovanec said: \u201cThe chronic issue in China is that they want a correction without having a correction. They know that the market is out of whack. They know that a correction is necessary. They know that it is unhealthy not to have a correction. But they can\u2019t stomach the idea of actually having a real correction.\u201d Additional research by Luna Lin",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PS: Don\u2019t miss this piece on child poverty in the UK ; worth considering alongside today\u2019s \u2018encouraging\u2019 GDP data: That may be all for today, I think. I\u2019ll be back if there\u2019s any major news out of Greece. Otherwise, enjoy the afternoon..... GW Greece has been given the green light to re-open its stock market, according to Bloomberg. It\u2019s almost a month since the Athens exchange was closed, when capital controls were implemented. Those bailout talks in Greece have not got off to a great start: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has issued a warning that monetary policy is diverging, in both major economies and developing ones. The US is likely to raise interest rates in September, S&amp;P reckons, followed by the Bank of England. In contrast, the European Central Bank is continuing to ease policy with its \u20ac60bn/month stimulus programme. S&amp;P senior economists Tatiana Lysenko predicts: \u201cOver the next 18 months, we expect tightening of monetary policy in Turkey and South Africa--the countries with large external deficits that are vulnerable to a reversal in global capital flows. In Latin America, we expect both Brazil and Mexico to tighten monetary policy, albeit for different reasons.\u201d But banks in the Asia-Pacific are likely to ease policy. Ditto Russia, although this might not be possible if there is fresh turbulence in the currency market. The tale of former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s secret Plan B for a parallel payment system has taken another twist. The European Commission has robustly denied Varoufakis\u2019s claim that Greece\u2019s creditors had control of the computer systems of the tax offices, forcing him to consider hacking into it. Details of Varoufakis\u2019s plan leaked over the weekend, after he disclosed them on a conference call with hedge fund managers. Unbowed, he\u2019s now published a comment piece in the FT defending his plan, claiming the new system would have provided urgently-needed liquidity, by allowing firms to offset tax payments against outstanding bills: Time to look at Greece. And in Athens the inspector tour by international auditors continues apace \u2013 under draconian security. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. At no time in the five years that international monitors have visited Greece has security been as visible or tight. After the very public row of where to host officials representing the EU, ECB, ESM and IMF and what to let them see, Greek authorities have now gone the other way throwing a security ring around them like no other. As auditors kicked off their inspection tour with a visit to the State General Accounting Office \u2013 the government agency that oversees financial management of the Greek state \u2013 police trailed them on the streets while a helicopter monitored their every move overhead. Some 250 police are believed to have been seconded to guard the Athens Hilton where the teams are now staying. The draconian measures will be stepped up when mission heads join the technical teams later this week. In the past mission chiefs have been the focus of protests with demonstrators not only heckling the auditors but on one occasion throwing coins at them. The imposition of new biting austerity \u2013 by a leftist government no less \u2013 has raised fears of impromptu protests again. All of which might explain why Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is still trying to play down the visit. \u201cWhatever there is to learn from the meetings you will learn from the coordinators of the negotiation on the part of the government,\u201d the deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas told reporters outside the General Accounting Office shortly after technical teams had slipped in. \u201cWe are informing [them] and giving the information that is needed so that the negotiations move normally.\u201d The decision on whether to raise UK interest rates will soon fall, in part, on the shoulders of economist Gertjan Vlieghe. He\u2019s just been named as the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Vlieghe, who starts in September, is currently a partner at hedge fund giant Brevan Howard. He\u2019s previously worked at Deutsche Bank. Vlieghe will be an \u2018external\u2019 member of the MPC, replacing David Miles. But he won\u2019t need any help finding his way around the BoE - as he was once an advisor to former governor Mervyn King. Time for a recap on the GDP figures, by Jill Treanor: Britain\u2019s economic growth bounced back in the second quarter of the year, according to official data on Tuesday, fuelling the debate about the first rise in interest rates since the financial crisis. There were also signs that living standards are returning to their pre-crisis levels as the Office for National Statistics said that GDP per head was now \u201cbroadly equal\u201d to the first quarter of 2008, before the economic crisis drove the UK into recession. After a slowdown in the first three months of the year to 0.4%, the first estimate for second quarter growth stood at 0.7%, in line with City expectations, but just off the pace of growth recorded at the end of 2014. The growth was fuelled by the service sector, which will stoke fears that the recovery is not spreading to all sectors of the economy. Manufacturing, one of the sectors targeted by the government, fell by 0.3%. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cAdmittedly, growth remains very unbalanced. The services sector drove the rise in GDP, while construction output was flat and manufacturing output fell. But at least it looks as though productivity growth is continuing to pick up\u201d.... Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s full story: My colleague Katie Allen writes that while Britain\u2019s economy is growing at a decent rate, the underlying picture is less cheery - with many people still finding the labour market tough: The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned about this as he makes the case for holding off a potentially damaging early interest rate rise. \u201cThere are still people without a job who would like a job; there are still people with jobs who would like to work more hours. And, even for those that have got jobs, their pay \u2013 in most cases \u2013 isn\u2019t racing away,\u201d he told BBC Newsnight last week. The latest analysis of what jobs are available gives yet more reasons for caution. Advertised salaries have fallen to an 11-month low, as growth in the workforce is driven by lower-paid roles and part-time positions, according to jobs search engine Adzuna.co.uk which aims to list every vacancy advertised. These latest GDP figures underline the very British addiction to low-paid labour rather than more innovative and productive economic activity. For all the government\u2019s pledges to rebalance the economy, the dominant services sector is the only part of Britain\u2019s economy to be back to its pre-crisis peak. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full analysis: Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, fears Britain\u2019s economy isn\u2019t balanced enough to handle fresh problems in Europe and China, or a slowing world economy. \u201cThe OBR has revised down productivity next year and for three years after that. Manufacturing is down by 0.3% and the Government is on course to miss its exports target by hundreds of billions of pounds. \u201cThe Chancellor is complacent at a time when he should take action to support exporters and strengthen Britain\u2019s infrastructure. Pulling the plug on major rail electrification and hitting households next April with a work penalty in the tax credit system are the wrong choices for the long term.\u201d The 0.3% decline in manufacturing output in the last quarter has alarmed Britain\u2019s trades unions. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe government\u2019s economic plan is not delivering what was promised. We were told there would be a march of the makers, but instead manufacturing continues to decline. And while there is a desperate need for affordable homes, construction output remains in the doldrums. \u201cWe need a new plan for productivity and growth, because the current one is not delivering across the whole economy \u2013 a plan with stronger investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills. But the cuts the Chancellor is planning will damage demand and run the risk of reducing future growth.\u201d Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, is also struck by how private sector service firms are leading the recovery, thanks to consumer spending. Activity in retailing, hotels, restaurants and related services is 4.5% up on a year ago and the output of transport services has risen by 3.7%. Business and financial service growth in the past year is also over 3%. Manufacturing output and public services are much more sluggish, with output growing by just 0.5% or so over the past year Britain\u2019s factories probably suffered from the weak European economy and stronger pound, says Jeremy Cook of World First: \u201cPeople are spending money because they feel more secure in their jobs and those jobs are starting to pay more than inflation is taking away. \u201cThe environment for manufacturers is less pleasant. Despite the government\u2019s pledges to drive a \u2018march of the makers\u2019 and reinvigorate the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector, growth remains hard to come by. \u201cA 0.3% contraction can be chalked up to many things, but weakness in Europe and the overt strength of the pound will not be helping matters. I now understand George Osborne\u2019s motoring references: The pound jumped when the GDP data was released, as traders anticipated that stronger growth made an interest rate rise more likely. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar today. James Knightley of ING sums up the growth data: The dominant service sector also grew 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, while there was also a strong contribution from the oil and gas industry. However, manufacturing output fell 0.3% as a combination of the strong pound and weak export markets hurt activity. Construction output was flat on the quarter. And with spare capacity being mopped up, the Bank of England could raise borrowing costs by early 2016: We suspect that two members of the MPC may well vote for a rate hike in August although there may not be critical mass until February next year. If Britain maintains its current growth rate, it could retain the title of fastest-growing G7 country. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: Growth of 2.6% in 2015 would likely make the UK, the fastest growing G7 economy as it was in 2014. IHS currently forecasts GDP growth in 2015 of 2.2% in the US, 1.7% in Germany, 1.2% in France and 1.0% in Japan. We see overall Eurozone growth at 1.5% in 2015 After a slow start, Britain is the third-fastest growing member of the G7 since the financial crisis, behind Canada and the US: These other countries will all report their GDP in the next few weeks - we get the US on Thursday, Canada on Friday, eurozone data on August 14, and Japan on the 17th. Oil and gas extraction also made a positive contribution to growth, with output jumping by 7.8%. The ONS say that may be due to tax cuts for the oil industry announced in March\u2019s budget. This is disappointing. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank by 0.3% during the last quarter, dealing another blow to hopes of a \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d. In contrast, the business services and finance sub-sector grew by 0.8%. I know we bang on about services being the \u2018dominant\u2019 part of the economy. But it\u2019s true. For all the talk of manufacturing revival, only the service sector is larger than its pre-crisis peak: The UK economy has now grown for 10 straight quarters, and bounced back from its weakness at the start of the year: Chancellor George Osborne has welcomed today\u2019s figures with a flurry of automotive metaphors: Now this is significant. Britain\u2019s economic output, per person, has finally reached its level achieved before the crisis. The ONS says that: The 0.7% increase in GDP growth in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2015 implies that GDP per head would be broadly equal to the pre-economic downturn peak in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2008. The total UK economy is now 5.2% higher than its pre-crisis peak in early 2008. Once again, Britain\u2019s service sector provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter You can see the full report from the Office for National Statistics here: Gross Domestic Product Preliminary Estimate, Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2015 Britain\u2019s agriculture sector shrank by 0.7% during the quarter. Here\u2019s some detail: Britain\u2019s service sector grew by 0.7% during the last quarter, maintaining its dominant contribution to the economy. Industrial output jumped by 1%. Construction was flat, though, with no growth compared to Q1. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.6% - down from 2.9% three months ago. Here we go! Growth across the UK accelerated in the last quarter. GDP rose by 0.7% in the three months to June, up from 0.4% in the first three months of the year. That\u2019s the 10th straight quarter of growth, and bang in line with expectations. More to follow.... The pound is dipping a little as traders get edgy with 9.30am BST approaching..... Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, also believes today\u2019s growth data could put the Bank of England in the spotlight: An upbeat result would reinforce recent comments from BOE officials expressing concerns about wage inflation and fuel speculation about oncoming tightening. Needless to say, such a scenario is likely to bode well for the British Pound. Which would be good news for Brits heading abroad for a summer holiday.... Just 30 minutes to go...... Back in the City, oil giant BP has fallen back into the red as the costs of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster continue to mount. My (new) colleague Graham Ruddick has the story: There are a range of forecasts for today\u2019s GDP reading - from a punchy 0.8% growth down to a mediocre 0.4%. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicts that the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the last quarter - slightly lower than the City consensus of 0.7%. Their global strategist, Kit Juckes, agrees that the Bank of England could soon hike borrowing costs. The UK economy is trundling along, and with daily reports of shortages in the labour market, it is trundling closer to the rate lift-off. Over in Greece, officials from its creditors have just been spotted arriving for today\u2019s talks, according to AFP: The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has risen by 30 points in early trading, as investors await today\u2019s GDP figures at 9.30am BST. Insurance group RSA are leading the risers, soaring 10% after rival Zurich confirmed it might launch a bid. Royal Mail, though, are the top faller - down 2.5% after regulator Ofcom suggested it was discriminating against rival delivery firms by charging unfairly high prices. Let\u2019s be frank, GDP is a somewhat blunt instrument when it comes to measuring how an economy is performing, for several reasons.... Today\u2019s \u2018first estimate\u2019 of GDP only includes around 40% of the total data GDP doesn\u2019t measure inequality -- whether the increase in economic output is being shared fairly It also doesn\u2019t distinguish between different types of economic activity -- short-term versus long term, or harmful activities vs beneficial ones. GDP per capita is a better way of assessing how the economy performed relative to population changes. Economist Diane Coyle has written about this issue for us: But until policymakers find a better way, we\u2019re stuck with it. Today\u2019s data may show that UK factories and builders struggled in the April-June quarter, while the service sector performed better. From the Press Association\u2019s preview: Investec economist Chris Hare said the dominant services sector - representing three-quarters of output - was likely to do \u201cmost of the legwork\u201d with the beleaguered construction and manufacturing industries set to have shrunk. Scotiabank\u2019s Alan Clarke said 0.7% was \u201cprobably the right call\u201d but that monthly data published so far meant that any risks to this were skewed towards a slightly weaker rather than stronger outcome. Today\u2019s growth figures will also help decide when the Bank of England might start to hike borrowing costs. My colleague Katie Allen explains: Economists predict official figures on Tuesday will show GDP growth bounced back in the second quarter after a new-year slowdown. Alongside fading worries about the Greek debt crisis and signs of rising living standards, any such recovery in headline growth could fan expectations that the Bank\u2019s policymakers are readying to raise interest rates, perhaps even before the end of the year. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s GDP preview: Britain is the first G7 country to release growth figures for the second quarter of 2015, so this morning\u2019s data will give an early hint of how the global economy is faring (we get growth figures for the US on Thursday) Good morning. We\u2019re about to learn whether the UK economy strengthened in the last three months. New GDP figures, due at 9.30am BST, will show how much Britain\u2019s economy grew by between April and June. Economists predict growth of around 0.7%, which would be an improvement on the 0.4% growth seen at the start of the year. As Capital Economics senior UK economist Samuel Tombs put it: \u201cEncouragingly, the gamut of the survey data suggests that GDP growth is likely to have improved significantly from the 0.4 per cent rate recorded in the first quarter.\u201d And unless the forecasts are wildly inaccurate, that would mean Britain\u2019s economy has grown for 10 quarters in a row. We\u2019ll also be looking to see which parts of the economy did well, and which struggled. Did Britain\u2019s service sector provide the bulk of the growth? We\u2019ll also be tracking other events across the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. On the agenda: China\u2019s stock market which has been volatile today after yesterday\u2019s plunge, and Greece (where technical talks over a third bailout are now underway). Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had pledged that talks will resume \u201cwith much more intensity\u201d, in an attempt to reach a deal quickly. There\u2019s also a swathe of company news today, including results from oil giant BP and retailer Next.",

      "bodyText": "Chancellor George Osborne has announced that Gertjan Vlieghe, a senior economist at hedge fund Brevan Howard, will replace David Miles on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. The move marks a return to the Bank for the dual British-Belgian national Vlieghe, who was economic assistant to the previous governor Lord Mervyn King. He left that post to work as a bond strategist at Deutsche Bank in London before moving to Brevan Howard, where he is a partner. His appointment to the Bank\u2019s nine-member MPC, starting in September, comes as the debate around interest rates heats up. After more than six years of rockbottom rates at 0.5% ushered in by the financial crisis, some policymakers say the time to raise borrowing costs is nearing. Governor Mark Carney has told borrowers to start preparing for a rise and hinted it could happen around the turn of the year. Miles has not once voted for a move in either direction in interest rates in more than 70 policy meetings at the Bank, although he has one more vote to go next week. He used his final speech as an MPC member to indicate a rate rise was getting closer and he also rejected the \u201cdove\u201d label ascribed to him given his apparent support for monetary stimulus during his six years there. Vlieghe, who has a PhD from the London School of Economics, takes over from Miles as an \u201cexternal member\u201d of the committee, one of four rate-setters appointed by the chancellor to bring in expertise from outside the Bank. He is appointed for an initial three-year term. Carney, whose own tenure at the Bank began in July 2013 and will end in June 2018, welcomed Vlieghe to the committee. \u201cJan\u2019s insight, judgment and perspective will be invaluable to the committee in the coming years, and I very much look forward to working with him,\u201d Carney said. Osborne highlighted Vlieghe\u2019s mix of public and private sector experience. He said in a statement: \u201cDr Vlieghe is an economist of outstanding ability who brings experience from his time at both the Bank of England and the financial services industry to the role and will be a strong addition to the MPC.\u201d The chancellor has previously faced criticism for failing to appoint women to the policy committee and the Treasury said upon announcing Vlieghe\u2019s appointment that it received 26 applications for the position, of which six were from women. The appointment last year of Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik as one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors ended four years of an all-male MPC. With this latest appointment the full list of MPC members from 1 September will be: Mark Carney (governor); Ben Broadbent (deputy governor, monetary policy); Minouche Shafik (deputy governor, markets and banking); Sir Jon Cunliffe (deputy governor, financial stability); Andy Haldane (executive director, monetary analysis and chief economist); and external members Kristin Forbes, Martin Weale, Ian McCafferty and Gertjan Vlieghe.",

      "bodyText": "Sugary drinks designed for children\u2019s school lunchboxes are to be withdrawn from sale at Tesco amid concern over childhood obesity. From September, Tesco will stop selling pouches and cartons of high-sugar Ribena, Capri-Sun and Rubicon drinks that have been popular with parents, often marketed as \u201cfun\u201d, \u201cperfect for on the go\u201d and \u201cyour daily dose of Vitamin C\u201d. One 330ml pouch of Capri-Sun orange juice drink (priced at 89p) contains 33g of sugar, nearly double the daily amount recommended by the NHS for four- to six-year-olds (19g a day) and far above the 24g limit for seven- to 10-year-olds. Tesco will continue to sell the \u201cno added sugar\u201d versions of the drinks as well as the larger bottles of the high-sugar drinks aimed at adults. Supermarkets have come under intense pressure from campaign groups such as Action on Sugar, amid reports that one in four children in Britain are overweight or obese, the second highest level in the world. Kawther Hashem, nutritionist and researcher for the Action on Sugar group, said: \u201cOur advice is to eat the fruit, don\u2019t drink the juice. Juice should be an occasional treat, not an \u2018everyday\u2019 drink. These processed drinks are laden with sugar and calories and do not have the nutritional benefits of fresh fruit and vegetables. \u201cThis is great news from Tesco; it shows they are taking the issue of sugar in soft drinks seriously. \u201cWe would very much like to see other sugary food and drink categories in Tesco do something similar and, more importantly, for all the other retailers to also take on this challenge right away.\u201d But Tesco\u2019s move has provoked a backlash from some customers determined to keep buying sugary drinks \u2013 with the hashtag #saveourribena soon appearing on Twitter, and some accusing the supermarket of corporate hypocrisy. The major supermarkets say they have already taken action on their own-brand high-sugar drinks. Tesco said it is reducing the sugar content of its own-brand soft drinks by 5% a year, claiming to have cut 4.5bn calories from its range of drinks. Sainsbury\u2019s says it has removed 2,388 tonnes of sugar per year from its own-brand drinks. But Tesco\u2019s decision to remove some Capri-Sun and Ribena products is the first time action has been taken against branded suppliers of high-sugar drinks. Capri-Sun is distributed in the UK by Coca Cola Enterprises, while Ribena was sold by GlaxoSmithKline to Suntory of Japan in 2013. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to help our customers make healthier choices and that\u2019s why we have pledged to continue to cut sugar from the food and drink on our shelves. From September all the children\u2019s juice drinks we sell will have no added sugar in them because we know it\u2019ll make a positive difference to children\u2019s health.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s insurance industry looks set for another major shake-up, with Zurich Insurance considering a bid for troubled UK rival RSA, which owns the More Than brand and is run by former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester. Shares in RSA leapt 18% to 518.5p on Tuesday after the Swiss insurer, which is listed in London, said it was \u201cevaluating a possible offer\u201d. Analysts predict that a bid will come in at around 550p a share, valuing RSA at \u00a35.5bn. RSA said in response that it had \u201cnot held talks with or received a proposal from Zurich and shareholders are advised to take no action\u201d. It would be Zurich\u2019s biggest takeover in 15 years, and give it a leading position in the UK where it has been selling home, car and life insurance for decades. The news could herald a bidding war and comes weeks after Swiss insurer ACE agreed an \u00a318bn deal to buy US property insurer Chubb \u2013 the biggest takeover in the insurance sector to date. In April, Aviva bought Friends Life for \u00a35.6bn to create the UK\u2019s biggest insurance and savings group. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said: \u201cWe think that there could be a number of other interested parties including the likes of Axa and a number of US-based insurers that might enter the fray.\u201d A takeover could mean a big payday for Hester, who is leading a turnaround effort at RSA but suffered a shareholder revolt over his multimillion pound pay package at the annual meeting in May. According to RSA\u2019s annual report, Hester holds 21,500 RSA shares and last year was awarded 585,431 performance shares which vest in 2017. At an offer price of 550p, these shares would be worth \u00a33.3m. RSA hired Hester early last year to overhaul the business after a string of profit warnings and an accounting scandal in Ireland. Hester has sold off assets, brought in a new management team, and launched a \u00a3748m rights issue. The company employs 19,000 people worldwide, including 8,000 in the UK. It also operates in Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. The Swiss insurer said RSA \u201cwould be a good fit\u201d, expanding Zurich\u2019s presence in the UK and Ireland, and giving it access to the retail markets of Scandinavia and Canada. Zurich is Europe\u2019s third-largest insurer and employs 55,000 people worldwide, including 7,000 in the UK. It revealed last year it had at least $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in spare cash to spend on deals. Ben Cohen, analyst at stockbroker Canaccord, said: \u201cWhile we expect Zurich shareholders to be cautious in their response, reflecting management\u2019s lack of track record in a deal of this scale, and the material long tail and pension liabilities that would be brought onto Zurich\u2019s balance sheet, there would likely be material synergies, and a purchase would give Zurich a leading position in the UK, add materially to Latin American scale, and give entry to two attractive markets, Canada and Scandinavia.\u201d Under stock market rules, Zurich must now confirm by 5pm on 25 August whether it will make a formal offer for RSA. Zurich could apply for an extension to this deadline, but if it decides to walk away then it will be blocked from making an offer for the British insurer for at least six months. RSA shares have risen sharply over the last month amid speculation about a takeover bid. Rumours of a break-up of RSA have been fuelled by Cevian Capital, the activist hedge fund, building a 13% stake in the business which has made it the insurer\u2019s largest shareholder. RSA, which was known as Royal &amp; Sun Alliance before shortening its name in 2008, dates back more than 300 years. The current business was created from the \u00a36bn merger of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance in 1996.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has overtaken Asda to become the UK\u2019s second-biggest supermarket as sales at the Walmart-owned chain continue to fall much faster than any of its major rivals. Asda\u2019s sales dropped 2.7% in the 12 weeks to 19 July, according to the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel, taking its market share to 16.4%, 0.6 percentage points lower than a year before. It was the worst performer, not only among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, but also behind smaller rivals Iceland and the Co-op. Sainsbury\u2019s sales also fell \u2013 but by just 0.3% so that its market share dipped by only 0.1 percentage points to 16.5%, putting it just above its rival. Sainsbury\u2019s has previously pulled ahead of Asda for brief periods over the past few years, but generally that has been at Christmas, when the London-based chain benefits from shoppers seeking out the quality fresh food it is known for. This is the first time since 2003 that Sainsbury\u2019s has pulled ahead outside of Christmas, according to Kantar. \u201cAsda has had a slow 2015,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt from Kantar Worldpanel. \u201cAsda is being run more for profit rather than market share or revenue. It also hasn\u2019t got a substantial convenience store estate while convenience is acting as a real growth driver for Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d He added that Asda was also being held back by its lower concentration of stores in the south of England and London, where growth is proving stronger than in the retailer\u2019s northern heartland. Both Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s remain a long way behind Tesco, with 28.5% market share, a fall of 0.4 percentage points. Asda said it was no surprise that figures on the industry were \u201cvolatile from month to month\u201d as it was \u201cgoing through one of the toughest trading periods to face UK supermarkets.\u201d \u201cAs a strong and balanced business we remain focused on our long term strategy for building a sustainable business over the coming years. We won\u2019t make knee jerk decisions because of the short-term picture,\u201d a spokesman said. The Kantar figures also revealed that Co-op enjoyed its first rise in sales in just over a year, indicating that a turnaround effort may be starting to gain traction. Sales rose by a healthy 1%, the chain\u2019s fastest pace of growth in two years, helping it to maintain its 6.3% market share. The chain has been opening more convenience stores, cutting prices and recently announced plans to put 1,000 more staff on its shop floors in an attempt to win over shoppers. \u201cThe Co-op has been spending a lot of money on its estate and that seems to be having a benefit. It is getting younger, more upmarket shoppers,\u201d said McKevitt. \u201cThis could be the start of life getting better for the Co-op.\u201d That turnaround came despite a 1.6% fall in the price of comparable groceries across the market, according to Kantar, amid an ongoing supermarket price war and falling food prices. Kantar said supermarket prices had been consistently falling since September 2014 and were not likely to rise again until early next year. One of the biggest influences on price has been the rise of grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl who continue to grow at a pace which far outstrips their bigger rivals. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 16.6% in the 12 weeks to 19 July according to Kantar data while Lidl\u2019s rose by 11.3%, taking their market shares to 5.6% and 4% respectively. Morrisons, which has a market share of 10.9%, was the best performer of the big four grocers for the third period in a row with sales falling by just 0.1%. The Kantar figures will be a boost for the new chief executive, David Potts, who is on a mission to improve sales and profits after taking over in March.",

    "webTitle": "UK GDP growth: we have rarely had it so good, apparently", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a sluggish first quarter, the UK economy got going again in the second quarter, with signs even that the long-awaited recovery in living standards is taking root. Chancellor George Osborne says Britain is \u201cmotoring ahead\u201d, which is an interesting choice of words given manufacturing shrank. However, he is right that the headlines from Tuesday\u2019s growth figures tell a generally happy tale. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, powered by the services sector, GDP grew 0.7% in the second quarter after just 0.4% in the first. It means the UK economy has now been expanding for 10 consecutive quarters. That is the third-longest spell of growth since 1955 and economists at Royal Bank of Scotland say \u201cwe\u2019ve rarely had it so good\u201d. The ONS says GDP per head, generally taken as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP, is \u201cbroadly equal\u201d to the pre-crisis peak reached in early 2008. Does it feel like it? Well, it depends, of course, very much on who you are and what you do. And here we come back to what is powering the growth and what is not. If you are enjoying the happy combination of virtually no inflation alongside a post-crisis pay rise, you might be feeling quite flush. If you are a young person struggling to get a job or someone stuck in one of Britain\u2019s many low-paid service sector jobs, chances are the claims from Osborne that his \u201ceconomic plan is working\u201d will ring hollow. GDP tells only part of the story on the economy and that is even more true for this first stab at estimating growth in the second quarter, when the ONS has less than half the data it needs. Similarly, average pay figures provide only a rough guide to how workers are doing. Behind the headlines there are worrying signs that the spoils of Britain\u2019s seemingly booming jobs market are not being shared equally. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned about this as he makes the case for holding off a potentially damaging early interest rate rise. \u201cThere are still people without a job who would like a job; there are still people with jobs who would like to work more hours. And, even for those that have got jobs, their pay \u2013 in most cases \u2013 isn\u2019t racing away,\u201d he told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight last week. The latest analysis of what jobs are available gives yet more reasons for caution. Advertised salaries have fallen to an 11-month low, as growth in the workforce is driven by lower-paid roles and part-time positions, according to jobs search engine Adzuna.co.uk which aims to list every vacancy advertised. These latest GDP figures underline the very British addiction to low-paid labour rather than more innovative and productive economic activity. For all the government\u2019s pledges to rebalance the economy, the dominant services sector is the only part of Britain\u2019s economy to be back to its pre-crisis peak. So while the chancellor talks about \u201cmotoring ahead\u201d, manufacturing has some way to go to recover ground lost in the downturn. The latest news is gloomy, Britain\u2019s factories recorded a 0.3% drop in the latest three months, the ONS says. Construction, meanwhile, stagnated. So yes, there are undoubtedly signs of the overall economy strengthening in these latest numbers. But for anyone looking to the long-term, the figures show this recovery is anything but broad-based.",

In recent weeks, as China\u2019s stock market falls appeared to stabilise, millions of individual investors seemed assured that state intervention to halt the stock market slide had worked. Then, on Monday, the Shanghai stock market suffered its biggest one-day loss since 2007. On Tuesday, the Changle Lu branch of Zheshang Securities was busy with around 30 people hunched over computer terminal screens showing share prices. Many of the terminals were displaying green, which in China means losses, with red representing gains. Some of the brokerage customers were frantically punching buttons as if playing on games consoles. This particular stock market game has resulted in serious financial losses for some investors. Most did not want to talk about how much they had lost or whether they still had faith in the government. Questions were batted away with a resigned wave of a hand. One middle-aged man was leaning over a terminal with his hand on his head in what looked like despair. Heated discussions broke out between four people nearby, apparently discussing which types of stocks were performing better. Three unhappy-looking women were sitting on orange plastic chairs taking a break from trading. \u201cEveryone is in a bad mood because they are losing money,\u201d said one of the women who did not want to be named. \u201cToday is not a good day to be asking these questions,\u201d she added angrily. Mr Yuan, standing across the room, was calmly entering data on a computer terminal, deciding what to sell. \u201cI personally have not lost a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI have sold out all the stocks that I held.\u201d Although he thought the government should take further action, he didn\u2019t think this week\u2019s losses showed the government\u2019s intervention had necessarily failed. China\u2019s stock market \u201cis like a psycho \u2013 it has been up and down too great a degree,\u201d he said, adding that investors had become greedy and did not have a \u201cstabilised attitude\u201d to the market. Mr Zhou nearby was also standing over a screen, eager to stress he had not lost money, prompting a sceptical laugh from a woman at the neighbouring terminal. He does not blame the government for the ongoing volatility. \u201cThe stock market has its own way to function,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether the country [intervenes] or not, it has not much to do with the stock market.\u201d Both Zhou and Yuan said that the Chinese stock markets had changed and that big profits can no longer be made. \u201cWe should focus on short-term investment,\u201d said Yuan. Zhou outlined his new strategy: \u201cYou buy in when it\u2019s 5 yuan, you sell out when it\u2019s 7 yuan and you gain 2 yuan. That\u2019s it.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic growth bounced back in the second quarter of the year, fanning the debate about the timing of the first rise in interest rates since the financial crisis. Growth in the three months to June stood at 0.7%, according to official figures, following a below-par rise of 0.4% in the first quarter. The second-quarter number was in line with City expectations, but the services sector fuelled the growth as manufacturing declined, prompting warnings from economists that the recovery is being powered by a two-speed economy. There were signs, however, that living standards are returning to their pre-crisis levels after the Office for National Statistics said GDP per head was now \u201cbroadly equal\u201d to the first quarter of 2008, before the banking crisis drove the UK into recession. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said growth was unbalanced. \u201cThe services sector drove the rise in GDP, while construction output was flat and manufacturing output fell. But at least it looks as though productivity growth is continuing to pick up,\u201d she said. Economists were looking for clues for the timing of change to interest rates, which have been at a low of 0.5% since March 2009, after the warning earlier this month from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, that a rise in interest rates was \u201cmoving closer\u201d. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will be giving its view on rates on 6 August, amid expectations that there could be a split among its nine members. \u201cWe suspect that two members of the MPC may well vote for a rate hike in August although there may not be critical mass until February next year,\u201d said James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING. The strength of sterling was blamed by some economists for the 0.3% fall in the manufacturing sector, and after the data was released the pound rose again against the dollar and the euro as investors continued to bet on an interest rate rise perhaps as soon as the end of the year. \u201cSterling strength has clearly been a key driver behind the re-emergence of the two-speed economy, making life more difficult for export focused UK manufacturers,\u201d said Victoria Clarke at stockbrokers Investec. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s economic plan is not delivering what was promised. We were told there would be a march of the makers, but instead manufacturing continues to decline. And while there is a desperate need for affordable homes, construction output remains in the doldrums.\u201d The CBI, the employers\u2019 body, also pointed to the struggle to achieve manufacturing growth. \u201cPerformance is mixed across sectors, with UK manufacturers going through a tough time as the stronger pound hits sales into the eurozone. Meanwhile, the eurozone is still grappling with uncertainty over the Greek bailout,\u201d said Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis. However, the chancellor, George Osborne, tweeted that the data \u201cshows Britain motoring ahead with the economy producing as much per head as ever before. We must stay on road we\u2019ve set out on.\u201d The services sector rose 0.7% \u2013 contributing 0.5 percentage points of the increase on the previous quarter \u2013 while production was up by 1% as a rise in oil and gas outweighed the fall in manufacturing. Agriculture decreased by 0.7%. Year-on-year, GDP was 2.6% higher. The ONS said the second quarter was 5.2% higher than the pre-downturn peak of January to March 2008. From that peak at the start of 2008 to the trough \u2013 the second quarter of 2009 \u2013 the economy shrank by 6%, it said. Knightley said: \u201cThe UK economy is now 5.2% larger than its pre-recession peak and GDP/capita is back to those early 2008 levels. Consequently, the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy continues to shrink. This is now translating into rising wage pressures and growing talk from Bank of England officials that interest rate rises may not be that far away.\u201d Clarke noted that any rate rise might push sterling higher, causing more difficulties for manufacturers, while the headline growth in GDP was showing that momentum was building in the economy. The data, she added, \u201cunderlines the dilemma of sorts that the MPC faces in guiding markets on its policy stance ahead and particularly on its likely path to rates liftoff\u201d.",

We were told there would be a march of the makers, but instead manufacturing continues to decline. And while there is a desperate need for affordable homes, construction output remains in the doldrums.\u201d</p> <p>The CBI, the employers\u2019 body, also pointed to the struggle to achieve manufacturing growth. \u201cPerformance is mixed across sectors, with UK manufacturers going through a tough time as the stronger pound hits sales into the eurozone. Meanwhile, the eurozone is still grappling with uncertainty over the Greek bailout,\u201d said Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis.</p> <p>However, the chancellor, George Osborne, tweeted that the data \u201cshows Britain motoring ahead with the economy producing as much per head as ever before. We must stay on road we\u2019ve set out on.\u201d</p> <p>The services sector rose 0.7% \u2013 contributing 0.5 percentage points of the increase on the previous quarter \u2013 while production was up by 1% as a rise in oil and gas outweighed the fall in manufacturing. Agriculture decreased by 0.7%. </p> <p>Year-on-year, GDP was 2.6% higher. The ONS said the second quarter was 5.2% higher than the pre-downturn peak of January to March 2008. From that peak at the start of 2008 to the trough \u2013 the second quarter of 2009 \u2013 the economy shrank by 6%, it said.</p> <p>Knightley said: \u201cThe UK economy is now 5.2% larger than its pre-recession peak and GDP/capita is back to those early 2008 levels. Consequently, the amount of spare capacity in the UK economy continues to shrink. This is now translating into rising wage pressures and growing talk from Bank of England officials that interest rate rises may not be that far away.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke noted that any rate rise might push sterling higher, causing more difficulties for manufacturers, while the headline growth in GDP was showing that momentum was building in the economy. The data, she added, \u201cunderlines the dilemma of sorts that the MPC faces in guiding markets on its policy stance ahead and particularly on its likely path to rates liftoff\u201d.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has moved to draw a line under the Deepwater Horizon disaster after slumping to a $6.3bn (\u00a34bn) loss for the second quarter owing to costs linked to the oil spill. The UK oil company slid into the red after taking an extra $10.8bn charge relating to the accident in the Gulf of Mexico five years ago. This provision follows the $18.7bn legal settlement reached by BP earlier this month to cover US federal, state and local claims. The latest charge means the disaster has now cost BP $54.6bn since 2010. However, Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said the legal settlement \u2013 which represents the largest environmental fine in US history \u2013 was a \u201clandmark step forward for all parties\u201d. He added: \u201cThe numbers are huge but we can now plan for the future. That is a state we haven\u2019t been in for five years.\u201d The legal settlement involves the company making the payments over the next 18 years. It is likely to be formally approved by US courts early next year, although BP has already started making payments and says it expects the settlement to be ratified. Dudley said the deal could also shield the company from a hostile takeover, with deal speculation rife in the industry after Royal Dutch Shell agreed a \u00a347bn takeover of BG Group. He said: \u201cAs a result of the settlement in the US. it is actually less likely that someone would want to acquire BP and it is certainly not our intention to put the company up for sale.\u201d Shares in BP rose 5.3p, or 1.4%, to 392.65p following the announcement of its second-quarter results, despite the loss and the company reporting that underlying profits were lower than expected. The Deepwater Horizon bill led to BP recording a replacement cost loss \u2013 the benchmark measure for the oil industry \u2013 of $6.3bn for the quarter and $4.2bn for the first half of 2015. This compares witha profit of $3.2bn in the second quarter of last year and $6.7bn in the first half. Stripping out the Deepwater Horizon costs and other one-off items, BP said that underlying replacement cost-profit fell 64% year-on-year in the second quarter to $1.3bn. This was worse than the $1.6bn expected by City analysts, but Dudley blamed the underperformance on a $600m hit to BP\u2019s exploration business in Libya from write-offs and unexpected costs. \u201cIt is hard for us to get something done right now,\u201d he said of Libya. \u201cWe are not sure who the national oil company is.\u201d Energy groups are under pressure after a slump in the oil price, which has forced the sector to make thousands of job cuts around the world. The price of Brent crude averaged $62 a barrel in the second quarter of 2015, compared with $110 in the same period a year earlier. Dudley said BP were \u201cresetting the company for a sustained weaker environment\u201d and that it was a really tough time for the industry. The company is working on the assumption that the oil price remains between $60 and $65 a barrel for the \u201cshort and medium term\u201d. Dudley added: \u201cIn the past few weeks oil prices have fallen back in response to continued oversupply and market weakness and the recent agreements regarding Iran. I am confident that positioning BP for a period of weaker prices is the right course to take, and will serve the company well for the future.\u201d As a consequence, BP now expects capital expenditure to be below $20bn for the year after previously stating it would hit the $20bn mark. Capital expenditure was $8.9bn in the first half compared with $11bn in the same period last year. Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cAlthough there can be some seasonality with capital expenditure, we could potentially see a further downward revision later in the year.\u201d The collapse in the oil price has sparked concerns about the future of the North Sea oil and gas industry. Dudley said the industry had experienced a \u201cshock to the system\u201d and that the North Sea was a \u201cproblem child in terms of efficiency\u201d. However, despite a number of projects being decommissioned, he said it was encouraging that oil rigs were becoming more efficient. Nonetheless, BP revealed it now expects restructuring costs to hit $1.5bn in 2015, compared with initial expectations of $1bn as it cuts jobs around the world, including in Aberdeen. BP\u2019s workforce has fallen by 5,000, from 80,000 at the end of last year, although some of this reduction is due to the sale of assets. The company is aiming to sell $10bn of assets this year to help insulate it from the oil price fall and has already sold-off $7.4bn. This sell-off is on top of the $38bn-worth that BP sold in response to the Gulf disaster. Royal Dutch Shell and Centrica, the parent of British Gas and the owner of a North Sea operation, are also expected to warn about the squeeze on the industry when they report figures this week.",

      "bodyText": "Beijing has vowed to step up its interventions in China\u2019s volatile stock market following a traumatic day on Monday when stocks suffered their greatest losses since 2007. A government-controlled stock-buying agency would \u201ccontinue to buy stocks to stabilise the market\u201d, said Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesperson with China\u2019s security\u2019s regulator, the CSRC. The regulator was also now investigating \u201chuge stock sell-offs by some individuals and will punish any malicious short selling\u201d, Zhang added, according to Xinhua, Beijing\u2019s official news agency. Asian stocks fell to three-week lows on Tuesday morning, as a deepening rout in Chinese stocks erased risk appetite \u2013 sending investors flocking to safe-haven instruments such as government bonds and the Japanese yen. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8% in early deals, its lowest level since 9 July, as mainland Chinese indexes opened 2% to 5% lower. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei fell more than 1%, with a strong yen accelerating the decline. Australian shares fell 0.9% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi shed 1%. Despite the government\u2019s pledge to continue propping up the stock market, analysts warned those measures were not succeeding in boosting confidence. Rajiv Biswas, the chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cSome sort of correction had to happen and is happening and there is probably not a lot they can do to prevent a significant further drop. \u201cEven if they do announce monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus measures, it is going to take some time before those really have any impact on the economy,\u201d Biswas added. \u201cThere are a lot of different parts of the economy that are showing weakness and the collapse of the stock market is just another symptom of the fragility of the Chinese economy right now.\u201d Following three weeks of relative calm, the Shanghai Composite Index plummeted on Monday, ending down 8.5% at 3725.56 \u2013 its worst fall since February 2007. Meanwhile the Shenzhen index dropped nearly 7.6% to close at 12493.05 points. The latest day of frenzied selling \u2013 which analysts said reflected weaker economic data out of China as well as a lack of confidence in Beijing\u2019s response to ongoing stock market chaos \u2013 was a slap in the face for the country\u2019s Communist party leaders. Beijing launched an unprecedented push to prop up the country\u2019s stock market after a collapse that began in mid-June saw more than $3tn wiped off the value of listed companies. Until Monday, those efforts, which also included freezing IPOs, appeared to have brought some measure of stability. Reuters contributed to this report.",

Australian shares fell 0.9% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi shed 1%.<br></p> <p>Despite the government\u2019s pledge to continue propping up the stock market, analysts warned those measures were not succeeding in boosting confidence. </p> <p>Rajiv Biswas, the chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cSome sort of correction had to happen and is happening and there is probably not a lot they can do to prevent a significant further drop.</p> <p>\u201cEven if they do announce monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus measures, it is going to take some time before those really have any impact on the economy,\u201d Biswas added.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of different parts of the economy that are showing weakness and the collapse of the stock market is just another symptom of the fragility of the Chinese economy right now.\u201d</p> <p>Following three weeks of relative calm, the Shanghai Composite Index <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/chinese-stock-markets-slide-as-investors-panic-again\">plummeted on Monday</a>, ending down 8.5% at 3725.56 \u2013 its worst fall since February 2007. Meanwhile the Shenzhen index dropped nearly 7.6% to close at 12493.05 points.</p> <p>The latest day of frenzied selling \u2013 which analysts said reflected weaker economic data out of China as well as a lack of confidence in Beijing\u2019s response to ongoing stock market chaos \u2013 was a slap in the face for the country\u2019s Communist party leaders. Beijing launched an unprecedented push to prop up the country\u2019s stock market after a collapse that began in mid-June saw more than $3tn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/chinese-investors-despair-as-gains-wiped-out-in-tumbling-stock-market\">wiped off the value of listed companies</a>.</p> <p>Until Monday, those efforts, which also included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/05/china-freezes-new-share-offers-in-bid-to-shore-up-plunging-stock-markets\">freezing IPOs</a>, appeared to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/10/china-stock-market-rebounds-second-day\">brought some measure of stability</a>.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report.</em></p>",
