      "bodyText": "The US may have seen its two best years of job growth since the late 90s, but according to the labor secretary, Tom Perez, the American people still need a raise. The last time the federal minimum wage went up was in July 2009. It has stayed at $7.25, even as Barack Obama has called on Congress to raise it to $10.10 and then $12 an hour. Perez said on Friday the minimum wage was \u201con the front burner and it\u2019s sizzling, for us, because Americans need a raise\u201d. In 2015, wages increased by 2.5%. In order for the lowest-earning Americans to feel the impact, that rate of growth would have to be between 3% and 4%. The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve both expect the job market to continue to strengthen. According to Perez, as unemployment goes down companies will have to raise wages to attract the best candidates. \u201cAnd on a federal level, one of two things will happen,\u201d he told the Guardian, after his department announced that the US economy had added 292,000 jobs in December, exceeding expectations. \u201cWe will see a raise in minimum wage this year and we are going to continue to fight for that. Or those who oppose it will do it at their own peril. \u201cI have been to red states and blue states and what they all have in common is that you cannot live on $7.25 an hour. That\u2019s why you are seeing states like South Dakota and Nebraska raise their minimum wage. And you shouldn\u2019t have to win the geographic lottery to get out of poverty wages.\u201d The Republican stance on minimum wages came back into the spotlight in late December, when presidential frontrunner Donald Trump appeared to change his position. \u201cWages in are [sic] country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders. We need smart and strong leadership now!\u201d Trump tweeted on 28 December, weeks after the fourth Republican debate, in which he said that wages were too high and that the minimum wage should remain at $7.25. Asked if the economy would feature in Obama\u2019s final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Perez said: \u201cOf course. \u201cThe economy continues to be job one at the Labor Department. And the president, every day, is waking up asking the questions: how can I build not just a better economy, but a better America where we have shared prosperity?\u201d Some remain skeptical about whether strong job growth can continue, after the US economy added 2.65m jobs in 2015. Some economists attributed the better-than-expected December report to the warm weather. Perez dismissed that, saying much of the growth had been in sectors with indoor jobs. \u201cThe sectors that have done best are business and professional services and education and health,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, my kid\u2019s teachers teach indoors. My accountant doesn\u2019t work in her backyard. \u201cThe broad-base nature of our growth right now is a really solid indicator that we are building an economy that can remain strong and resilient and resistant to weather headwinds or China headwinds. We have proven that we are incredibly resilient in this country.\u201d US stock markets have not proved resilient to economic turmoil in China. On 4 January, the markets opened with their worst performance since 2008, and both the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 went on to have their worst opening week in history. By Friday, the Dow Jones was down 6.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was down 6%. Nasdaq had its worst opening week since 2008, losing 8%.",

      "bodyText": "When the European Central Bank announced a smaller-than-expected stimulus plan last month, Brevan Howard, one of Europe\u2019s largest hedge funds, was one of the biggest casualties. Its master fund is said to have lost $670m after misreading the runes. From being ahead on the year by 2.4%, the fund went 1.2% behind and finished the year down 1.99%, according to figures that came out last week. The performance, though not dismal, must have disappointed investors. But if anybody expected such an event to have any financial impact on the firm\u2019s partners, they have now have been disabused of that notion. According to a filing from Companies House, the company\u2019s UK unit paid \u00a3120.6m in compensation, up from \u00a385.3m in the previous year, to its partners. The number of partners averaged 37 in the year, down from 45, meaning they were paid an average of \u00a33.3m. The hedge fund\u2019s filing coincided with Fat Cat Tuesday, the day on which the average FTSE chief executive will have earned more than the average British worker does in a year. The average chief executive\u2019s salary is now \u00a34.96m a year, so Brevan Howard\u2019s partners didn\u2019t make as much as that \u2013 but then they don\u2019t have to face the same level of public scrutiny as their public-company counterparts. Brevan Howard says traders are paid on a performance basis and therefore those that did well were paid accordingly. It adds that some of those who contributed to the underperformance of its main fund might not be represented by the latest accounts, which is for the UK unit only. Outside the industry there is widespread scepticism about the high fees charged, both in good and bad times, by hedge fund operators. \u201cVery high rewards for good performance are only really justified if there are penalties for bad performance,\u201d says Ruth Bender, who researches corporate governance for the Cranfield School of Management. Partners at Brevan Howard have continued with the traditional hedge fund practice of charging 20% of any profits they make for clients alongside a fixed fee of 2%. The twittersphere was full of incredulity over Brevan Howard\u2019s numbers. \u201cAll that is wrong with hedge funds,\u201d said one commenter. Brevan Howard\u2019s co-founder Alan Howard, whose personal fortune is estimated at \u00a31.5bn by the Sunday Times Rich List and who is normally one of the more media-shy hedge fund managers, raised his profile when he quit the UK for Geneva in 2010. His move to low-tax Switzerland, followed by half his employees, was blamed on the threat of tighter EU regulation of hedge funds. Recently, however, some of those that departed have returned to London, unimpressed by living overseas. Another of Brevan Howard\u2019s co-founders was star fund manager Chris Rokos, who left in 2012 after generating a total of $4bn for the firm. Brevan Howard maintains a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in Rokos\u2019s new firm. The two parties earlier settled a lawsuit brought by Rokos over an employment agreement which would have prevented him from managing investors\u2019 money until 2018. UK-based hedge funds as a whole ended the year some 2% higher than 12 months earlier, according to Preqin, a financial data company. But during the past few months a number of hedge funds have closed to outside investors, as their investment returns have faltered. Last week Nevsky Capital joined hedge fund firms such as billionaire Michael Platt\u2019s BlueCrest Capital Management, Seneca Capital and SAB Capital Management in returning money to clients and adding to an accelerating trend of hedge funds shutting down globally. Brevan Howard says it always does better when there\u2019s some movement in interest rates, so is expecting better days ahead after the US Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for the first time in almost a decade. The firm also expects the closure of the BlueCrest fund to be a blessing. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a bunch of new investors in the master fund,\u201d an insider says. So maybe a better year ahead for Brevan Howard\u2019s investors? No doubt its traders will have a pretty good one too \u2013 again.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rarely have financial markets had a more traumatic start to the year. Shares plunged, the price of oil clattered to its lowest level in 11 years, trading on the Chinese stock market was halted twice, and the World Bank warned that a \u201cperfect storm\u201d might be brewing. George Osborne chose his moment well to go public with his concern that the UK faces a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d. In addition to the $2tn wiped off global stock markets, the North Koreans claimed they had exploded a hydrogen bomb and relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran worsened markedly. On the face of it, there seems no reason why the global markets should remain depressed. Rising oil prices have traditionally been associated with recessions, so a drop of more than two-thirds in the cost of a barrel of crude should, logically, be good for growth. Cheaper energy means lower costs for businesses and additional spending power for consumers. There are winners and losers from a falling oil price but on balance the impact should be positive. What\u2019s more, it could be that the gloom about China is overdone. The slowdown in the rate of growth is not just intentional but desirable. Should the economy cool more quickly than planned, Beijing has plenty of power to ensure there is no hard landing: it can boost public spending; it can push the currency lower to boost exports; it can cut interest rates. Trading on the Chinese stock market was a farce. \u201cCircuit breakers\u201d were introduced at the start of the year to prevent turbulence, used twice to stop investors selling shares, and then abruptly dumped at the end of last week. But the chaos needs to be put into perspective. Only the rich play on the Chinese stock market and their activities have little bearing on corporate investment. Share prices rose by 150% between June 2014 and May 2015: events since have seen the froth blown off the market, but the wider implications for China, let alone the rest of the world, are negligible. The US-based fund manager Blackrock remains sanguine about the prospects for 2016, seeing events of the past week as akin to the brief period of turmoil last August rather than the start of a bear market. \u201cOn balance, the US economy is in decent shape (outside of manufacturing) and economic conditions in Europe are improving as well. The declines in these markets may have more to do with sentiment than substance,\u201d it said. There is, though, an alternative \u2013 and much darker \u2013 interpretation of the events of the past week, which begins and ends with China. Rapid growth in what is now the world\u2019s second-biggest economy helped prevent a second Great Depression in 2008-09, but there was a heavy price to pay. China spent public money lavishly \u2013 often on pointless projects \u2013 and by making credit cheap and abundant it set off a property boom. There has been misallocation of capital on a colossal scale, resulting in empty office blocks and unproductive factories. Laura Eaton of Fathom Consulting says Beijing has hit the panic button: \u201cIn our view, the ongoing series of stimulus measures employed by the Chinese government merely highlights their discomfort. Quite simply, we believe that their actions belie their words. China is suffering a hard landing.\u201d Eaton expects the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency aggressively over the coming months. The impact of that would be to flood the global economy with cut-price Chinese goods, putting added pressure on competing developing nations and turning ultra-low inflation to outright deflation in the west. All this would happen at a time when other central banks and finance ministries are low on ammunition. In previous economic cycles, countries have gone into recessions with healthy public finances and relatively high levels of interest rates. That has allowed public spending to rise, taxes to be cut and the cost of borrowing to be lowered. Almost seven years into the recovery from the downturn of 2008-09, interest rates in the developed world are barely above zero and the repair job on public finances remains unfinished. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last week the global economy would remain fragile in 2016. She said there was likely to be an \u201cincreased divergence\u201d in monetary policy in developed countries. The fund thinks the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will be providing extra stimulus at a time when the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are pushing up interest rates. In the past, this has tended to be a recipe for trouble in the markets. Lagarde also predicted that China\u2019s attempt to rebalance its economy towards consumer spending rather than exports would prove a bumpy process rather than a trouble-free one: the transition was leading to lower demand for commodities, with knock-on effects for those countries producing oil and industrial metals. Pressures on commodity producers are already evident. Russia and Brazil are in recession; Saudi Arabia has announced an austerity budget and is planning to sell a stake in its state-owned oil company Aramco. If the Saudis are feeling the pinch from an oil price that has fallen from $115 a barrel in August 2014 to $33 a barrel on Friday, other countries in the emerging world are probably getting close to breaking point. The last time the developing world was in crisis, Alan Greenspan, the then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, rode to the rescue with cuts in interest rates. The dotcom bubble resulted, and when that went pop Greenspan responded by again slashing interest rates. That led to the US sub-prime housing bubble. When that went pop, China came to the rescue while the west sorted out its wrecked banking system. So what happens if the first week of 2016 is more than a temporary wobble? More quantitative easing? Negative interest rates? Helicopter drops of money? Nobody really knows. As Sir Alex Ferguson once said: this is squeaky bum time.",

      "body": "<p>Rarely have financial markets had a more traumatic start to the year. Shares plunged, the price of oil clattered to its lowest level in 11 years, trading on the Chinese stock market was halted twice, and the World Bank warned that a \u201cperfect storm\u201d might be brewing.</p> <p>George Osborne chose his moment well to go public with his concern that the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/07/george-osborne-warns-uk-economy-faces-cocktail-of-threats\" title=\"\">faces a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d</a>. In addition to the $2tn wiped off global stock markets, the North Koreans claimed they had exploded a hydrogen bomb and relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran worsened markedly.</p> <p>On the face of it, there seems no reason why the global markets should remain depressed. Rising oil prices have traditionally been associated with recessions, so a drop of more than two-thirds in the cost of a barrel of crude should, logically, be good for growth. Cheaper energy means lower costs for businesses and additional spending power for consumers. There are winners and losers from a falling oil price but on balance the impact should be positive.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it could be that the gloom about China is overdone. The slowdown in the rate of growth is not just intentional but desirable. Should the economy cool more quickly than planned, Beijing has plenty of power to ensure there is no hard landing: it can boost public spending; it can push the currency lower to boost exports; it can cut interest rates.</p> <p>Trading on the Chinese stock market was a farce. \u201cCircuit breakers\u201d were introduced at the start of the year to prevent turbulence, used twice to stop investors selling shares, and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/china-suspends-mechanism-ending-stock-market-turmoil\" title=\"\">abruptly dumped at the end of last week</a>. But the chaos needs to be put into perspective. Only the rich play on the Chinese stock market and their activities have little bearing on corporate investment. Share prices rose by 150% between June 2014 and May 2015: events since have seen the froth blown off the market, but the wider implications for China, let alone the rest of the world, are negligible.</p> <p>The US-based fund manager Blackrock remains sanguine about the prospects for 2016, seeing events of the past week as akin to the brief period of turmoil last August rather than the start of a bear market. \u201cOn balance, the US economy is in decent shape (outside of manufacturing) and economic conditions in Europe are improving as well. The declines in these markets may have more to do with sentiment than substance,\u201d it said.</p> <p>There is, though, an alternative \u2013 and much darker \u2013 interpretation of the events of the past week, which begins and ends with China.</p> <p>Rapid growth in what is now the world\u2019s second-biggest economy helped prevent a second Great Depression in 2008-09, but there was a heavy price to pay. China spent public money lavishly \u2013 often on pointless projects \u2013 and by making credit cheap and abundant it set off a property boom. There has been misallocation of capital on a colossal scale, resulting in empty office blocks and unproductive factories.</p> <p>Laura Eaton of Fathom Consulting says Beijing has hit the panic button: \u201cIn our view, the ongoing series of stimulus measures employed by the Chinese government merely highlights their discomfort. Quite simply, we believe that their actions belie their words. China is suffering a hard landing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef67a6c4c8f4b83a7beafea68e43beae7999e4c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef67a6c4c8f4b83a7beafea68e43beae7999e4c1/0_0_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Lagarde\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Lagarde has warned of \u2018increased divergence\u2019 in the global economy between those countries in a position to raise interest rates and those still using emergency economic measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Jaffe/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eaton expects the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency aggressively over the coming months. The impact of that would be to flood the global economy with cut-price Chinese goods, putting added pressure on competing developing nations and turning ultra-low inflation to outright deflation in the west.</p> <p>All this would happen at a time when other central banks and finance ministries are low on ammunition. In previous economic cycles, countries have gone into recessions with healthy public finances and relatively high levels of interest rates. That has allowed public spending to rise, taxes to be cut and the cost of borrowing to be lowered. Almost seven years into the recovery from the downturn of 2008-09, interest rates in the developed world are barely above zero and the repair job on public finances remains unfinished.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last week the global economy would remain fragile in 2016. She said there was likely to be an \u201cincreased divergence\u201d in monetary policy in developed countries. The fund thinks the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will be providing extra stimulus at a time when the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are pushing up interest rates. In the past, this has tended to be a recipe for trouble in the markets.</p> <p>Lagarde also predicted that China\u2019s attempt to rebalance its economy towards consumer spending rather than exports would prove a bumpy process rather than a trouble-free one: the transition was leading to lower demand for commodities, with knock-on effects for those countries producing oil and industrial metals.</p> <p>Pressures on commodity producers are already evident. Russia and Brazil are in recession; Saudi Arabia has announced an austerity budget and is planning to sell a stake in its state-owned oil company Aramco. If the Saudis are feeling the pinch from an oil price that has fallen from $115 a barrel in August 2014 to $33 a barrel on Friday, other countries in the emerging world are probably getting close to breaking point.</p> <p>The last time the developing world was in crisis, Alan Greenspan, the then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, rode to the rescue with cuts in interest rates. The dotcom bubble resulted, and when that went pop Greenspan responded by again slashing interest rates. That led to the US sub-prime housing bubble. When that went pop, China came to the rescue while the west sorted out its wrecked banking system.</p> <p>So what happens if the first week of 2016 is more than a temporary wobble? More quantitative easing? Negative interest rates? Helicopter drops of money? Nobody really knows. As Sir Alex Ferguson once said: this is squeaky bum time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Anna said, as she screwed up a brown paper bag that had contained a steak and black bean Chipotle burrito. \u201cIf I die, I die.\u201d Anna, who had wolfed down her lunch in a Manhattan branch of the fast food chain, said she would continue to visit Chipotle at least twice a week despite the Mexican grill chain having been struck by outbreaks of E coli and norovirus that left more than 500 sickened across 12 states, according to Food Safety News. No one died. But while Anna, who declined to provide her surname, is unfaltering in her loyalty, Chipotle is haemorrhaging customers and with them revenue, profits, market share and its hard-fought reputation for \u201cfood with integrity\u201d. The company, which was until recently a Wall Street darling, this week warned investors that sales had dropped 30% in December and had been down as much as 37% immediately following reports of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigations. Its investors are angry. On Friday, they funnelled that anger into a class action lawsuit claiming the company and its founder and co-chief executive, Steve Ells, made \u201cmaterially false and misleading statements\u201d about Chipotle\u2019s food safety controls in the wake of the outbreaks. The lawsuit, filed in US district court for the southern district of New York, accuses Chipotle of failing to disclose that its \u201cquality controls were inadequate to safeguard consumer and employee health\u201d. It alleges that Chipotle executives misled investors and the public about the severity of the outbreaks with a \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d. Chipotle has been served with a grand jury subpoena as a part of a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration into a norovirus outbreak at a restaurant in California this summer that sickened at least 234 customers and employees. The company was severed with the subpoena in December, but only informed its investors about it on 6 January. The lawsuit claims that Ells and other Chipotle executives were \u201cpersonally motivated to make false statements and omit material information necessary to make the statements not misleading in order to personally benefit from the sale of Chipotle securities from their personal portfolios\u201d. Chipotle declined to comment about the lawsuit, which seeks damages for investors who bought shares in the company between February 2015 and January 2016. It claims investors would not have bought shares if they had known how bad the outbreaks really were. The company expects sales over the last three months of 2015 to be down 14.6% \u2013 the company\u2019s first quarter of negative growth since it was spun out of McDonald\u2019s in 2006. It estimates that fourth-quarter earnings will come in at $1.70-1.90 per share, compared to analysts\u2019 earlier predictions of $2.49. The announcements sent Chipotle\u2019s shares down 11% this week to $412.96 \u2013 their lowest point in more than two years. This time last year, Chipotle shares were changing hands at $720 \u2013 the equivalent of 85 $8.52 chicken burritos. Now you could pick up a share for the equivalent of just 50 chicken burritos. While Ells has apologised to customers in full-page adverts in more than 60 newspapers across the US, analysts reckon it will take a long time for Chipotle to get its mojo back at a time when burger juggernaut McDonald\u2019s is powering back from its recent crisis. \u201cI\u2019d like to take this opportunity to apologize on behalf of all of us at Chipotle,\u201d Ells said in the sombre black and white adverts. \u201cThe fact that anyone has become ill eating at Chipotle is completely unacceptable to me and I am deeply sorry.\u201d He said he would ensure that the company, which has more than 1,900 outlets worldwide including seven in London, would take all steps necessary \u201cto be sure all of the food we serve is as safe as it can be\u201d. Analysts have repeatedly cut their price targets on Chipotle, and Barclays warned this week that \u201cgiven the series of negative headlines and outsized media/social attention, we believe the time frame for a complete Chipotle recovery is extended.\u201d Industry experts reckon Chipotle will find it harder to bounce back than other fast food restaurants because it has put so much emphasis on the quality, freshness and healthiness of its food. \u201cThey have taken a premium spot in the market, with claims of better and more cared for meat,\u201d said Patty Johnson, global food analyst at market research firm Mintel. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit arrogant \u2013 \u2018We are better than others\u2019 \u2013 and there is a tendency to knock them down a notch. \u201cThere is an element of industry folks who think that it is all pretty much smoke and mirrors to get people to pay more, and now they are trying to make Chipotle pay. \u201cI think Chipotle has been groundbreaking in its efforts to try and source locally and have been at the forefront of trying to make meat more humane. But by doing so they have really put the spotlight on themselves.\u201d Admittedly it\u2019s a small sample, but every customer the Guardian spoke to in Chipotle in Manhattan\u2019s financial district this week was aware of the company\u2019s recent food scares but was still happily tucking into burritos and tacos. \u201cYes, I know all about the E coli,\u201d said Michelle, a 22-year-old project manager. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not happy about it, but I like burritos and it\u2019s really close to my office and now the lines are lot, lot shorter than they used to be.\u201d",
