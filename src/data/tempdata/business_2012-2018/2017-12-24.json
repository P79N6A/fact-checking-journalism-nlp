      "bodyText": "Walk down almost any major New York street \u2013 say Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, or Madison Avenue from midtown to the Upper East Side. Perhaps venture down Canal Street, or into the West Village around Bleecker, and some of the most expensive retail areas in the world are blitzed with vacant storefronts. The famed Lincoln Plaza Cinemas on the Upper West Side announced earlier this week that it is closing next month. A blow to the city\u2019s cinephiles, certainly, but also a sign of the effects that rapid gentrification, coupled with technological innovation, are having on the city. Over the past several years, thousands of small retailers have closed, replaced by national chains. When they, too, fail, the stores lie vacant, and landlords, often institutional investors, are unwilling to drop rents. A recent survey by New York councilmember Helen Rosenthal found 12% of stores on one stretch of the Upper West Side is unoccupied and \u2018for lease\u2019. The picture is repeated nationally. In October, the US surpassed the previous record for store closings, set after the 2008 financial crisis. The common refrain is that the devastation is the product of a profound shift in consumption to online, with Amazon frequently identified as the leading culprit. But this is maybe an over-simplification. \u201cIt\u2019s not Amazon, it\u2019s rent,\u201d says Jeremiah Moss, author of the website and book Vanishing New York. \u201cOver the decades, small businesses weathered the New York of the 70s with it near-bankruptcy and high crime. Businesses could survive the internet, but they need a reasonable rent to do that.\u201d Part of the problem is the changing make-up of New York landlords. Many are no longer mom-and-pop operations, but institutional investors and hedge funds that are unwilling to drop rents to match retail conditions. \u201cThey are running small businesses out of the city and replacing them with chain stores and temporary luxury businesses,\u201d says Moss. In addition, he says, banks will devalue a property if it\u2019s occupied by a small business, and increase it for a chain store. \u201cThere\u2019s benefit to waiting for chain stores. If you are a hedge fund manager running a portfolio you leave it empty and take a write-off.\u201d New York is famously a city of what author EB White called \u201ctiny neighborhood units\u201d is his classic 1949 essay Here is New York. White observed \u201cthat many a New Yorker spends a lifetime within the confines of an area smaller than a country village\u201d. In Vanishing New York, Moss writes of the toll the evisceration of distinct neighborhoods through real estate over-pricing has on the city. \u201cIt\u2019s homogenizing and changing the character of the city,\u201d he says. Even where landlords are offering competitive leases, they are often for two or five years, not the customary 10. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more stores front emptying, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of turnover where you see spaces fill temporarily and then empty. And it\u2019s continuing to get worse,\u201d he says. In business terms, the crisis in commercial real estate has led to a wave of consolidations. Earlier this month, France\u2019s Unibail-Rodamco and Australia\u2019s Westfield agreed to merge in a deal worth $24.7bn to form the world\u2019s second-biggest owner of shopping malls, including Manhattan\u2019s Brookfield Place. Vacant real estate is not the only effect of an over-priced market; the boom in WeWork, a work-space company valued at around $20bn, and store pop-ups could also be responsible. But some believe the market could have reached a turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s like Hunger Games,\u201d says New York retail property agent Robin Zendell. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart and innovative you can survive this market. Landlords and retailers are having to listen to a new generation of shoppers.\u201d Like Moss, Zendell believes it\u2019s too simplistic to blame Amazon. The same signals of over-pricing are seen in every area of real estate, including housing. \u201cWhen you see [that] every corner has a bank or a pharmacy, and there is a gym on the second floor, there\u2019s a simple reason for that: people can\u2019t afford the rent. \u201cWhy did restaurants go to Brooklyn? Because it\u2019s cool? No, because it was cheap, and [because] restaurateurs were sick of giving investors\u2019 money away so they could pay thir rent.\u201d In some areas, notably Bleecker Street, once lined with fashion boutiques including Ralph Lauren and Marc Jacobs, too many vacancies create their own problems. \u201cRents have fallen but now there are so many empty stores there, nobody wants to be alone. So they\u2019ve created more of a crisis.\u201d But there are glimmers of turn-around. Zendell has observed five deals in SoHo in the past month, indicating that landlords are becoming too nervous to sit around. \u201cThey helped to create the bubble, but now it\u2019s our market.\u201d Renters insist landlords have an investment in the game, either through taking a performance-based interest in the tenant or some other mechanism. Retailers that signed 10-year leases at a high number per sq ft and then had to pay to get out of that lease are insisting on some participation. \u201cAny new deal is going to have a pre-nup, the location has to be right, and the landlord has to have some skin in the game,\u201d says Zendell. Zendell also believes some retailers are beginning to find their way. She cites Everlane as an example of upcoming brand that is managing to harness the power of the internet to bricks-and-mortar retail. Online, she points out, is good for things you need, but less so for things you want. \u201cYou still need people and interaction, but you need a different approach: the modern customer is very smart. Brick and mortar used to be only about sales, now it\u2019s about marketing, driving people to the internet and for helping people to understand your product.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has attacked excessive boardroom pay as the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. The prime minister said in the summer that too many firms fell \u201cshort of the high standards we expect of them\u201d when they ignored the concerns of their shareholders by awarding pay rises to bosses that far outstrip the company\u2019s performance. Employers were also guilty of ignoring some of the most basic commitments made to their employees, she said. Understandably, the country expected some tough action to match the rhetoric. Last week, one of the initiatives bore fruit. The Investment Association, the trade body for the fund management industry, published the names of all the companies listed on the London stock exchange that suffered at least a 20% shareholder rebellion against proposals for executives pay, re-election of directors or other resolution at their shareholder meetings. The public register included on its list the fashion label Burberry, broadcaster Sky, retailer Sports Direct, estate agent Foxtons and Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s advertising company WPP. In the name of greater transparency, May will open a second line of attack in the form of rules obliging the same firms, many of them multinationals, to publish by next June the pay ratio between their chief executive and their average British worker. Chief executives\u2019 pay has soared in recent years. A study by the Equality Trust earlier this year found that the average FTSE chief executive earns 386 times more than a worker on the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The charity used annual reports from 2015 for all the companies in the FTSE 100 to calculate that their bosses pocket an average of \u00a35.3m a year, compared with \u00a313,662 for someone on the national living wage at the time of \u00a37.20 an hour. Naming those companies under attack from shareholders is considered by ministers to be a big step in handing workers the power to rein in excessive awards. Greg Clark, the business secretary, billed the changes as a \u201cworld-leading package of corporate governance reforms\u201d. Equality campaigners took a different view. They said businesses would emerge unscathed to award bosses extravagant bonuses much as before, especially after May watered down her plans, leaving out proposals for workers on boards. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said the government\u2019s proposals were \u201cjust more crony capitalism\u201d that failed to impose tough constraints on executive pay. There is a philosophical point to be made \u2013 that businesses should recover a moral dimension \u2013 that appears to be have been lost in the last 30 years of grasping executive pay awards. The 18th century economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith grounded his view that business should be left unfettered from government control in a belief that owners of capital would behave ethically. With this in mind, there could be no better way to end excessive pay than by appealing to the better nature of the company\u2019s bosses or the owners of the company\u2019s shares. For many people, this argument is stretched to incredulity by an insular management class who appear immune to embarrassment. They live in a world where few people seem to question high pay. Pension funds, desperate to fill their ballooning deficits, have a tendency to put bumper dividends payments above issues like executive rewards. The rules could be tougher, but they do raise a question: would people who have refused to voluntarily restrain top pay awards \u2013 that is, the majority of shareholders and directors \u2013 comply with new laws? Or would they join the trend to take companies private, away from the prying eyes of the public and the most stringent government rules? May has made provision for private companies to publish pay data, but this is voluntary. The temptation would be to have a mandatory rule that encompasses all forms of ownership, whether public or private. It is a temptation that ministers should embrace. Chilly reality awaits retailers after basking in Christmas glow Creditors usually wait for the Christmas spending spree to end before pulling the plug on struggling retailers and there is no reason to imagine that early 2018 will deviate from the normal pattern. It would be a miracle if Toys R Us, rescued last week, were to be the only company having financial difficulties at this time of year. After a surprisingly strong end to 2016, retailers have found life a lot tougher in 2017. Firstly, consumer spending has been subject to a nasty squeeze on real incomes, with prices rising faster than wages. The cannier households realised in the months following the EU referendum that the fall in the value of the pound would push up the cost of imports and brought forward purchases of big-ticket items. That helps explain why business was so brisk in the second half of 2016 and has been weak ever since. New car sales have been particularly soft. Secondly, retailers have seen their profits squeezed by an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage and by higher pension costs. They have sought to pass on higher costs to consumers, but this has not been all that easy when household budgets are under pressure. All this has come at a time when retailing is going through a profound change. Consumers know that they can save time and money by shopping online, and this has come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores. Life will get a bit easier in 2018, but not by all that much. The main effects of the pound\u2019s depreciation after the Brexit vote have now passed through the economy, so the annual inflation rate will come down from its current level of 3.1% over the coming months. Average earnings growth, currently running at an annual 2.3%, could also edge up a bit, boosting spending power. But the impact won\u2019t be dramatic. The economy has been over-reliant on consumer spending as the engine of growth, so some rebalancing towards investment and production is actually quite healthy. Retailers are unlikely to see it that way, though. Apple\u2019s admission on batteries drains its users\u2019 goodwill Apple claimed last week that it had had its customers\u2019 concerns at heart when it admitted what many users already suspected: the tech giant deliberately slows down older phones when their batteries start to struggle. An Apple spokesperson said: \u201cOur goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices.\u201d But they are no fools at Cupertino and they must have known what would come next: a lawsuit from disgruntled customers. Apple now has a public relations problem on its hands. Trust is an ever-relevant issue in the tech sector, from issues of privacy to the vulnerability of your online life to hackers. Apple has added to those concerns unnecessarily. It is unlikely that the battery story will have a material impact on sales, but it will make it harder to win back the public if the company encounters more serious problems in the future.",

Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said the government\u2019s proposals were \u201cjust more crony capitalism\u201d that failed to impose tough constraints on executive pay.</p> <p>There is a philosophical point to be made \u2013 that businesses should recover a moral dimension \u2013 that appears to be have been lost in the last 30 years of grasping executive pay awards. The 18th century economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith grounded his view that business should be left unfettered from government control in a belief that owners of capital would behave ethically. With this in mind, there could be no better way to end excessive pay than by appealing to the better nature of the company\u2019s bosses or the owners of the company\u2019s shares.</p> <p>For many people, this argument is stretched to incredulity by an insular management class who appear immune to embarrassment. They live in a world where few people seem to question high pay. Pension funds, desperate to fill their ballooning deficits, have a tendency to put bumper dividends payments above issues like executive rewards.</p> <p>The rules could be tougher, but they do raise a question: would people who have refused to voluntarily restrain top pay awards \u2013 that is, the majority of shareholders and directors \u2013 comply with new laws? Or would they join the trend to take companies private, away from the prying eyes of the public and the most stringent government rules?</p> <p>May has made provision for private companies to publish pay data, but this is voluntary. The temptation would be to have a mandatory rule that encompasses all forms of ownership, whether public or private. It is a temptation that ministers should embrace.</p> <h2>Chilly reality awaits retailers after basking in Christmas glow</h2> <p>Creditors usually wait for the Christmas spending spree to end before pulling the plug on struggling retailers and there is no reason to imagine that early 2018 will deviate from the normal pattern. It would be a miracle if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/21/playing-with-fire-last-minute-deal-saves-toys-r-us-from-collapse\" title=\"\">Toys R Us, rescued last week</a>, were to be the only company having financial difficulties at this time of year.</p> <p>After a surprisingly strong end to 2016, retailers have found life a lot tougher in 2017. Firstly, consumer spending has been subject to a nasty squeeze on real incomes, with prices rising faster than wages. The cannier households realised in the months following the EU referendum that the fall in the value of the pound would push up the cost of imports and brought forward purchases of big-ticket items. That helps explain why business was so brisk in the second half of 2016 and has been weak ever since. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/05/uk-car-sales-fall-diesel-smmt\" title=\"\">New car sales have been particularly soft.</a></p> <p>Secondly, retailers have seen their profits squeezed by an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage and by higher pension costs. They have sought to pass on higher costs to consumers, but this has not been all that easy when household budgets are under pressure.</p> <p>All this has come at a time when retailing is going through a profound change. Consumers know that they can save time and money by shopping online, and this has come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores.</p> <p>Life will get a bit easier in 2018, but not by all that much. The main effects of the pound\u2019s depreciation after the Brexit vote have now passed through the economy, so the annual inflation rate will come down from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/12/uk-inflation-rises-uk-cost-of-living-squeeze\" title=\"\">current level of 3.1%</a> over the coming months. Average earnings growth, currently running at an annual 2.3%, could also edge up a bit, boosting spending power. But the impact won\u2019t be dramatic.</p> <p>The economy has been over-reliant on consumer spending as the engine of growth, so some rebalancing towards investment and production is actually quite healthy. Retailers are unlikely to see it that way, though.</p> <h2>Apple\u2019s admission on batteries drains its users\u2019 goodwill</h2> <p>Apple claimed last week that it had had its customers\u2019 concerns at heart when it admitted what many users already suspected: the tech giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/apple-admits-slowing-older-iphones-because-of-flagging-batteries\" title=\"\">deliberately slows down older phones when their batteries start to struggle</a>.</p> <p>An Apple spokesperson said: \u201cOur goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices.\u201d But they are no fools at Cupertino and they must have known what would come next: a lawsuit from disgruntled customers.</p> <p>Apple now has a public relations problem on its hands. Trust is an ever-relevant issue in the tech sector, from issues of privacy to the vulnerability of your online life to hackers.</p> <p>Apple has added to those concerns unnecessarily. It is unlikely that the battery story will have a material impact on sales, but it will make it harder to win back the public if the company encounters more serious problems in the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a tradition of stock markets that December usually sees a Santa rally. This year, though, we\u2019ve had a tax rally, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s business-friendly fiscal reforms, which finally made their tortuous way through the US legislative process. With just a few days left until the end of the year, US and UK markets are close to their record highs, with the FTSE 100 hitting a new peak a couple of days ago. Despite this belated achievement, the UK index has lagged others throughout the year, and even though European markets have fallen back recently on political concerns \u2013 German uncertainty and the latest Catalan election result \u2013 they have still outpaced UK shares thanks to Brexit worries and a recovering pound. But there is still a week to go and although the FTSE 100 is unlikely to make up lost ground on Europe and the US, it could still push to new peaks, as could Wall Street. A dearth of news is likely to make for some lacklustre volumes, but consequently could lead to volatility. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, summed it up: \u201c[The week ahead] promises to be a quiet one, as the corporate calendar dries up and the economic schedule is quite bereft. Now tax reform is out of the way, the last question for the year is, will the Dow hit 25,000? At present, it seems unwilling to move higher, but given the light volumes of next week there is still a chance to pull one more rabbit from the hat.\u201d Chilly reality awaits retailers after basking in Christmas glow Today is the final shopping day before Christmas and high street retailers will be hoping that consumers are out in force looking for last-minute gifts. And that they\u2019ll come back on Boxing Day for the sales. Shopkeepers continue to face severe difficulties, with growing competition from online businesses and a squeeze on household finances, as well as hefty rate bills. Christmas used to be the key time of the year, but these days retailers fear that the Black Friday event cannibalises festive sales, with customers picking up bargains in November rather than paying full price in December. Indeed, according to a CBI report last week, sales in the run-up to Christmas rose by less than expected. Even the hoped-for boost on Boxing Day may be curtailed by people ordering goods online as soon as the Christmas turkey is eaten. So look out this coming week for any retail profit warnings, with companies obliged to update the stock market as soon as they know they will not meet City expectations. Last year saw a warning from Next about its poor Christmas performance that sent the whole sector into a tailspin, while previous years had seen the likes of Game Digital, Sports Direct and Debenhams report worse-than-expected seasonal sales. As it happens, Next was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Friday: so perhaps we should expect good news this time. Pre-new-year is the time for the annual meeting Anyone looking for a bit of entertainment in the post-Christmas and pre-new-year lull might be spoiled for choice \u2013 at least if they are shareholders in a clutch of companies that have chosen one of the quietest weeks of the year to hold their annual meetings. In London? Then Sirius Petroleum is the one for you. The company recently raised $9m to start drilling at a well in Nigeria, and Wednesday is the day when investors can catch up with all the gripping details. The same day in Reading, IT group cloudBuy is asking investors to approve a \u00a33.4m cash injection from one of its main shareholders, Roberto Sella. It says that, despite a recent cost-cutting programme, it needs some form of additional funding to avoid the prospect of insolvency, so it may be worth shareholders making the effort. The following two days see, firstly, drug development group Evgen Pharma asking investors to turn up in Wilmslow, and then, on Friday, Andalas Energy and Power expecting people to trek to the Isle of Man to quiz directors. Both companies are also asking for approval of fundraising. Still, with luck, there may be some refreshment at the meetings. It\u2019s the least the companies could do to justify the unsociable timing of their gatherings. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not just leftover turkey sandwiches and unwanted mince pies.",
