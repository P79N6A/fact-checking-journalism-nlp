Centrica's share price is up by more than half at 367p. SSE stood at \u00a310.60 in early 2009 and closed at \u00a314.74 on Monday. Then there are the ever-rising dividends.

Photograph: REMO CASILLI/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's some good political analysis around this morning about Italy.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/italy-plunges-into-fresh-political.html\">The Open Europe thinktank first</a>.</strong> It explains that there are two scenarios now that Silvio Berlusconi has withdrawn his ministers from Enrico Letta's government. Either Letta wins Wednesday's confidence vote, or he loses it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both are plausible. And curiously, while a defeat wouldn't trigger an immediate general election, a victory wouldn't cement Letta's authority.</p> <h2><em><strong>Scenario 1 - Letta survives the confidence vote in the Senate</strong></em></h2> <p>Tough, but definitely not unrealistic. Letta needs around 20 Senators from either Berlusconi's party or Beppe Grillo's Five-Star Movement to break ranks and support him. Over the past few days,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2013-09-29/senato-occhi-puntati-085459.shtml?uuid=AbF71QfI\">politicians from both parties</a>&#xa0;have hinted at the possibility of defections. Crucially, after tendering their resignations, four of Berlusconi's ministers have expressed reservations over their leader's decision to open a new political crisis at this stage. All this suggests Letta does have a chance&#xa0;of winning the vote in the Italian Senate, and staying in power with a different, albeit thinner, parliamentary majority (and after a rather substantial cabinet reshuffle).</p> <p>However, this would only be a temporary fix. With his new majority, Letta could try and address a couple of urgent issues (a reform of Italy's tortuous electoral law and the budget for 2014 are the most obvious) - and perhaps plan for early elections at some point next year.</p> <h2><em><strong>Scenario 2 - Letta loses the confidence vote</strong></em></h2> <p>If Letta loses the confidence vote, he will have to resign. As we explained several times, the ball would then be in Italian President Giorgio Napolitano's court. Napolitano would have to hold talks with all the political parties and then make a decision: task Letta himself or someone else with forming a new government, or dissolve parliament and call new elections.</p> <p>New elections in Italy can take place&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Article/Page/en/LIVE?id=9986&amp;page=FlashAnalysis\">no less than 45 days after parliament is dissolved</a>.&#xa0;The risks of a quick return to the polls are obvious. Voting again with the same electoral law may well lead to another inconclusive outcome - meaning that Italy could be facing a few months of political paralysis at a time when the country can least afford it. As if things were not complicated enough, the electoral law is currently being examined by the Italian Constitutional Court, with a ruling expected in early December - and is at risk of being declared at least in part unconstitutional.</p> <p>This is where we are at. Clearly, none of the two scenarios would provide the medium-term political stability Italy needs to get its act together - which in itself is not great news for both the country and the eurozone as a whole. Everything will depend on how Wednesday's vote of confidence goes.&#xa0;</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52494b2de4b0f2e0c7543857\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-30T10:04:36.231Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the economic front,<strong> eurozone inflation has fallen</strong> to its lowest level in three and a half years.</p> <p>The consumer price index slid to just 1.1% in August, despite the European Central Bank keeping interest rates at record lows of just 0.5%.

Until then, goodnight, and thanks GW Quick peek at Wall Street - the Dow Jones is still down, but only off 82 points at 15176. That's a drop of around 0.5%. Looks like traders are sitting on their hands as the Shutdown Showdown plays out, rather than waving them in the air in a panicky fashion. Hot off the Reuters terminal; more details of Silvio Berlusconi's showdown meeting with his party tonight. A senior lawmaker from Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party said on Monday he was not satisfied after a party meeting at which Berlusconi sought to quell internal dissent with his decision to pull PDL's ministers from the government. Up to 20 PDL Senators may be willing to defy Berlusconi and support Prime Minister Enrico Letta in a confidence vote on Wednesday, a PDL source told Reuters earlier on Monday. \"The situation has not been clarified,\" the PDL's former lower house leader Fabrizio Cicchitto told reporters after the meeting. Cicchitto, one of the first PDL officials to express dissent with Berlusconi's decision on Saturday, said Berlusconi had left no room for debate after he had addressed the meeting and it was necessary to open a proper discussion in the party. A photo of a grim-faced Silvio Berlusconi arriving at the Italian parliament to meet with his party (and urge them to stick together) just landed: Time for a summary of the main events of the day: \u2022 America's government is on the brink of shutting down, but a last-gasp deal can't be ruled out. Politicians in Washington are making a final attempt to agree a new short-term budget deal before midnight tonight. The deadlock comes a Republicans try to force President Obama to accept delays and cuts to his landmark Affordable Healthcare act. Details here My US colleagues will be covering the action over the next 12 hours here: US government shutdown looms as Congress fights over spending bill \u2013 live \u2022 Italy remains locked in a political crisis tonight. Prime minister Enrico Letta is due to address the Italian parliament on Wednesday, and seek a confidence vote to discover whether he still has support to govern. Analysts believe he could win the vote, but still be left struggling for authority. \u2022 Tonight, Silvio Berlusconi has urged his party to stick together, amid reports that a group of senators are defying their leader -- concerned that he is trying to bring Letta down. \u2022 European stock markets fell sharply this morning on fears over Italy's political crisis. The US shutdown also dominated the day, meaning the main indices all closed in the red. Here's the closing prices. \u2022 Italy's borrowing costs spiked in early trading, but recovered somewhat this afternoon. It's 10-year bonds just closed, with yields up 15 basis points at 4.57%. \u2022 The US dollar was hit by events in Washington, pushing the pound over $1.62 for the first time since January. \u2022 In Greece, the deputy prime minister has ruled out an early general election. Evangelos Venizelos made the pledge after a dramatic weekend in which many top officials in the neo Nazi Golden Dawn party were detained. \u2022 While in the UK, chancellor George Osborne pledge to deliver a budget surplus in the next parliament. Full story here. Developments in Italy tonight, where Silvio Berlusconi has met with his PDL party -- and appears to be softening his hard-line approach. Italian centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi told his People of Freedom lawmakers that they must stick together after some party officials expressed dissent at his decision to withdraw the group's ministers from Prime Minister Enrico Letta's government. \"We must remain united,\" Berlusconi said, according to a parliamentarian present at the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added he was willing to conditionally support the 2014 budget to be presented next month and other tax measures, but Italy should then hold a new election. 30-Sep-2013 17:49SENIOR PDL LAWMAKER SAYS AFTER PDL PARLIAMENTARIANS MEET BERLUSCONI THAT SITUATION IS STILL UNCLEAR, FURTHER MEETING NEEDED 30-Sep-2013 16:57 - BERLUSCONI TOLD PDL LAWMAKERS HE TOOK DECISION TO PULL MINISTERS FROM GOVERNMENT ALONE, THERE WAS NO SENSE IN REMAINING IN GOVERNMENT-SOURCE AT MEETING Certainly looks like Berlusconi might be backing away from bringing Enrico Letta's government crashing down. Another angle on the US shutdown: (reminder: our American liveblog is here) Consumer giant Unilever slipped out a trading update after trading on the London stock market closed, in which it admits that growth in emerging markets has stuttered by more than expected. In a brief statement, it explained that will tell investors this week that it is \"on track to meet its 2013 priorities\", despite \"slower market growth\" in many emerging countries. Here's the key message: Unilever will say that it has seen weakening in the market growth of many emerging countries in quarter three and now expects underlying sales growth of 3 to 3.5% in the quarter. The emerging market slow-down has accelerated as a result of significant currency weakening. Developed markets remain flat to down. That compares with underlying sales growth of 5% in the previous three months. A slowdown indeed. Europe's stock markets are closed, with losses across the board. However, the shares did recover some ground from this morning's early tumble, reflecting speculation that Silvio Berlusconi may have overplayed his hand by hauling his ministers out of the Italian government. Closing prices: \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 211 points at 17,434, -1.2% \u2022 FTSE 100: down 50 points at 6462, = 0.5% \u2022 German DAX: down 67 points at 8, 594, -0.77% \u2022 French CAC: down 43 points at 4,143, -1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 42 points at 9,186, -0.46% Reaction to follow Government shutdowns can have unintended consequences: The Starr report into the affair appears to stand this up. Heads-up, the pound just hit $1.62 $1.6197 against the US dollar, its highest level since the start of the year. While 10-year US bonds prices are slightly weaker today, the price of five-year Treasury bills has actually risen a small amount today. Back in the eurozone, then. And buried in the market action is a small rally in Greek bonds today. Bond traders seem to be welcoming the long-hoped-for clampdown on Golden Dawn, and the pledge from the Greek deputy prime minister that a new general election won't be triggered. This has pushed Greek bond prices up, lowering the yield on its 10-year debt by 15 basis points to 9.41%, down from 9.56%. on Friday night. My colleagues in America have launched a new liveblog, covering every twist and turn as America ploughs towards a government shutdown at midnight tonight (or 5am BST tomorrow) It explains how politicians in Washington could pull a deal out of the fire: The Senate meets at 2pm to strip the Obamacare delay out of the spending bill and pass it \"clean.\" That is expected to happen fairly quickly, according to congressional staffers Dan's been speaking with. Then the bill goes back to the House, which will be waiting to put health care measures back in, including the so-called Vitter amendment which would require members of Congress personally to receive Obamacare. The legislation thus laden should then likely have time to bounce back to the Senate, where it would be indignantly ignored. Tom McCarthy is at the controls: US government shutdown looms as Congress fights over spending bill \u2013 live Here's Reuters early stock market report from the floor of Wall Street: U.S. stocks fell sharply on Monday as a last-minute deal to resolve a budget impasse in Washington appeared less likely, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown. Losses were broad, with all ten S&amp;P 500 sectors lower on the day, led by energy and financials shares. About 80% of companies traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq fell. The House of Representatives early on Sunday voted for an emergency spending bill that includes a one-year delay of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare overhaul despite threats of a veto from the White House. A shutdown would have wide-ranging implications for a most types of assets. If a deal is reached quickly, markets might recover, but a prolonged shutdown could do significant harm to the economy and consumer confidence. While a deal could still be reached before the government's fiscal year ends at midnight on Monday, such a possibility was considered unlikely. Up to 1 million government employees could be furloughed by the absence of a deal, and if the shutdown takes place, the Labor Department will postpone issuing its closely watched monthly employment report scheduled for Friday. \"The government is such an important part of the entire economy, between the people it employs and the impact it has on consumer confidence,\" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. \"The size of the selloff is logical given the stakes.\" There's absolutely no chance that the US will default on its debts next month, argues Rick Rieder of BlackRock, the group's co-head of fixed investment in the Americas. He's certain that politicians will agree a deal to raise the debt ceiling before October 17, when funds run out, even if the US Federal government shuts down at midnight tonight. Speaking on Bloomberg TV's snappily-named \"Shutdown Showdown\", Rieder predicted a repeat of the events of 2011, when a deal was reached at the last minute. Reider added: I definitely have a sense that they won' t push it over the edge. Worth noting that there's no significant move in the price of US Treasuries today (yet anyway). Despite the imminent danger that hundreds of thousands of Federal government workers are about to take an unscheduled, unpaid break, US government bonds are changing hands for virtually the same price as last Friday. The 10-year Treasury Bill has dropped very slightly in value, pushing up its bond yield by just 0.02 percentage points to 2.63%, up from 2.61%. Italian government bonds are recovering on the back of the rumours that 20 Italian senators are threatening to break away from Silvio Berlusconi's party, and potentially support prime minister Enrico Letta. Italy's debt is still down on the day, pushing up its 10-year bond yields by 15 basis points at 4.58%. But that's rather lower than the peak this morning -- showing less panic over the situation in Rome. Like the Dow Jones index on Wall Street, European stock markets also remain in the red. They are being pulled lower by a mixture of US shutdown fears and Italian political chaos. Those reports of a revolt against Silvio Berlusconi by his own senators (see 2.29pm) have eased worries, a little bit: \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 296 points at 17350, -1.67% \u2022 FTSE 100: down 51 points at 6461, -0.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 96 points at 8565, -1.1% \u2022 French CAC: down 57 points at 4129, -1.3% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 88 points at 9140, -0.95% A last-minute compromise in America to avoid a government shutdown isn't impossible, but it's not looking likely, as CBNC explains: One thing we know for sure about today: The Senate will reconvene this afternoon and kill the bill passed by the House over the weekend to fund the government in return for a one-year delay in the president's health care bill along with other provisions Democrats will never accept. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the Senate Democratic majority will then send a clean government funding bill back to the House where Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, will have just a few hours to figure out how to respond. If no deal is reached, the federal government will begin closing down non-essential operations and send hundreds of thousands of workers home. And the big question swirling around Washington, Wall Street, and beyond is clear -- how will a shutdown hurt attempts to raise the US debt ceiling before October 17, when the US could default. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, explains that traders are furiously trying to calculate the impact of a US government shutdown. It's clearly not great news for the economy, thus the drop on the Dow this morning. One side-effect of a shutdown is that the monthly US jobs report might not be released on Friday. Without a Non-Farm Payroll reading, it will be harder for the Federal Reserve to judge whether to slow its monetary stimulus programme. He writes: At a time when economic growth is fragile at best, the market is now working out the implications of what the economic impact could be on Q4 growth. Not always easy to measure something like this as talks between lawmakers continues but what is fast accepted in the market is that tapering by the Fed may be held off for this year. Fed head Bernanke will not fire the tapering trigger until the fiscal situation is under control which could take longer than he and the markets had anticipated. Every stock on the Dow Jones is in the red this morning. The biggest fallers are Goldman Sachs (down 1.9%), Boeing (-1.6%) and Nike (down 1.5%). The Dow itself has settled down around 160 points lower at 15100, -1%. Looks like a nice day in Washington for a last-ditch attempt to avoid non-essential government services being shut down: That's a bigger drop on the Dow Jones than expected (although the Dow takes around 15 minutes to fully open). Wall Street is open, and shares are sliding. The Dow Jones industrial average has slid 170 points in the early moments of trading, as traders dash to offload shares in the face of a US government shutdown. That's a drop of 1.1%, to 15087. Similar tale on the tech stock-heavy Nasdaq, down over 1%. Details to follow Back to Italy, where there are reports of a revolt against Silvio Berlusconi from some of his own senators over his decision to effectively declare war on prime minister Enrico Letta over the weekend. Reuters is reporting that up to 20 of Berlusconi's centre-right group are threatening to form a breakaway faction in the Senate. Here's the story: As many as 20 senators from the centre-right party of Silvio Berlusconi are ready to form a breakaway group unless the former premier backs down on his hard line to bring down Italy's government and head to elections, a top member of the party told Reuters on Monday. The threat, which lawmakers from the People of Freedom Party (PDL) are going to level at Berlusconi during a meeting on Monday, may give Prime Minister Enrico Letta a chance to save his government after five PDL ministers resigned on Saturday. Letta is going before parliament for a confidence vote on Wednesday and needs to secure a majority in the Senate - where the PDL is currently the second-largest party -- in order to continue in government. Republican speaker John Boehner is one of the key players in today's last-ditch struggle to avoid the US government shutting town, National Review's Washington editor Robert Costa reports that he grabbed a few words with Boehner at Pete's Diner. Boehner has been criticised for failing to keep the Republican wing of Congress under control -- guests on Bloomberg TV early this morning chastised Boehner for not handling the Tea Party element better. Tensions rising in Italy too -- the head of the banking association says he's worried about government stability, and fears \"serious damage\" to Italy. And the head of the country's UIL union has warned that Italy could find itself run by the Troika unless it has a stable administration. Thirdly, ratings agency Fitch has warned that it could downgrade Italy if the country's government does fall, as its \"short and medium-term fiscal policy targets\" would be at risk. That may not capture the full importance of Wednesday's government confidence vote Are Western countries lurching into an autumn of disorder? Leading economist Nouriel Roubini is certainly worried, citing five separate factors: \u2022 the risk of the US government shutting down. There's less than a day to go to hammer out a deal, and economists fear that a shutdown could scupper the recovery \u2022 Italy's fragile government which faces a confidence vote on Wednesday, after Silvio Berlusconi order his ministers to quit the cabinet \u2022 the crackdown on neoNazis in Greece, which could provoke political instability \u2022 the Portuguese goverment's drubbing in local elections yesterday, and \u2022 the slow progress on forming a new German government (a deal could be weeks away) There's a certain degree of cynicism over the antics in Washington: There's still hope, though, that a US government shutdown can be averted in time. For that to happen, the Republican-controlled Congress would have to vote through a new funding framework for October onwards that is acceptable to the Democrat-controlled Senate. Before midnight. Republican senator John Thune of South Dakota reckons there's still time for compromise. He told Bloomberg that he's \"still hopeful\" that shutdown can be avoided, if \"the Congress could send something back that can be approved by the Senate\". As explained earlier, Congress did pass a budget over the weekend, but it included cuts and delays to the President Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act that aren't acceptable to the Democrats. It's almost quarter past eight in the morning on the East Coast of the US, which means less than 16 hours until the Federal government will shut down unless a budget for 2013-2014 is approved. Bloomberg's Washington reporter Peter Cook reports that security officers on Capitol Hill say they expect that the shutdown will take place, adding: Everyone is betting on a shutdown at midnight. And political analyst Matt Dowd explains that \"a huge section of the Republican party\" wants to shut the government down, which makes a last-ditch deal less likely. Philosophically they think shutting down the government is a good thing. Sounds like they might get their wish.... I've pulled together a short explainer of how the American government has been dragged to the brink of shutdown, for readers outside the US: US shutdown: an explainer for non-Americans Over in Greece deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos has just given a press conference in which he ruled out the country going to early elections, following the crackdown on the far-right Golden Dawn party. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith reports. Evangelos Venizelos said the arrests of \u201ca large number \u201dof Golden Dawn's MPs would not be the spur for fresh elections. Athens\u2019 two-party coalition \u201cwill exhaust its four year term with the goal of creating a programme that will given prospect and hope to the Greek people,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe country, right now, has immediate goals,\u201d he said insisting that it was imperative the government focus on ongoing negotiations with Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of foreign lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF. \u201cThe last thing this place needs is political upheaval. Can you see what is happening in Italy?\u201d he asked adding that financial markets were already reacting badly to developments there \u201cand Italy\u2019s the eighth-largest economy in the world.\u201d But the politician, who is also foreign minister, acknowledged that the neo-nazi party had become \u201cas big a topic as the economic crisis\u201d afflicting Greece in his discussions with foreign leaders in New York where he attended the UN\u2019s general assembly last week. Mission heads representing the troika are expected to return to Athens immediately after the next Euro group meeting of euro zone finance ministers on October 14 to close discussions on a third rescue programme for the debt-stricken country. Meanwhile, in the wake of the arrest of Golden Dawn MPs and others, inquires are continuing apace with authorities this morning reportedly unearthing \u201ca heap\u201d of Nazi paraphernalia in the home of Christos Pappas, the party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman accused of being the second-in-command of the criminal gang the extremists also allegedly ran. Oh, and chancellor Osborne also pledged to freeze fuel duty until 2015 -- so long as the coalition can find the money (ie, if the Liberal Democrats agree). A couple of interesting lines from George Osborne's Tory conference speech (live blog here). The Italian political crisis, and the looming threat of the US government shutdown, is proof that \"the debt crisis isn't over\". Osborne cited an old favourite, the Greek slump. \"Ask people in Greece what happens when economies fail.\" And he also pledged that a future Conservative government would plan to run a budget surplus in future years, during the 'good times'. Still some work to do, though, with Britain running a deficit of more than one hundred billion pounds this year. Back in the financial markets, Italian government debt is still down today, but has recovered partly from its early selloff. The yield (effectively the interest rate) on 10-year Italian bonds is currently 4.65%, from 4.42% on Friday, reflecting a drop in the value of the bonds this morning. In comparison, Spanish 10-year yields are 4.38% -- Rome has replaced Madrid as the bigger risk to eurozone stability. Still well below the 7% level where a country has lost the power to fund itself. Italian debt is still protected by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy unlimited quantities of its bonds if needed. However.... that ECB promise required a country to sign up for 'conditionality' in return -- such as economic reforms and fiscal targets. Could Rome really promise that, given the political instability? And could the ECB believe it? Up in Manchester, chancellor George Osborne is about to give a speech on the UK economy at the Conservative Party conference. There's live coverage in Andrew Sparrow's live blog: Conservative conference - George Osborne's 'work for benefits' speech: Politics live blog Bloomberg's Europe editor, David Tweed, has been canvassing Italian politicians. Some are confidently predicting that Enrico Letta will win Wednesday's confidence vote (where the real challenge is in the Senate, where Letta's PD party doesn't have a guaranteed majority). Here's the details, with a video embedded in the third tweet: Another of our go-to guys on Italian politics, Alberto Nardelli, agrees that another Italian general election couldn't be held until the end of November. He also flags up some key points, including that the radical Five Star Movement is enjoying a revival in the polls. Here's a flavour: Additional factors to keep an eye on: - the M5S after a post-election drop, is once again above 20% in polls. - the Democratic Party (PD) is holding leadership primaries in December. These are for the party secretary, a role that will be split from the PM-candidate role. If the situation unravels, expect an argument on who would run as PM-candidate, especially if elections take place before December. - within Berlusconi\u2019s PDL there is a clearly divided on direction to take - several senior figures have voiced concerns over the decision to pull the plug on the government. The party is internally arguing and fighting over its future - splits are possible. - an election without a change in the voting law is likely to lead to the same deadlock we have now. There's some good political analysis around this morning about Italy. The Open Europe thinktank first. It explains that there are two scenarios now that Silvio Berlusconi has withdrawn his ministers from Enrico Letta's government. Either Letta wins Wednesday's confidence vote, or he loses it. Both are plausible. And curiously, while a defeat wouldn't trigger an immediate general election, a victory wouldn't cement Letta's authority. Scenario 1 - Letta survives the confidence vote in the Senate Tough, but definitely not unrealistic. Letta needs around 20 Senators from either Berlusconi's party or Beppe Grillo's Five-Star Movement to break ranks and support him. Over the past few days, politicians from both parties have hinted at the possibility of defections. Crucially, after tendering their resignations, four of Berlusconi's ministers have expressed reservations over their leader's decision to open a new political crisis at this stage. All this suggests Letta does have a chance of winning the vote in the Italian Senate, and staying in power with a different, albeit thinner, parliamentary majority (and after a rather substantial cabinet reshuffle). However, this would only be a temporary fix. With his new majority, Letta could try and address a couple of urgent issues (a reform of Italy's tortuous electoral law and the budget for 2014 are the most obvious) - and perhaps plan for early elections at some point next year. Scenario 2 - Letta loses the confidence vote If Letta loses the confidence vote, he will have to resign. As we explained several times, the ball would then be in Italian President Giorgio Napolitano's court. Napolitano would have to hold talks with all the political parties and then make a decision: task Letta himself or someone else with forming a new government, or dissolve parliament and call new elections. New elections in Italy can take place no less than 45 days after parliament is dissolved. The risks of a quick return to the polls are obvious. Voting again with the same electoral law may well lead to another inconclusive outcome - meaning that Italy could be facing a few months of political paralysis at a time when the country can least afford it. As if things were not complicated enough, the electoral law is currently being examined by the Italian Constitutional Court, with a ruling expected in early December - and is at risk of being declared at least in part unconstitutional. This is where we are at. Clearly, none of the two scenarios would provide the medium-term political stability Italy needs to get its act together - which in itself is not great news for both the country and the eurozone as a whole. Everything will depend on how Wednesday's vote of confidence goes. On the economic front, eurozone inflation has fallen to its lowest level in three and a half years. The consumer price index slid to just 1.1% in August, despite the European Central Bank keeping interest rates at record lows of just 0.5%. That looks like a clear signal that the ECB could ease monetary policy further without risking price stability. The overall inflation rate is being driven down by falling prices in some of the countries gripped by austerity, notable Greece which has been experiencing deflation in recent months. The ECB's governing council will meet this week to discuss policy -- with a decision and press conference due on Wednesday (a day earlier than usual). The same day as the Italian parliament will hold a vote of confidence in Enrico Letta's government.... Reports from Italy that Silvio Berlusconi will hold fresh talks with his party (People of Liberty, being rebranded as Forza Italia) at 5pm local time, or 4pm BST: The revival in Britain's housing market continues, with mortgage approvals hitting their highest level since February 2008. A total of 62,226 mortgages were signed in August, up from 60,900 in July, the Bank of England reported. That's even before the UK government brought forward the second stage of its Help to Buy scheme - in which taxpayers will guarantee a slice of a mortgage. If mortgage approvals are so healthy, why the need to rush forwards Help to Buy?.... Looking back at America.... unless there's a last-minute breakthrough it appears that the US government will shut down tonight. As things stand, the Congress (controlled by Republicans) is unlikely to pass a budget for 2014 that will not include cuts to President Obama's health reforms. It's equally implausible that such a budget could get through the Senate (controlled by Democrats), or be approved by the White House. If that happens, non-essential government staff would be forced to take unpaid holiday - for the first time in 17 years. A shutdown could have serious consequences for the US economy, as Jane Foley of Rabobank explains: The costs of a government shutdown clearly depend on its duration. Moody\u2019s estimate that a 3 to 4 week closure of government would knock 1.4% of GDP growth in Q3 and that a 2 week closure would slice away 0.3%. The row is particularly serious as the US government is also close to hitting its debt ceiling - under American law it's only allowed to owe $16.7 trillion (say it fast and it doesn't sound as much). Washington needs to reach a deal on the debt ceiling soon, probably before 17 October when US borrowing is expected to hit the legal limit. Breach that, and America could default. It's just 4.35am in New York but, as Business Insider reports, Wall Street is expected to join in the selloff when trading begins later today. We might have expected a bigger market reaction to the prospect of the Italian government imploding. I mean, a 2% drop on the Milan stock market is serious, but not actually deadly. Likewise, Italian borrowing costs have jumped, but are still below the 5% mark -- let alone the 7% 'danger zone'. The reason, I think, it's not clear who will be the big loser by the end of this week \u2013 prime minister Enrico Letta, or Silvio Belusconi. As my colleague Lizzy Davies explained last night, Silvio Berlusconi faces growing dissent from his own party members over his decision to order his ministers to withdraw from Enrico Letta's administration. Lizzy writes that four of these ministers have now criticised the move: The most stinging blow came from Angelino Alfano, Berlusconi's right-hand man, who has been acting as deputy PM and interior minister in the Letta coalition. He said that if Forza Italia were to be dominated by extreme positions, he would have to be \"a Berlusconi-ite in a different way\". The unprecedented dissent from within his own party appeared to prompt the three-times prime minister to tone down his high-stakes strategy, which earlier in the day saw him triumphantly declare that he was \"ready to take up the battle again\". Silvio Berlusconi faces rebellion from allies after chaotic weekend In other election news, Portugal's government was pummeled in local elections yesterday, as anger over the country's austerity programme hit its support. The Social Democrats won just 17% of the vote, while the opposition Socialists scooped 36%. The hammering comes just two weeks before the government delivers its proposed 2014 budget, which will include another round of spending cuts. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Austria's centrist coalition government struggled to victory in its general election last night, despite a rise in support for eurosceptic and far-right candidates. Both the Social Democrats and the Conservatives attracted a smaller share of the vote than last time, but appear to have enough votes to keep governing. The Freedom Party of Austria, which ran on an anti-immigration and anti-Islam ticket, won 21.4% of the vote. And a new eurosceptic parties founded by Austrian-Canadian businessman Frank Stronach won enough votes to enter parliament. Team Stronach attracted around 5.8% of votes, around one percent more than the Alternative For Germany managed in last weekend's German elections. More here: Austria's centrist coalition survives far-right election gains The cost of a barrel of US crude oil is also down by around $1, to $101.77. It is being hit by fears that the US economy will stumble if Washington shuts down. Just two shares are up on the Italian stock market this morning, while many are down over 4%. Here's the details of the risers and fallers: Several shares have been halted on the Italian stock market, after falling so sharply that they triggered an automatic suspension. The list includes several financial stocks - including Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy's largest retail bank) , as fastFT's Megan Murphy flags up: Shares in Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset group were among the fallers, dropping as much as 5% in early trading: European stock markets fell sharply in early trading as the prospect of the US government shutting down and the Italian coalition collapsing this week (see 8.07am) sends shivers through trading floors. The Milan stock market is a sea of red. This has sent the FTSE MIB index tumbling by 2.2% in a wave of early selling -- matching the spike in Italian borrowing costs (see 7.31am) In London, the FTSE 100 fell sharply and is down 55 points, with most share losing ground. That's a drop of almost 1%, to 6459. (details to follow) It's a sea of red in other markets too. The Spanish IBEX is down by almost 2%, reflecting fears that Silvio Berlusconi's decision to order his ministers to quit the coalition could throw fuel on the eurozone debt crisis. As Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explained: Italy risks being the source of latest fireworks with Prime Minister Letta confirming he is seeking a vote of confidence after Berlusconi (who may be ejected from Senate due to tax-fraud) ordered (yes, he\u2019s still running the show) the withdrawal of 5 cabinet members from his party\u2019s wing within the young coalition and emphasised its fragility. VAT is the issue within next year\u2019s budget. The deadlock in Washington hardened over the weekend after Congress passed a law to keep the US funded until December, in return for a one-year delay to the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Barack Obama's flagship policy. Both Senate Democrats and the White House are refusing to accept this. Here's today's story: US government on verge of shutdown as House votes to delay health law Italian government bonds are sliding in value today, driving up its borrowing costs. Investors are dashing to offload them ahead of Wednesday's crucial confidence vote that could bring down prime minister Enrico Letta. In early trading, the yield (or interest rate) on Italian 10-year debt has spiked to 4.74%, from as low as 4.42% on Friday evening (that's TradeWeb's data, off the Reuters terminal). The political tensions in America and Italy hit stock markets across Asia, with heavy losses from Japan to India. The Japanese Nikkei closed a little while ago, down over 2%. \u2022 Nikkei: closed down 204 points at 14,455, - 2.06% \u2022 Hong Kong Hang Seng: down 299 points at 22,907, -1.3% \u2022 India's Sensex: currently down 247 points at 19,479, -1.26% Traders expected falls in Europe. Here's IG's early calls: The FTSE at 6451 -61, DAX 8612 -49, CAC 4162 -24, IBEX 9154 -74 and MIB 17354 -292 The other dramatic development over the weekend was the Greek government cracking down on the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party. Sixteen party activists, including its leader Nikos Michaloliakos, were detained in a series of early-morning raids on Saturday. Yesterday, the party's spokesman surrendered, after 24 hours on the run. As Helena Smith reported from Athens: A Greek MP said to be the second in command of the far-right Golden Dawn party has surrendered after authorities arrested the organisation's leader and other key members on charges of running a criminal gang. Christos Pappas, the party's parliamentary spokesman and unrepentant holder of many of its most hardline views, handed himself over to police more than 24 hours after an unprecedented crackdown on the neo-fascist group began. Appearing at Athens's central police headquarters in a taxi, the politician insisted the vehemently anti-immigrant party would \"survive \u2026 the political persecution\" it was being subjected to. Golden Dawn MP Christos Pappas surrenders to Greek police The arrests have been hailed as a long-awaited move against the party. But it also raises the prospect of political instability in Greece, should Golden Dawn's MPs resign and trigger a series of by-elections. The Greek coalition government only has a slender majority. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Political instability is building on both sides of the Atlantic, sending shivers through the financial world as investors contemplate an autumn of drama and turbulence. Asian stock markets have already posted heavy losses, with the Japanese Nikkei sliding 1.8%. European markets are likely to drop by at least 1% when trading begins. As Chris Weston, IG's man in Melbourne, put it: The news flow has turned decisively negative in the last few days. In America, the government is on the verge of shutting down, with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree a new spending bill. If a deal can't be struck by midnight tonight then Washington should shutdown, leaving federal workers unpaid and leaving government in limbo. Republicans continue to insist on making swingeing cuts to Obamacare, the president's healthcare policies, in return for approving the budget. Barack Obama refuses to accept such a plan. While in Italy, prime minister Enrico Letta is battling to hold his government together. On Saturday, disgraced former-PM Silvio Berlusconi ordered ministers from his party to withdraw from Letta's shaky coalition. They did so, triggering a new political crisis in Rome. Letta has now called a confidence vote on Wednesday, that will show whether he can continue to govern. Should he fall, Italy could be dragged back into the eurozone crisis. It's going to be a dramatic week....",

      "bodyText": "It's not over. The job is only half done. There's hard graft ahead. Dealing with debt addiction will take time. That was the message from George Osborne as he offered voters what he called \"a serious plan for a grown-up country\". The chancellor's speech to the Conservative party conference was both a statement of the obvious and a piece of political positioning. It has taken far, far longer than the Treasury expected for growth to return to the economy, but, fortunately for Osborne, voters still blame the last Labour government rather than the current administration for the delay. When the chancellor said \"the battle to turn Britain around\" was not over, the subtext was that voters should think twice before putting Ed Miliband and Ed Balls in charge. In place of Labour's failure to \"mend the roof while the sun was shining,\" the next Conservative government would start to pay down the national debt by running a budget surplus during the course of the next parliament. This was making a virtue of necessity. The 2010 forecasts made when Osborne took over at the Treasury from Alistair Darling saw the economy growing at almost 3% in both 2012 and 2013, with deep cuts in the budget deficit as a result. The chancellor boasted on Monday that public borrowing had been cut by a third since the coalition came to power; what he did not say was that it is still expected to be \u00a3120bn this year \u2013 double what was envisaged in 2010. Osborne has already abandoned his original aim of sorting out the public finances in one parliament, with two extra years of deficit reduction pencilled in during the first two years after the 2015 election. on Monday, the chancellor went further, announcing that a Conservative government would run a budget surplus in the next parliament. This is some commitment. Capital spending on the UK's infrastructure will be \u00a325bn a year on existing plans and will rise in line with economic growth during the next parliament. The Treasury will need to squeeze current spending if it is to achieve an overall surplus. Is this possible? The ringfencing of spending on the NHS, schools and overseas development means that there have already been deep cuts in the budgets of other Whitehall departments. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain's leading thinktank on tax and spending matters, were already sceptical about whether spending on the police, the courts and other non-ringfenced activities could be cut much further even before Osborne's latest pledge. That's not to say it is impossible for a surplus to be run in the next parliament. It will, however, require two things: reductions in welfare spending and a prolonged period of steady growth.

      "body": "<p>It's not over. The job is only half done. There's hard graft ahead. Dealing with debt addiction will take time. That was the message from George Osborne as he offered voters what he called \"a serious plan for a grown-up country\".</p> <p>The chancellor's speech to the Conservative party conference was both a statement of the obvious and a piece of political positioning. It has taken far, far longer than the Treasury expected for growth to return to the economy, but, fortunately for Osborne, voters still blame the last Labour government rather than the current administration for the delay. When the chancellor said \"the battle to turn Britain around\" was not over, the subtext was that voters should think twice before putting Ed Miliband and Ed Balls in charge.</p> <p>In place of Labour's failure to \"mend the roof while the sun was shining,\" the next Conservative government would start to pay down the national debt by running a budget surplus during the course of the next parliament.</p> <p>This was making a virtue of necessity. The 2010 forecasts made when Osborne took over at the Treasury from Alistair Darling saw the economy growing at almost 3% in both 2012 and 2013, with deep cuts in the budget deficit as a result. The chancellor boasted on Monday that public borrowing had been cut by a third since the coalition came to power; what he did not say was that it is still expected to be \u00a3120bn this year \u2013 double what was envisaged in 2010.</p> <p>Osborne has already abandoned his original aim of sorting out the public finances in one parliament, with two extra years of deficit reduction pencilled in during the first two years after the 2015 election. on Monday, the chancellor went further, announcing that a Conservative government would run a budget surplus in the next parliament.</p> <p>This is some commitment. Capital spending on the UK's infrastructure will be \u00a325bn a year on existing plans and will rise in line with economic growth during the next parliament. The&#xa0;Treasury will need to squeeze current spending if it is to achieve an overall surplus.</p> <p>Is this possible? The ringfencing of spending on the NHS, schools and overseas development means that there have already been deep cuts in the budgets of other Whitehall departments. Researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain's leading thinktank on tax and spending matters, were already sceptical about whether spending on the police, the courts and other non-ringfenced activities could be cut much further even before Osborne's latest pledge.</p> <p>That's not to say it is impossible for a surplus to be run in the next parliament. It will, however, require two things: reductions in welfare spending and a prolonged period of steady growth. The chancellor admitted that without the latter, his plan would be a dead duck.</p> <p>Growth prospects look good in the short term. The economy grew by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2013 and the City is expecting a similar rate of expansion in the third quarter. Bringing forward phase two of Help to Buy, the government scheme to subsidise house buying, from early 2014 to next week will help to keep the property market humming.</p> <p>Osborne staunchly defended Help to Buy, and it is backed by the CBI, which says it was vital in turning the economy around earlier this year.

The Dove and Ben &amp; Jerry's business said it was on track to meet its 2013 priorities but said emerging markets had seen weaker growth in the third quarter, partly due to currency weakening. Developed markets remained flat to down, meaning overall growth for the quarter would be 3% to 3.5%. In the second quarter it saw a 5% rise in underlying sales. Reckitt Benckiser edged up 2p to \u00a345.20 despite a sell not from Liberum. It said: The debate on Reckitt shares is more on how to value Pharmaceuticals (21% of earnings in 2012) than on the core business. Taking reasonable 11 to 12 times EBITDA multiples for the core unit implies an enterprise value for Pharmaceuticals of \u00a36bn to \u00a38bn which could only be justified if Pharmaceuticals' earnings grew 50%-100% in 2014 \u2013 we find that unrealistic given current competitive dynamics and recent earnings trends. Liberum was more positive on ITV, down 0.5p at 175.3p: Press reports out that ITV has sold the old Granada TV studios in Manchester for \u00a326.5m subject to redevelopment planning permission. Probably not included within analyst forecasts for cashflow (it is not in ours; we have 2013 net cash of \u00a3194m) so gives ITV more flexibility if it wants to return cash. William Hill added 1p to 403p after signing a partnership agreement with gaming system specialist Net Entertainment to distribute its casino games over the UK bookmaker's network. But rival Ladbrokes lost another 2.5p to 169.2p after falling 9% in the wake of Thursday's profit warning, which was mainly due to a shortfall in its digital division.",

    "webTitle": "Turn crown estate into sovereign wealth fund, Labour MPs to urge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's \u00a38.6bn crown estate should be turned into a sovereign wealth fund to rival government-backed investment funds that have sprung up across Europe, the Middle East and Asia in the last 20 years, a group of Labour MPs will say this week. The MPs will tell the Co-op party's annual conference on Friday that the crown estate, which comprises vast tracts of land and commercial property across the UK, should be freed up to invest in foreign property and much-needed infrastructure projects in Britain. Gareth Thomas, chair of the Co-op party's group of 33 Labour MPs, said such a sovereign wealth fund could boost growth and help pay the UK's debts. Thomas said: \"A British sovereign wealth fund could promote co-operation with fast-growing overseas businesses, earning the UK vital income over the long term. \"Modernising the rules governing the crown estate could, for example, allow it to invest in up-and-coming property markets in G20 states like China and India or in new technology businesses, helping Britain secure access to innovative ideas developed abroad.\" The estate manages the \u00a38.6bn of land and property that the crown owns, but which the Queen does not control and cannot sell. The estate is accountable to parliament, and pays its surplus income to the Treasury to offset the cost of maintaining the royal family. The Treasury said there were no plans to develop a UK sovereign wealth fund to rival the \u00a315bn French and \u00a3875m Italian government funds, though the local government minister, Eric Pickles, is consulting on whether to create a \"superfund\" from the UK's assorted state pension schemes, which have amassed almost \u00a3200bn in assets. There are 89 local government pension schemes, with around \u00a3150bn under management; several others, including the Royal Mail pension scheme and the fund for MPs' pensions, have built up assets from investments in shares and bonds. However, pension funds are excluded from the list of sovereign wealth funds, which are expected to generate wealth for the nation as a whole. Thomas said that, with a change in the law lifting restrictions that limit it to property and land in Britain, the crown estate could become a sovereign wealth fund and develop its investment strategy. Last year the estate generated a surplus of \u00a3253m from its investments after making an 11.9% annual return. The bedrock of the estate is the Prince Regent's London property holdings, built 200 years ago, which run from Regent's Park through Oxford Circus and Regent Street to St James's Park. Seabeds managed by the estate are leased to offshore windfarms, and land across the UK is home to many other renewable energy schemes, business parks and factories. The fund was boosted last year by the acquisition of the Coliseum shopping park, in Cheshire, and Silverlink shopping park, outside Newcastle. Lifting restrictions on the estate would, Thomas said, allow it \"to begin to explore ventures into overseas property markets, for example in the Asian Pacific region, where eight of the world's largest 20 property markets are located, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India, or taking a stake in companies set up to bring new technologies to market\". Most of the largest funds rely on oil and other commodity revenues to boost their assets under management. Norway already has a \u00a3460bn sovereign wealth fund generated from taxes on its oil and gas industry. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China have also amassed huge wealth in funds that have become active investors in foreign markets, including the UK. It is estimated that government-backed funds account for around $30tr (\u00a318.5tr) of global assets, the same as the estimated $30tr of pension funds' assets. Since the beginning of 2008, which marks the high point for most stock and bond markets, funds registered with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute have increased their assets by 59%. Much of the gain is from oil and gas revenues, which soared after the eurozone crisis caused a wholesale price rise. The top 15 sovereign wealth funds, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute 1. Norway (Government Pension Fund Global): $737.2bn 2. Saudi Arabia (SAMA Foreign Holdings): $675.9bn 3. UAE-Abu Dhabi (Abu Dhabi Investment Authority): $627bn 4. China (China Investment Corp): $575.2 billion 5. China (SAFE Investment Co): $567.9 bn 6. Kuwait (Kuwait Investment Authority): $386bn 7.

      "body": "<p>Britain's \u00a38.6bn crown estate should be turned into a sovereign wealth fund to rival government-backed investment funds that have sprung up across Europe, the Middle East and Asia in the last 20 years, a group of Labour MPs will say this week.</p> <p>The MPs will tell the Co-op party's annual conference on Friday that the crown estate, which comprises vast tracts of land and commercial property across the UK, should be freed up to invest in foreign property and much-needed infrastructure projects in Britain.</p> <p>Gareth Thomas, chair of the Co-op party's group of 33 Labour MPs, said such a sovereign wealth fund could boost growth and help pay the UK's debts.</p> <p>Thomas said: \"A British sovereign wealth fund could promote co-operation with fast-growing overseas businesses, earning the UK vital income over the long term.</p> <p>\"Modernising the rules governing the crown estate could, for example, allow it to invest in up-and-coming property markets in G20 states like China and India or in new technology businesses, helping Britain secure access to innovative ideas developed abroad.\"</p> <p>The estate manages the \u00a38.6bn of land and property that the crown owns, but which the Queen does not control and cannot sell. The estate is accountable to parliament, and pays its surplus income to the Treasury to offset the cost of maintaining the royal family.</p> <p>The Treasury said there were no plans to develop a UK sovereign wealth fund to rival the \u00a315bn French and \u00a3875m Italian government funds, though the local government minister, Eric Pickles, is consulting on whether to create a \"superfund\" from the UK's assorted state pension schemes, which have amassed almost \u00a3200bn in assets.</p> <p>There are 89 local government pension schemes, with around \u00a3150bn under management; several others, including the Royal Mail pension scheme and the fund for MPs' pensions, have built up assets from investments in shares and bonds.</p> <p>However, pension funds are excluded from the list of sovereign wealth funds, which are expected to generate wealth for the nation as a whole.</p> <p>Thomas said that, with a change in the law lifting restrictions that limit it to property and land in Britain, the crown estate could become a sovereign wealth fund and develop its investment strategy.</p> <p>Last year the estate generated a surplus of \u00a3253m from its investments after making an 11.9% annual return. The bedrock of the estate is the Prince Regent's London property holdings, built 200 years ago, which run from Regent's Park through Oxford Circus and Regent Street to St James's Park.</p> <p>Seabeds managed by the estate are leased to offshore windfarms, and land across the UK is home to many other renewable energy schemes, business parks and factories. The fund was boosted last year by the acquisition of the Coliseum shopping park, in Cheshire, and Silverlink shopping park, outside Newcastle.</p> <p>Lifting restrictions on the estate would, Thomas said, allow it \"to begin to explore ventures into overseas property markets, for example in the Asian Pacific region, where eight of the world's largest 20 property markets are located, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India, or taking a stake in companies set up to bring new technologies to market\".</p> <p>Most of the largest funds rely on oil and other commodity revenues to boost their assets under management. Norway already has a \u00a3460bn sovereign wealth fund generated from taxes on its oil and gas industry. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China have also amassed huge wealth in funds that have become active investors in foreign markets, including the UK.</p> <p>It is estimated that government-backed funds account for around $30tr (\u00a318.5tr) of global assets, the same as the estimated $30tr of pension funds' assets. Since the beginning of 2008, which marks the high point for most stock and bond markets, funds registered with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute have increased their assets by 59%. Much of the gain is from oil and gas revenues, which soared after the eurozone crisis caused a wholesale price rise.</p> <h2>The top 15 sovereign wealth funds, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute</h2> <p>1. Norway (Government Pension Fund Global): $737.2bn</p> <p>2. Saudi Arabia (SAMA Foreign Holdings): $675.9bn</p> <p>3. UAE-Abu Dhabi (Abu Dhabi Investment Authority): $627bn</p> <p>4.

Eurostar and Keolis, both majority-owned by the French state rail operator, SNCF, have announced a joint venture to bid for the contract. The Department for Transport (DfT) will start vetting bidders next month, with a view to restoring the line to the private sector in March 2015. The east coast franchise is currently run by a government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways (DOR). It was brought in to operate the line as East Coast after National Express defaulted on the London-Edinburgh franchise in 2009, when the transport group admitted it could not afford the \u00a31.4bn in payments due over the life of the contract. By contrast, East Coast has paid more than \u00a3600m in premiums to the government over the past two years. Labour has said it would keep the east coast mainline in public hands. At its conference the shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, attacked the \"nonsense\" of allowing foreign state-backed firms to run UK railway franchises while excluding DOR. Deutsche Bahn, the German state-owned rail company, is also a prominent player in Britain through its ownership of Arriva, the business that operates the Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry and Arriva Trains Wales franchises. The DfT has said it will try to attract bids from as many international firms as possible in order to promote competition. A bidders' day in July attracted interest from firms in Europe and the far east. Keolis, which already operates four train franchises in the UK in a partnership with Go-Ahead Group, will be the lead partner in the bid, with a minority share to be held by Eurostar. It marks a further potential expansion for Eurostar, which last week announced it would start direct services between London and Amsterdam. Alistair Gordon, chief executive of Keolis UK, said: \"What's exciting about the east coast mainline is that there is an opportunity to transform a hugely important national route, which is yet to see the same levels of investment as the west coast mainline.\" The successful bidder for the franchise is expected to be awarded a contract in October 2014, with the franchise commencing in early 2015. Richard Branson has indicated that Virgin will bid for the route, probably along with Stagecoach, his partner in Virgin Rail. However, National Express has ruled itself out of the east coast bidding.",

Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: If investors had been hoping that common sense would prevail over the weekend, in either Italy or the US for that matter, then they would have ended up sorely disappointed. Given the protagonists involved in events either side of the Atlantic any other outcome, would probably have been wishful thinking and so it has proved. The effect on the fragile US economy cannot be overstated as federal employees get put on temporary leave, causing drops in economic output, consumer spending, retail sales and other related economic indicators. Even if this particular pot hole is somehow avoided the thorny problem of the raising of the debt ceiling by October 17 is the next carbuncle for markets to obsess about. The small matter of the latest US employment report, due Friday, could well be the victim of any US government shutdown, though we will still get sight of the September US ADP jobs report on Wednesday for further clues about the health of the US labour market. On top of that an HSBC manufacturing survey came in at 50.2, up from 50.1 but lower than the initial reading of 51.2. So mining shares were among the leading fallers on worries of falling demand from a key customer, with Anglo American 34.5p lower at 1505.5p and Glencore Xstrata down 7.6p at 336.4p.",

      "bodyText": "The energy company SSE has warned that first-half profits will be lower than last year and said it would remain \"disciplined\" despite the fierce political debate ignited by Ed Miliband's energy price freeze pledge. The FTSE 100 company in an update said adjusted profit before tax for the six months to 30 September was expected to be lower than the same period in 2012, reflecting higher wholesale gas prices and other costs. SSE said it was on track to meet its target of increasing the dividend for the current year by more than retail price inflation. Shares in SSE and other energy companies were hit last week by the Labour leader's latest policy plans, which were unveiled at the party's annual conference and would see prices frozen for 20 months to the end of 2017. \"Despite the intensifying political debate, we will maintain our operational and financial discipline, to enable us to deliver an above-inflation increase in the dividend for this financial year and beyond,\" said the finance director, Gregor Alexander, on Monday. It emerged on Friday that SSE is considering plans to scale back its investment in marine and tidal power projects, putting Britain's leading role in new technology at risk. It follows similar moves by other major energy players, and the lobby group RenewableUK warned that a difficult regulatory environment had depressed forecasts of how much capacity could be deployed and slowed the progress of the sector. SSE said on Monday that first-half profits were likely to account for a lower proportion of full-year profits but that it \"should have no implications for the full financial year\". \"Despite challenging energy market conditions, SSE has made solid progress in recent months, including taking a number of specific steps to help small business customers and improve standards for household customers. \"We continue to benefit from maintaining a balanced range of energy businesses,\" said Alexander.
