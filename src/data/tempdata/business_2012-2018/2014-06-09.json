      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are being warned they are locked in a \"race to the bottom\" in a new report showing that a food price war dragged sales lower last month. The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like food sales fell by an annual rate of 2.2% during March to May, in contrast to a year earlier when turnover grew 0.7%. On one measure, it was the worst quarter for food sales since BRC records began in 2008. Non-food sales were better, buoyed by demand for TVs for the World Cup and summer clothes. \"While non-food retailers are seeing steady sales growth, the grocers appear locked in a race to the bottom, imposing price cut after price cut to maintain their sales volumes,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report's co-authors, KPMG. \"This price war is hindering the retail sector's overall recovery.\" Falling by 0.2%, food sales turned negative for the first time on record when measured in total rather than like-for-like terms and after excluding Easter distortions, the BRC said. The figures echo a report last week from the trade group showing food price inflation holding at a record low in May and prices overall in British shops falling. The deflation trend has eased the pressure on households after years of budgets squeezed by weak pay growth but caused concern among retailers. This latest research pointed to a growing divide between food and non-food sales. The BRC said clothing was the best performing category in May, helped by warmer weather. Aside from the usual boost to televisions, the World Cup saw demand pick up for collectibles and sticker magazines. Overall, sales growth for non-food items accelerated to 3.2% in like-for-like terms, ahead of 0.7% a year earlier. Taken together with food, that left overall retail sales up an annual 0.8%, just ahead of 0.7% a year earlier. For May alone, like-for-like retail sales were up 0.5%, down from 4.2% annual growth in April when figures were distorted by the later timing of Easter this year. Looking ahead, experts say retailers can draw some hope from the World Cup. \"Overall food and grocery sales for May were a further disappointment. For food retailers, it will be essential to capitalise on opportunities provided by the summer events and the World Cup in particular,\" said Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive at IGD, the data company providing the BRC report's food figures. Retailers will be hoping England play well enough to stay in Brazil beyond the group stage, says Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"The better England do and the more games they play, the bigger the potential beneficial impact to retail sales. And if England do well, it could give a small, temporary boost to consumer confidence, although this is already elevated at the moment,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds Banking Group pushes TSB float with low share price", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has underlined its determination to entice investors to back the stock market flotation of TSB by pricing shares in the new bank below its own valuation of the 631 branch network. TSB would be valued at \u00a31.3bn, less than the \u00a31.5bn value of its assets, at the mid point of the range for the shares outlined by the 24% state-owned bank. The move is intended to overcome any investor fatigue for new companies joining the stock market. The 322-page prospectus, published by TSB \u2013 in which the bank styles itself as a new challenger to the \"big four\" players \u2013 illustrates the close ties that will remain with Lloyds even after the share sale. There is a 10-year agreement over IT systems, including a pledge from Lloyds to pay \u00a3450m towards building a new computer system for TSB. Lloyds will also cover any bills for conduct costs, such as payment protection insurance mis-selling, and pension liabilities for the 8,600 TSB staff. The prospectus also outlines a series of risk warnings facing the standalone bank. They include risks associated with independence for Scotland \u2013 where it has 27% of its 4.5 million customers \u2013 together with political intervention before the general election next May and the TSB's ability to compete with the existing major players on the high street. Lloyds will receive \u00a3179m a year in fees for its IT support. Lloyds was supposed to have already sold off the branches, code-named Verde, under the terms of a deal thrashed out with the EU at the time of the \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. But after talks with the Co-operative Bank collapsed a year ago, Lloyds took the alternative route of a stock market flotation, which must now be completed by the end of 2015, or the end of 2016 in extreme circumstances. A quarter of Lloyds's stake in the specially carved-out branches \u2013 former outlets of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and other branches in Scotland, England and Wales \u2013 is being sold off at this first attempt, which should be completed on 20 June. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said he expected TSB to be priced at the bottom of the 220p to 280p range outlined by Lloyds. \"There is the scent of hubris about, with management and advisers convinced that with the tightly controlled flow of information and the massaging of retail demand, they can push this one through,\" said Chen. Retail investors are being offered one free share for every 20 they buy, provided that they hold them for a year. The TSB prospectus shows that Lloyds is also helping the newly spun-off bank - which has been back on the high streets since September - to become more profitable by handing over an extra \u00a33.4bn of loans, which are expected to generate \u00a3230m of additional profit by 2017. TSB made profits of \u00a3172m last year and does not expect to be generating enough surplus to pay dividends to shareholders until the end of the 2017 financial year \u2013which means the first payments are not likely to be made until May 2018. The bank's profitability has been held back by its mortgage book, which it admits has low margins relative to rivals as it has a range that is capped at 2%, while the market average is almost 4%. The bank also reveals that 45% of its mortgage customers have interest-only mortgages and that it does not know how some of them intend to repay their loans. Even so, expansion in the mortgage market is cited as the main area of growth for TSB. The bank will start offering products through brokers again next year, after being forced to end this crucial sales channel while it remained in talks with the Co-op Bank. The new boss, Paul Pester, whose \u00a31.6m outstanding bonuses from Lloyds are to be transferred to TSB, is also aiming for growth in current accounts, where it has only 4.2% market share despite having some 6% of high street branches. TSB is attracting new customers through its new account offering 5% interest rates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, says he is disappointed with the retailer's performance since he left the business in 2011. The supermarket posted its worst UK sales performance in decades last week \u2013 a 3.8% decline in like-for-like sales. Leahy said: \"As a shareholder, I'm disappointed with the performance and I'm sure the board will take whatever action is necessary to improve performance.\" Leahy, speaking at the International Festival for Business in his home city of Liverpool, was asked whether he had left a difficult task for his successor, Philip Clarke. \"I think that if you had invested a pound in Tesco during my time as chief executive, you would be very happy. We grew sales and profits every year for 14 years,\" Leahy replied. Leahy's predecessor, Lord MacLaurin, has been less diplomatic about Tesco's decline. He launched an outspoken attack on his former protege's record in 2013, saying Leahy had \"lost the plot\" and embarked on a \"disastrous\" foray into the US. Since quitting the US, Tesco has continued to suffer in the UK, where the market is being transformed by discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, the rise of online shopping and the popularity of convenience stores. David Cameron also appeared at the event in Liverpool, telling senior business figures that more needed to be done to shift the British economy away from the financial services industry in London. The prime minister said the UK was \"on its way back from the great recession\" but rebalancing the economy away from banking was still a work in progress. \"Our economy became too reliant on financial services. Financial services is a great industry. Don't get me wrong: the City of London is an enormous asset for the UK. But financial services isn't enough for an economy,\" he said. \"We want to see Britain invent more things, design more things, manufacture more things and export more things. Made in Britain is once again a badge of pride. The rebalancing is happening but it needs to go further and it needs to go faster.\" Cameron said the UK needed an \"active industrial policy\" to ensure there was a better balance, with some signs appearing of robust growth outside the capital. Employment was rising fastest in north-east England, exports were increasing fastest in the West Midlands and new apprenticeships were highest in north-west England, he said. There are fears the UK's recovery \u2013 GDP is expected to grow 2.7% this year \u2013 is being driven too much by rising house prices in London and south-east England. The International Monetary Fund backed the government's economic programme last week but warned that the housing market was a threat to economic stability. Responding to those fears, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland have both said they will limit lending for mortgages of \u00a3500,000 or more in London, where asking prices are said to have risen by \u00a34,500 a week this year. Ana Botin, chief executive of Santander, historically Britain's second-biggest mortgage lender, told an audience in Liverpool that her bank had also adjusted its lending criteria in response to surging London prices but had chosen not to go public. \"We have been taking measures on prudential risk. We are all over the country and our business [on homes worth more than \u00a3500,000] isn't that big. It's about how you combine loan to value with affordability and the length of the mortgage and so on. We don't announce when we change our risk [approach]. We do that once or maybe twice a year.\" Lord Heseltine, a Tory champion of industrial policy during the Thatcher and Major governments, told the event that the government's policies for reinvigorating cities and industry were starting to pay off, but warned it would take many years to address the UK's skills shortage. \"There is nothing we can do about it in the short term. We need bucketloads of engineers, but you can't just say to the schools and the universities, 'Give me engineers'. It takes 10 years.\" In the meantime, the UK would have to import engineers to build up manufacturing, he said. Jim O'Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs who now chairs the City Growth Commission, said the economy had shown \"significant improvements\" with growth appearing to accelerate in the past two months and employment picking up. To make the most of the recovery, businesses needed to target Chinese consumers, he said.",

She says Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has clearly decided to go with the non-partisan technocrat route by appointing Hardouvelis, who has already had government experience overseeing economic policy during the short-lived technocrat government headed by former european central bank vice president Lucas Papademos.</p> <p> Hardouvelis (writes Helena):<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>a) takes a hard line stance with the troika;</p> <p> b) is very worried about political stability and rise of golden dawn;</p> <p>c) is pragmatic but</p> <p> d) is personally painfully aware of the sacrifices Greeks have had to make - especially \"decent, law-abiding Greeks who contrary to popular opinion pay their taxes,\" he told me not that long ago. </p> <p>The troika, he felt, often failed to treat the government with the due respect it deserved, forgetting that it was negotiating with elected MPs in Athens.</p> <p>He's no-nonsense, open-minded, cosmopolitan, hard-working and capable and will for sure have the backing of the centre-left Pasok, the ruling conservative new democracy party's junior partner in the coalition. The finance ministry will be a post that he will relish.</p> <p>His appointment was part of a reshuffle that was bigger than expected with eight ministers withdrawing from government posts and Pasok gaining strength in representation across the board - in a reflection of the drubbing the New Democrats got in the elections. Nikos Dendias, the hard-lined public order minister was replaced as was Adonis Georgiadis who has whipped up a storm of controversy with his handling of affairs as the public health minister. </p> </blockquote> <p><i>And with that, it's time to shut up shop once more.</i><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-09T16:43:25.959Z\">at 5.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5395d0cde4b0a65f81da34a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-09T15:29:28.309Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So here's some news on the Greek government reshuffle.

      "bodyText": "Gikas Hardouvelis, the new Greek finance minister, is a US-trained economist, economics professor and bank advisor, writes Helena Smith. She says Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has clearly decided to go with the non-partisan technocrat route by appointing Hardouvelis, who has already had government experience overseeing economic policy during the short-lived technocrat government headed by former european central bank vice president Lucas Papademos. Hardouvelis (writes Helena): a) takes a hard line stance with the troika; b) is very worried about political stability and rise of golden dawn; c) is pragmatic but d) is personally painfully aware of the sacrifices Greeks have had to make - especially \"decent, law-abiding Greeks who contrary to popular opinion pay their taxes,\" he told me not that long ago. The troika, he felt, often failed to treat the government with the due respect it deserved, forgetting that it was negotiating with elected MPs in Athens. He's no-nonsense, open-minded, cosmopolitan, hard-working and capable and will for sure have the backing of the centre-left Pasok, the ruling conservative new democracy party's junior partner in the coalition. The finance ministry will be a post that he will relish. His appointment was part of a reshuffle that was bigger than expected with eight ministers withdrawing from government posts and Pasok gaining strength in representation across the board - in a reflection of the drubbing the New Democrats got in the elections. Nikos Dendias, the hard-lined public order minister was replaced as was Adonis Georgiadis who has whipped up a storm of controversy with his handling of affairs as the public health minister. And with that, it's time to shut up shop once more. So here's some news on the Greek government reshuffle. Economist Gikas Hardouvelis has become finance minister to replace Yannis Stournaras, who is expected to go to head up the Bank of Greece. Sounds like we might not get the Greek reshuffle results until tonight -- so at least that'll be something to discuss tomorrow.... As it's so quiet (apologies), I'm clocking off for a bit -- but we'll *roar* back into live if anything dramatic happens... The global stock market optimism has pushed the Dow Jones index to a new record high. The Dow gained 26 points to 16951, as New York traders follow the lead set by their counterparts in Europe and Asia (details here). The markets are generally calm this afternoon, says Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital: \"In the aftermath of the ECB's policy measures last Thursday and a decent U.S. jobs report on Friday, the mood in the financial markets remains positive.\" A very gentle start to trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones index has risen by 7 points, or less than 0.05%, in the opening exchanges. Speaking of the Greek reshuffle, there are reports that a junior minister from the finance office is leaving the government: That's Kostis Hatzidakis, development and competitiveness minister, I think. Rumours are swirling in Greece that prime minister Antonis Samaras has come up with a close personal friend -- US professor Nicholas Economides -- to replace finance minister Yannis Stournaras. Our correspondent Helena Smith has the latest on the much\u2013anticipated government shake-up: With the reshuffle aimed at rejuvenating his beleaguered government, the Greek prime minister has reportedly decidedly to place the US-based economics professor Nicholas Economides at the helm of the finance ministry. A faculty member of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and a visiting fellow at the University of California at Berkeley, Economides is a wild-card (no other diaspora Greek has held the post) but would inject freshness into a cabinet that has come under criticism, even among reformists, of protecting vested interests. As a close personal friend of Antonis Samaras, who himself attended Harvard\u2019s School of Business, Economides would also enjoy the exclusive trust of the prime minister as Greece attempts to move into a phase of self-regeneration after its worst recession on record. Samaras is known to want to focus on growth and development, seeing unemployment (at nearly 27% the highest in the EU) as by far the country's most serious problem. Economide\u2019s \u201cresearch interests\u201d include industrial organization, network industries, structure of financial markets and law and economics according to his CV. A good fit for the negotiations on the ever present problem of Greece\u2019s debt load that are also expected to begin before the end of the year. As flagged earlier, Stournaras, who has held the post since June 2012, is expected to become the next governor of the Bank of Greece. Stournaras spoke to reporters in Athens this morning, and said: \"The day that I will leave will be a very difficult day for me ... it will be a very difficult day for me because I have given so much to it.\" Over in America, McDonalds has just posted another disappointing month's sales in its home territory. Comparable sales slid by 1.0% in May in the US, which it blamed on \"ongoing broad-based challenges\". That took some of the shine off a stronger performance in Asia, where sales jumped 2.5%. Europe's comparable sales rose 0.4% in May led by the UK and France, but sales fell in Germany. McDonald's sales have been disappointing in the US throughout 2014; president and CEO Don Thompson insists the fast food giant can turn things around: We are intensifying our commitment to place the customer at the center of everything we do and are determined to create experiences that deliver the most meaningful impact for our customers and our business.\" Global stock markets are on the brink of hitting a new all-time high, as recent economic news from the US and Japan push up shares. And eurozone peripheral bonds remain at historic highs, as traders drive the prices of bonds issued by Spain and Ireland to levels where they're seen as cheaper than US debt. The MSCI All-World share index (which tracks equities in 45 countries) has risen to 427.1 points. That's just 0.25% off its record high of 428.63, hit in October 2007 as the financial crisis struck. The rally in Asia overnight sparked by Japan's GDP upgrade (see opening post), and lingering optimism following Friday's US jobs data, has helped to support European markets today. Peter Sullivan, HSBC's head of equity strategy in Europe, told Reuters that the rally will probably continue. \"We got more confirmation last week that [eurozone monetary] policy is going to remain very loose for a long time.\" \"In the U.S. it's clear that earnings are coming back pretty strongly and there are even signs of life now in Europe ... So you put that together and it's certainly more likely that equities rise rather than fall from here.\" The FTSE 100 is up 17 points at 6875 -- just 75 points off its record closing high. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, says the Footsie could soon hit a new record high, although he worries that the current valuations are rather risky... We\u2019ve been able to dust off the \u2018all time highs\u2019 moniker for the DAX and US indices recently, but the FTSE 100 version remains in the cupboard unused. We may, however finally be seeing the index making another run towards the recent high of 6894 and then on to 6900, as the London market looks to emulate its cousins in Germany and the US. [But] Even with an easing European Central Bank and in-line US job numbers, the index still looks uncomfortable at these levels. And as flagged up earlier, Spanish bond yields have fallen below the yields on US Treasury bills..... ...and Irish borrowing costs have also hit a record low as the eurozone debt rally shows no signs of burning out. Although Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities warned that prices have simply risen too high as investors scrabble to find a return on their money: in the long run this is the road to the next crisis and ruination. Just in: China's central bank has reportedly lowered the \"reserve requirements\" imposed on some of its commercial banks. The move, which was rumoured to be coming soon, frees up more cash to be lent to Chinese consumers and firms. Here's the news snaps off the Reuters' terminal: CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK SAYS TO CUT RESERVE REQUIREMENT RATIOS FOR SELECTED BANKS BY 50 BPS CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK SAYS CUT IS EFFECTIVE FROM JUNE 16 09-Jun-2014 CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK SAYS CURRENT LIQUIDITY IS AMPLE, MONETARY POLICY DIRECTION HAS NOT CHANGED CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK SAYS MONETARY POLICY TO BE KEPT PRUDENT Back in the UK, former Tesco CEO Sir Terry Leahy has weighed in on the supermarket chain's problems, saying he's \"disappointed\" with its current performance. Leahy left Tesco in 2011, and the company has been on the slide ever since - and just suffered its worst quarter in decades. With hindsight, he clearly got out at the top, before the flaws in its strategy of mega-stores at home and aggressive expansion abroad were fully exposed. Greek newspapers reckon the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle could come today, including a new finance minister to replace Yannis Stournaras (who will probably become Bank of Greece governor) Kathimerini reports: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras met with former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis on Friday, sparking speculation that the New Democracy MP might succeed Yannis Stournaras as finance minister. With Spanish government bonds now changing hands at lower interest rates than US Treasury bonds*, analysts are wondering quite how historic the ongoing rally in eurozone bond yields really is. Well, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid has taken a stab at it -- he claims we're now seeing the lowest borrowing costs for France, Italy and Spain in a couple of hundred years. More here on fast FT... Although it's not quite clear how accurate these calculations can be... * - Spain's 10-year bonds are yielding just under 2.6% today; the US equivalent is yielding 2.61%. Interesting piece in the Wall Street Journal today about the impact of adjusting Europe GDP data to include the Black Economy (sex workers, the drugs trade and other such shadowy activities) It explains that EU countries are standardising and broadening their GDP measures to include areas not currently monitored -- which could actually help country's hit debt targets imposed by Brussels: If a nation's deficit must remain below 3% of GDP, a profligate government would want the largest possible estimate of GDP. For others, a higher GDP may end up costing governments more. The 28-nation bloc uses measures of GDP to determine how much each country contributes to the EU's collective budget. Across Europe, Finland and Sweden, hardly nations characterized by vast criminal economies, would see the biggest boosts. The main changes result not from drugs but from technical adjustments such as how to capitalize expenditures on research and development and how to account for pension programs and most types of insurance policies. More here. Eurozone investors have not been cheered by the interest rate cuts and \u20ac400bn of new loans announced by the European Central Bank last week. Sentix's monthly survey of investor confidence fell this month, for the second month running, despite the ECB's moves -- and Mario Draghi's promise that more measures are possible. The research group warned: Investors judge the current situation to be much worse than in the previous month, and their 6-month expectations also declined. The survey took place between June 5th and 7th -- starting on the day of the ECB's announcement. Another example of how the boom in eurozone bonds has pushed borrowing costs sharply lower... Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities warns that the boom in eurozone government bonds will end in tears. He writes that banks are piling into sovereign debt rather than lose money by paying negative interest rates at the ECB, driving prices to levels that cannot be justified when measured against credit risk. As I have written many times this year, this is not an investment strategy, but a job preservation strategy, because if these guys resist and bemoan poor credit quality, they will underperform their peers and next thing they own is a P45! In the long run this is the road to the next crisis and ruination, but there are very few people who take a long-term view when it might cost them their job!\" The gap between the interest rates on UK and German government bonds has hit a new 16-year high today. While German Bunds have shared in the rally in eurozone debt today, UK gilts have weakened. This pushed the gap in the yields between their respective 10-year bonds to over 133 basis points (with German debt yielding just 1.35% compared to the UK's 2.68%). That difference reflects the UK's stronger growth prospects, and the likelihood that the Bank of England will start raising interest rates by early 2015. Eurozone government bonds are rallying this morning, as the stimulus measures announced by the European Central Bank last week continue to ripple through the markets. Irish debt has also benefitted from S&amp;P upgrading Ireland's credit rating on Friday night. This has driven down the interest rate (yield) on its 10-year bonds to just 2.415%, a euro-era record low. Orlando Green, a strategist at Credit Agricole, says \"investors are grabbing yields while they can\", anticipating further action from the ECB if last week's package of interest rate cuts and fresh cheap credit for banks doesn't do the trick. I should flag up this article from the Observer yesterday by Athens correspondent Helena Smith on Greece's Golden Dawn party, whose leaders were stripped of their immunity to prosecution last week: SS songs and antisemitism: the week Golden Dawn turned openly Nazi Heads-up: the UK prime minister is banging the drum for British enterprise in Liverpool today, at the opening day of the International Festival for Business in Liverpool. David Cameron isn't holding back, either --apparently he'll declare that Britain is a \"nation of geniuses\"* that can become the \"most creative country on Earth\". David Cameron opens business festival for 'nation of geniuses' * Bold stuff. Britain's certainly boasts a deep bench of outstanding thinkers and pioneers (Newton, Darwin, Brunel, Stephenson, Watt, Bell, Turing and Berners-Lee for starters). But it's not alone - Germany's Unsere Besten list is hard to beat, for starters. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, cites three reasons for stock markets inching higher: A positive US jobs report on Friday, better Chinese trade data over the weekend and an upward revision to Japan\u2019s Q1 GDP has provided a positive start to the week on what could be a quiet day on account of European holidays. That Chinese trade data showed that exports rose by 7% year-on-year in May - indicating a pick-up in global demand. But on which side of the Atlantic? Evan Lucas of IG suggests three options: Has the ECB\u2019s foretelling of its rates decision in June has seen importers pre-ordering inventory for the expected increase in consumption as credit becomes even cheaper? Has US data over the past three months raised expectations heading into the summer of increased spending and a US economy that is now standing on its own two feet? Or has the targeted easing measures from the PBoC and the central government help pushed supply surpluses? European stock markets have risen modestly in early trading, after Asian markets hit the highest level since July 2011. The FTSE 100's up 13 points at 6872; dragged down a little by Lloyds, down 1.5% after announcing it is selling TSB for a substantial discount on its book value. Italy's MIB has gained 0.3%, while the German DAX and French CAC are a little higher. Robert the Bruce might approve of Sports Direct's relentless attempts to give billionaire founder Mike Ashley a huge performance-related bonus, but its shareholders may not. SPD is making a third stab at giving executive deputy chairman Ashley the chance to deepen his already swelling pockets, through a newly drafted \"2015 Bonus Share Scheme\". That scheme would allow all employees, including Ashley, to share 25 million shares worth around \u00a3200m at today's share price. Two months ago, City shareholders humiliated SPD by forcing it to ditch a plan to give Ashley a \u00a370m bonus. Ashley promptly sold \u00a3200m of shares, sending SPD's price sliding over 9%. This new proposal has been created \"following feedback received from shareholders\". Ashley, who still owns almost 58% of the company, toils away without receiving a salary. He did come 23rd on the Sunday Times' 2014 Rich list, but Keith Hellawell, Sports Direct's chairman, insists Ashley should share in the company's future success: \"The Board and the Remuneration Committee have responded to the feedback received from shareholders to develop a long-term share incentive scheme which not only will continue to motivate the Company's employees but which also recognises and rewards the substantial contribution made by Mike Ashley over many years. \" To pay out, SPD would have to maintain its recent strong performance, by growing its underlying earnings to \u00a3480m in 2016, rising to \u00a3750m in 2019. It's aiming for \u00a3310m this year, up from \u00a3287.9m in 2013. Over to the City, and Lloyds Banking Group has priced the flotation of its TSB banking arm - at a substantial reduction to its face value. Lloyds is going to sell 25% of TSB at between 220 pence and 290 pence each, giving it a mid-price of \u00a31.275bn. That's someway shy of the 'book value' of between \u00a31.5bn and \u00a31.6bn -- what you might call \"priced to go\". We reported this morning that 2014 is turning into a record year for IPOs, as companies dash to join the stock market (before the current rally suffers a reversal?....) Britain gripped by flotation fever But with signs that investors are sated (see Saga's pricing problem), Lloyds clearly doesn't want to risk the TSB float - demanded by Brussels - flopping. The Japan Times has more details of the newly upgraded Japanese GDP figures: Corporate capital spending, which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Cabinet considers to be key for shoring up the economy, jumped 7.6 percent from the previous quarter, upgraded from a 4.9 percent increase in the preliminary report. Private consumption \u2014 accounting for roughly 60 percent of Japan\u2019s GDP \u2014 was also upwardly revised to a 2.2 percent rise from 2.1 percent growth. Encouraging stuff...but Capital Economics points out that Japan's new 8% sales tax, introduced in April, is going to hit growth: \"Output will surely shrink this quarter as consumers rein in spending after the consumption tax hike....However, the slowdown in domestic demand should lead to a decline in import volumes, so net exports should finally add to growth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, business and the eurozone. Stock markets are starting the week in an optimistic mood, after Japanese economic growth rate was revised sharply higher. Japan's economy grew by a rip-roaring 6.7% on an annualised basis in the first three months of 2014, not the 5.9% first estimated, according to official figures. That's a 1.6% quarterly growth rate - which the Tokyo government says is the strongest since the third quarter of 2011. It comfortably outstripping the UK's 0.8% growth, and the eurozone's 0.2% [America shrank slightly during the quarter, thanks to bleak weather]. The upgrade was due to an sharp upwards revision in Japanese corporate capital spending -- it surged by 7.6% from the previous quarter, upgraded from 4.9%. That's an encouraging signal that Japan's Abenomics programme may be encouraging businesses to splash out on new investments. Last Friday's US jobs data had already driven Wall Street to record highs, and Asian markets have followed suit. The MCSI index of Asia-Pacific shares hit its highest level since July 2011 earlier today, with gains across the region. And in India, the Sensex index has hit a fresh record highs. So, up up up we go... But listen to traders, and there's plenty of nervousness that stock markets may be ripe for a correction. As Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria put it: \"It's remarkable how negative traders are feeling about this rally evidenced by the amount of clients that keep betting against it and getting short\". It's the Whitson holiday in Europe, so things could be a bit quieter - but I''ll be covering all the main events as usual....",

      "bodyText": "Should J Sainsbury and the other listed supermarkets stop investing so much their online services and concentrate instead on cutting prices in-store to head off the competitive threat of discounters Aldi and Lidl? In the view of analyst David McCarhy at HSBC, the answer is yes. He believes customers want cheap products more than they want home delivery. He issued an underweight rating on Sainsbury with a 280p price target and said: Market data shows that Sainsbury is losing share, despite around \u00a31bn capital expenditure last year.

The Bank's latest systemic risk survey of executives at hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions found that 40% cited falling property prices as a key risk. Their concern focused on residential property rather than the commercial end of the market and is likely to fan fears that house prices in some parts of the country are getting dangerously high. It was the third time in a row that the biannual poll has seen an increase in the proportion of financial executives worried about house price falls. The poll also revealed rising concerns about geopolitical risks against the backdrop of tensions in Ukraine and executives continued to highlight worries over the robustness of the eurozone. But overall, the Bank's risk survey showed that fears of a fresh financial crash continued to diminish. The perceived probabilities of a high-impact event in the UK financial system continued to fall, setting new lows since the survey began at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The poll of 72 market participants found almost two-thirds now consider the probability of a high-impact event to be low or very low over the next year. At 64%, that was up nine percentage points from half a year ago. Confidence in the UK financial system on average has also risen, but only slightly, the Bank said. There was a weaker consensus among respondents over what presented the biggest risk and their answers were less skewed towards one particular risk category. An economic downturn was identified as the main risk to the financial system, cited by 61% of executives. The importance of geopolitical risk grew markedly from a low base, with 57% now identifying it as a key risk now, up from 13% in the last survey. It is now the second most cited risk. On a par with worries about property price falls were concerns around sovereign debt, listed under the category sovereign risk. That was cited by 40% of participants, down by 33 percentage points but still relatively high, with the \"overwhelming majority of specific responses focusing on the eurozone\", the Bank said.",
