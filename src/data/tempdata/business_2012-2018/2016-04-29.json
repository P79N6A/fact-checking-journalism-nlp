      "bodyText": "The former owner of BHS loaned cash to a man connected to a convicted fraudster, raising further questions about its stewardship of the department store chain. The discovery, which contradicts statements made to the Guardian last year, follows a torrid week for the retailer which collapsed into administration on Monday, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The department store was owned by Retail Acquisitions \u2013 a consortium led by Dominic Chappell \u2013 which bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015. Retail Acquisitions lent money to Colin Sutton. Although not related, he has been a director of companies run by Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster who introduced Chappell to Sir Philip Green. BHS has been left with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m, with Green accused of making hundreds of millions of pounds from the retailer before selling it. The loan is important because Retail Acquisitions received more than \u00a325m of payments from BHS, and Chappell has previously insisted that he had cut ties with Paul Sutton. Chappell said the \u00a31.5m loan was paid to a property company connected to Chappell\u2019s father and used to pay off the mortgage on the older man\u2019s house. Land Registry documents show that the house in Sunbury-on-Thames was bought last July by a company called JDM Island Properties for \u00a3850,000, with Retail Acquisitions named as the lender. JDM was set up last April and only has one director and shareholder \u2013 Colin Sutton. The address given for JDM is the same as B52 Investments, Paul Sutton\u2019s private investment vehicle. Colin Sutton served as director for a Chappell family business in the 1990s, but also as a director last year for two of Paul Sutton\u2019s companies \u2013 Containasuite, a startup that planned to provide temporary accommodation, and B52 Investments. When contacted by the Guardian on Friday, Chappell denied that Colin Sutton and the loan was connected to Paul Sutton, but did not answer questions about why Colin Sutton had bought the property. He said: \u201cI have known Colin Sutton for over 30 years. He has worked with my father for most of this time. He is nothing to do with Paul Sutton, apart from doing book keeping work for him. \u201cJDM owns the house that my mother and father live in. RAL [Retail Acquisitions] using RAL money made a loan secured against the property.\u201d The Guardian first contacted Chappell about his connections to Colin Sutton in April 2015, but got a different response. He said he had \u201cno connection\u201d to Colin Sutton, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s an accountant, a local accountant. Absolutely no idea.\u201d When pressed on what he meant by \u201cno idea\u201d and on whether he knew about the connection with Paul Sutton, Chappell said: \u201cNo. He\u2019s not on any board of my company whatsoever, nor has been for a very long period of time.\u201d After being pointed out that he had been on the board of family businesses in the 1990s, Chappell added: \u201cIn the 90s. End of. He\u2019s an accountant stroke administrator \u2013 absolutely no idea.\u201d Just two days after the conversation between the Guardian and Chappell, JDM Island Properties was registered as a company at Companies House by Colin Sutton. Paul Sutton is a 59-year-old once bankrupt businessman who was found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002 and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. The case was unconnected with Chappell and Colin Sutton. Paul Sutton was in negotiations with Green during 2013 and 2014 about acquiring BHS, with Chappell part of the talks. When Green was tipped off about Sutton\u2019s background, the tycoon pulled out of talks. Chappell then pressed ahead with his own deal to buy BHS. Green demanded guarantees that Sutton was not involved in the deal. Last month, the Sunday Times revealed that Chappell and PSutton had set up a secret company in Panama less than a month after Retail Acquisitions acquired BHS. The pair owned 50% of Clarberry, which was incorporated in the tax haven on 1 April last year. Companies House records show that in 2014 Chappell was also briefly a director of Containasuite. He was on the board for about a month, and told the Guardian last year that he was hired by Sutton to work for Containasuite. More than 80% of Containasuite\u2019s shares are listed at Companies House as being owned by another firm called B52 Investments, which in turn is controlled byNicola Tarrant, who is Sutton\u2019s partner. The Guardian has seen paperwork showing that the former name of Retail Acquisitions \u2013 Swiss Rock \u2013 was used as a code name by Sutton when he was trying to buy BHS in 2014. Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds that were paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. BHS has written to Chappell asking him to repay \u00a350,000 that has not been repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before the store chain\u2019s collapse. Chappell moved \u00a31.5m into BHS Sweden, an unconnected company, last week as it became clear that BHS was heading for administration. When asked to return the cash by BHS management, Chappell paid it back \u00a350,000 short, saying this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish krona and back again. Chappell has said the funds had remained in the group, were for professional fees, and \u201call justifiable\u201d. The administrators to BHS are also examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions, Chappell\u2019s consortium, can be called in. Chappell said he \u201ccannot comment on the \u00a350k as this is a matter between BHS Sweden and the administrator\u201d. Paul Sutton and Colin Sutton could not be reached for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hundreds of workers who were blacklisted by large firms in an illegal conspiracy have won compensation following a long-running lawsuit. Approximately 420 trade unionists have secured damages from major construction firms after launching legal action four years ago. On Friday, they announced that they had reached out-of-court settlements with the firms. However, another group of approximately 90 workers have yet to settle and are scheduled to have their case heard in the high court on 9 May. It brings to more than 600 the number of workers who have received compensation from the illegal scheme, which was investigated and closed down by the authorities following an article in the Guardian in 2008. The amount of compensation has not been disclosed but, according to campaigners, could reach \u00a350m. It has been previously disclosed that some blacklisted workers have been awarded damages ranging from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000. Steve Acheson, the chair of the Blacklist Support Group, which represents the workers, said: \u201cWhat has already been achieved is a massive victory for the trade union movement, but the fight is not over yet. \u201cUntil such time that the the full conspiracy is exposed and those responsible for the human rights abuse are called to account in a court of law, we will never stop fighting.\u201d The legal action was launched after it was revealed that the firms were funding a secret system to blacklist thousands of workers who were subsequently prevented from getting jobs, often for long periods of time. In 2009, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), a watchdog body, closed down the blacklist after uncovering confidential files that were held on 3,200 workers and contained details of their working life and trade union activities. While the blacklist was operating, the construction firms would run the names of prospective workers through the files to check if they were classified as being troublemakers in the eyes of the firms\u2019 managers. Some workers had been blacklisted after they raised concerns about safety on construction sites. The legal action was taken against 30 firms and four executives, including Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O\u2019Rourke, Sir Robert McApline, Skanska UK and Vinci. In a short statement, the blacklisted workers represented by the Ucatt and GMB trade unions and the law firm Guney, Clark &amp; Ryan said the construction companies had offered financial settlements which had been \u201caccepted as fair and reasonable\u201d. The construction firms will pay the trade unionists\u2019 legal costs, which have not been disclosed. A joint statement agreed by the construction firms and blacklisted workers is to be read out in court next week. In October, the construction companies had admitted at a preliminary court hearing that the blacklist was unlawful and apologised to those damaged by it. More than 150 workers \u2013 represented by the Unite trade union \u2013 have previously secured damages. Evidence of the inner workings of the blacklist will be aired if the group of workers who have yet to settle their legal action go to trial in the high court. The existence of the blacklist \u2013 run out of an office in Droitwich, Worcestershire \u2013 began to be revealed in 2006 when a construction industry manager, Alan Wainwright, blew the whistle. He publicised how it operated and the names of the blacklisted workers on a website. This led to an article in the Guardian and then to a raid by investigators working for the ICO on the Consulting Association, which maintained the blacklist. Ian Kerr, who had run the operation and has since died, was fined \u00a35,000 for a data protection offence. Wainwright has launched legal action against more than 35 companies alleging that they are victimising him and denying him work. He has accused the firms of refusing to fairly consider him for jobs because of his role in uncovering the blacklist.",

      "bodyText": "Boots stands accused of \u201ctrying to deceive the public\u201d, after a letter sent to the Guardian purporting to be from an independent pharmacist was found to have been processed and extensively revised by the retailer\u2019s senior executives. Submitted this week by a self-described \u201cindependent pharmacist\u201d, the letter takes issue with the Guardian\u2019s \u201cportrayal of Boots\u201d for doing \u201cdamage ... to a profession I love\u201d. In an investigation published earlier this month, the Guardian revealed how managers at Britain\u2019s biggest chain of chemists have been forcing staff to milk NHS schemes to increase company profits. The correspondent adds: \u201cMy plea is that some balance is put back into your articles.\u201d The letter was emailed for publication as a Word document. On opening, it turned out to have a string of edits, amendments and corrections left in as \u201ctrack changes\u201d. The changes were made by Laura Vergani, a vice-president at Walgreens Boots Alliance, the multinational company that owns Boots. The letter makes no mention of Boots\u2019s involvement in its production, even though it repeatedly defends the company and the NHS schemes it has been exploiting for profit. The Guardian\u2019s investigation prompted a flood of letters from Boots chemists, who condemned the company\u2019s working practices and scalping of the health service. Some even claimed that they had been driven to contemplate suicide. The letter observes \u201cwithin any large organisation such as Boots there will be people that engage in new ways of working and those that do not\u201d. When its writer, Nick Kaye, was contacted by the Guardian he initially denied that Boots had touched the letter. On being told that the changes and who had made them were visible, he said: \u201cThe only amendment I thought they added was the [publication] date of the story.\u201d The publication date was just one of 17 amendments made by Vergani, along with numerous deletions, corrections and spelling changes. Kaye said he submitted the letter on 21 April to another senior executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance, Tricia Kennerley. It seems to have been passed on to Vergani, and edited the next day over what appears to be at least two sessions. The letter was submitted to the Guardian on 24 April. Kaye claimed the only changes made were to his grammar and spelling \u2013 not to the content or the \u201cethos\u201d. \u201cI am not good at comms,\u201d the Newquay-based pharmacist said. \u201cI am not an expert at national newspapers.\u201d Editing the letter was \u201ca common courtesy,\u201d said Vergani, the vice-president of external communications at Walgreens Boots Alliance, who described her work on the letter as \u201csome small grammatical changes\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s totally normal \u2026 it\u2019s a comms job,\u201d she said. However, when asked how often a vice-president at the \u00a360bn multinational edited letters from members of the public, she admitted: \u201cNever.\u201d In the two weeks since the Guardian published its investigation, Boots has not submitted a response in its own name. While Kaye does run his own independent pharmacy, he is also a member of Boots\u2019s wholesaling group Alphega and in 2013 won its award for pharmacy of the year. Neither connection is mentioned in the letter. \u201cIt looks as if Boots is trying to deceive the public,\u201d said John Murphy, general secretary at the trade union, the Pharmacists\u2019 Defence Association. The letter \u201cappears to be part of a corporate campaign to undermine the many anguished accounts of working life at Boots, sent by pharmacists to the Guardian. Such an attack must call into question the integrity of those responsible for this letter.\u201d Other senior managers at the company appear to be changing their position on the Guardian\u2019s allegations, judging by the latest memo to staff from its chief pharmacist, Marc Donovan. Where previous letters to staff have accused the Guardian of a \u201cvery specific and strong negative agenda\u201d, this one accepts that \u201csome of its [Guardian coverage] underlying sentiments may strike a chord with you\u201d. Referring to the newspaper\u2019s evidence that NHS schemes are being milked for maximum profit by the company, Donovan writes: \u201cAll services must be delivered for the benefit of patients and not to meet a numerical cap.\u201d He also directs staff to \u201ca dedicated whistleblowing hotline\u201d, although no phone number is provided.",

      "bodyText": "The breakdown of the rig figures shows oil rigs falling by 11, gas rigs by 1 and miscellaneous rigs rising by 1 to give the total decline of 11 for the week. The total is the lowest since November 2009, as oil companies continue to be cautious despite the revival in crude in recent days, with Brent around its highest levels for the year. The Baker Hughes figures showed: Brent is currently 0.46% lower at $47.92 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The number of US oil rigs drilling has dropped for the sixth week in a row. According to data from Baker Hughes, the number of rigs dropped by 11 to 420. The strength of the yen after the Bank of Japan decided on Thursday to delay any further stimulus measures has helped push stock markets sharply lower on the last trading day of the month. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.27% or 80.51 points to 6241.89 Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 2.73% to 10,038.97 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.82% lower at 4428.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 1.98% at 18,600.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.62% lower at 9025.7 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.69% lower. Standard and Poor\u2019s has kept its UK credit rating at AAA, but with a negative outlook due to the risks of Britain leaving the European Union in what it expects to be a close referendum vote. It said: In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports. If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015. A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty. It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added: A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating. We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services. In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955. In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K. That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy. Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Recapping the month, it\u2019s been the miners that have shone as commodity prices appear to be moving away from the dark days seen at the start of the year and some stability is returning to the market. Anglo American is up 40% on the month, whilst a number of the sector peers have added 15%-20% too. The index may be comprehensively off the highs we touched just 10 days ago, but without the boost from commodity stocks, the picture for April would have looked a whole lot bleaker. A June rise in US interest rates looks a little unlikely, and not just because of the uncertain US economic data: Oil prices have flattened out, with Brent crude now up just 0.1% at $48.2 a barrel. But they are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in seven years, helped by a weaker dollar and signs of a dip in US production. The increase also came despite Opec\u2019s inability to agree a cap on output at January\u2019s levels to tackle the current supply glut. And here\u2019s a chart of the consumer sentiment index: The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment continued its slow decline in late April due to weakening expectations for future growth, although their views of current economic conditions remained positive. All of the April decline was in the Expectations component, which fell by 4.8% from one month ago and by 12.6% from a year ago and by 14.7% from its January 2015 peak. The retreat from the 2015 peaks was evident across a wide range of expectations about prospects for the national economy. The size of the decline, while troublesome, is still far short of indicating an impending recession. The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates. Overall, the data indicate that inflation-adjusted personal consumption expenditures will grow by 2.5% in 2016. US consumer confidence is at its weakest since September last year, according to a new survey. The University of Michigan consumers sentiment index has fallen from 91 in March to 89 in April, below estimates of a level of 90. More downbeat US data. The Chicago purchasing management index has come in at 50.4 in April, compared to 53.6 in the previous month and expectations of a level of 53. Philip Uglow, chief economist of compilers MNI Indicators, said: This was a disappointing start to the second quarter, with the Barometer barely above the neutral 50 mark in April. Against a backdrop of softer domestic demand and the slowdown abroad, panellists are now more worried about the impact a rate hike might have on business than they were at the same time last year. US markets have followed other global bourses lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 46 points or 0.2% in early trading. Markets remain nervous as the yen hits an 18 month high, on concerns that the Bank of Japan may hold fire on any further stimulus measures after disappointing investors at this week\u2019s meeting. With mixed performances so far from the latest company reporting season - Apple being a notable casualty - markets are looking fairly fragile again. The FTSE 100 is down 0.9% while German and French markets are both down around 2%. Stronger than expected eurozone growth figures have done little for equities, but helped push the euro higher. Opec\u2019s oil output in April rose by 170,000 barrels month on month to 32.64m barrels, according to a Reuters survey. The rise, bringing the level close to January\u2019s record high, was led by Iran, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. There were declines reported by Kuwait following a strike, Nigeria and Venezuela with Saudi Arabian output little changed from March. Opec and other producers have so far failed to agree proposals to cap output at January\u2019s levels in an effort to combat the current supply glut. Brent crude is currently up 0.4% at $48.34 a barrel, not far off the $50 a barrel level which a number of companies including BP believe will bring back some stability to the sector. Traders across Europe have given a resounding shrug to the eurozone\u2019s growth figures. All the main stock markets are down today, with the FTSE 100 shedding 56 points (0.8%). The French and German markets are both deeper in the red, losing around 1.5%. Royal Bank of Scotland are the biggest faller, down almost 5% now, after reporting a fresh heavy loss. And the tech sector is looking jittery, after billionaire investor Carl Icann revealed he had ditched his stake in Apple. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: For tech shares, April has indeed been \u2018the cruellest month\u2019, and while the sector as a whole is still up since the February lows, it looks like any further market rally for US shares may well have to contend without support from these high-growth names. Swiss bank UBS has upgraded its forecast for eurozone growth this year. It now expects the region to expand by 1.6% in 2016, up from 1.4%, following the news that growth has doubled to 0.6%. Reinhard Cluse, UBS economist explains: While temporary factors, including weather, may partly explain this outcome, today\u2019s reading nevertheless comes as a rather positive surprise when considering the difficult external environment at the beginning of the year. Today\u2019s GDP report contains less detail than usual, as Eurostat have produced it within 30 days of the quarter\u2019s end, not the usual 45 days. Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, reckons the growth rate could prove to be too optimistic, once more data comes in: \u201cThe euro zone economy was at a better shape at the beginning of this year than expected. The quarterly growth accelerated to 0.6% in the three months to March, from 0.3% in the previous quarter. Although this preliminary number might be revised down in coming months, the growth definitely surprised on the upside. Yet weakening U.S. and emerging market economies, the influx of migrants, and a possible U.K. exit from the EU are key risks to the region\u2019s economy.\u201d Bert Colijn, economist at ING, says he\u2019s \u201castonished\u201d that eurozone growth has doubled to 0.6%: The first months of the year were tumultuous with large stock market declines, growth concerns in the US, China and many emerging markets and plummeting confidence among businesses and consumers. Clearly, businesses and consumers have not acted on their gut feelings. While the US and UK are suffering from a strong dollar and a possible Brexit, the Eurozone saw a marked acceleration. This jump in eurozone growth comes at a good time, given worries over Brexit, political uncertainty in Spain, and the renewed tensions in Greece. But Alasdair Cavalla of the Centre for Economics and Business Research urges caution: This is the fastest rate of output growth since Q1 2015 for the Eurozone and its timing is propitious given the numerous sources of anxiety for the continent. However, false dawns have been common since the financial crisis and nowhere more so than in Europe. Country-level figures revealed the French economy is finally getting into gear, showing a 0.5% rise. It\u2019s taken the eurozone a long, long time to reach its pre-crisis levels again. As this chart shows, its post-Lehman recovery was knocked off course in 2011 by the debt crisis: Despite this stronger growth, the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Prices across the single currency bloc fell by 0.2% this month, Eurostat reports, having been flat in March. It\u2019s mainly due to cheap oil, with energy prices falling 8.6% compared with April 2015. Service sector prices have risen by 1%, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco costs 0.8% more and industrial goods prices are up 0.5%. In another boost, unemployment across the euro area has hit a new four and a half-year low. The eurozone unemployment rate dropped to 10.2% in March, down from 10.4% in February, and the lowest recorded since August 2011. Unemploment across the wider EU dropped to 8.8%, a near seven-year low. Here\u2019s some detail: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in March 2016 were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%) and Germany (4.2%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.4% in January 2016) and Spain (20.4%). Unemployment has fallen in 25 European countries in the last year, but rose in Finland and Austria. This suggests that the European recovery is finally gaining traction. However, there is a lot of catching up to do - in America, the jobless rate is 5% The eurozone has finally recovered all the economic output lost when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest financial crisis in generations. But it\u2019s been a bumpy ride, and Spain and Italy have yet to reach this milestone: This is the strongest eurozone growth rate in a year. The wider EU expanded by 0.5% during the last quarter. The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the first three months of 2016. That\u2019s twice as strong as in the previous three months, and much stronger than expect. Better-than-expected growth in France and Spain helped the eurozone to beat forecasts, and grow faster than the UK (which expanded by 0.4% last quarter). Advertising giant WPP has thrown more fuel on the fire of excessive pay, by handing its boss, Sir Martin Sorrell, a pay packet of almost \u00a371m. Over \u00a362m of the remuneration package comes from WPP\u2019s long-term incentive plan, but Sorrell is also getting \u00a37.6m in base salary, short-term bonuses and other rewards. Sorrell has built WPP into a global titan over several decades, so deserves a lot of credit for the company\u2019s success. But still, expect some criticism - this is the second biggest payday for a UK boss ever. More encouraging news: Italy\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate in over three years. Figures just released show that the Italian jobless rate dipped to 11.4% in March, from 11.6% percent in February. Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Natixis Asset Management, also believes the rise in French growth will help Francois Hollande: Waechter says (via the FT): \u201cThere is a stronger situation in the labour market and that will create strong momentum this year... It\u2019s perfect timing for Hollande.\u201d The acceleration in French growth to 0.5% is good news for Francois Hollande, the embattled president. And finance minister Michel Sapin has declared that the government\u2019s economic plans are paying off. saying: \u201cThis is solid growth. Output is increasing and translating into more jobs and a drop in unemployment.\u201d On Wednesday, France posted its biggest fall in unemployment in 15 years, after hitting a string of record highs. Shares in airlines group IAG have dropped by over 4% this morning after it warned that March\u2019s Brussels terror attacks have hit sales. IAG, which owns British Airways, is cutting back its growth plans after seeing weaker demand from high-margin business-travellers. The eurozone may have grown faster than expected in the last quarter. Economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. But with France and Spain both beating expectations (and Germany not reporting GDP yet), we might get a higher number in 90 minutes time.... Spain has racked up another quarter of strong economic growth, despite the political turmoil that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP rose by 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, matching the previous three months. Its economy has now been growing for almost three years: That\u2019s slightly faster than the 0.7% which economists had expected, suggesting that Spain shrugged off the deadlock since last December\u2019s inconclusive election. Breaking: Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That beats the 0.3% growth reported in the October-December quarter, and is the best result in more than two years. Reuters has more details: Exports rose 0.8%, up from 0.7% in Q4 2015 Imports increased 0.9%, down from 1.1% quarter. Gross investment rose 1.0%, household consumption grew 0.2% state consumption was up 0.3%. The oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. Brent crude is now trading at $48.30 per barrel, up 0.3% this morning. Three months ago, it was changing hands at just $28 per barrel, dragged down by oversupply fears and the weakening global economy. European stock markets are expected to fall this morning, despite France\u2019s better-than-expected growth figures. Investors are jittery following a late selloff on Wall Street last night (the Dow Jones fell 1%). There have been fresh losses in Asia overnight too. Disappointingly, Germany isn\u2019t reporting its growth figures this morning. Instead, it has just released some alarmingly weak consumer spending figures. Retail sales slumped by 1.1% in March, compared to February, which is the biggest monthly fall in 18 months. Economists had expected growth of 0.4% It could be a sign that Germany\u2019s domestic economy is weakening, adding to concerns that its exporters will suffer from the global slowdown. More reaction to France\u2019s growth figures: This chart confirms that domestic spending (in red) drove the French economy forwards in the last quarter: GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) - a measure of business investment, also rose. Trade had a negative impact on growth, though; imports rose by 0.5% while exports fell by 0.2%. Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss-bank Pictet agrees that the French growth figures are encouraging: France\u2019s strong performance means the eurozone may economy finally have recovered all the damage caused in the financial crisis. The French economy has smashed expectations, by growing by 0.5% in the last quarter. That\u2019s the best quarterly growth rate in a year, up from just 0.3% in October-December. It suggests France is recovering from the trauma of November\u2019s terrorist attacks. INSEE, the French stats body, reports that French household spending is \u201crecovering strongly\u201d, rising to 1.2% from -0.1% three months ago. Capital expenditure rose to 0.9%, from 0.7%, suggesting companies are a little more confident. In short, a good start to Eurozone GDP day.... Reaction to follow... Good morning. We\u2019re about to get a major healthcheck on the European economy. For starters, it\u2019s Eurozone GDP day, when a swathe of European countries report their growth figures for the last quarter. Economists predict that the single currency region may have expanded by 0.4% in January to March, up from 0.3% in the previous quarter. That would match Britain\u2019s performance, and comfortably beat the US (which expanded by a mere 0.13% in the last quarter). But it still wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to create the millions of extra jobs Europe needs. On top of that, we\u2019re also getting new inflation and unemployment figures, so it\u2019s going to be busy..... Here\u2019s how the morning might unfold (all times provisional) France GDP: 6.30am BST / 7.30am CEST Spain GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST Austria GDP: 8am BST / 10am CEST The eurozone GDP: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone inflation for April: 10am BST / 11am CEST Eurozone unemployment for March: 10am BST / 11am CEST",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In our opinion, the possibility that the U.K. could leave the European Union (EU) as a consequence of a planned \u201cleave or remain\u201d referendum set for June 23, 2016, represents a significant risk to the U.K. economy, in particular to its large financial services sector and exports.</p> <p>If the U.K. were to leave the EU, it may make financing its twin deficits more difficult, particularly its large current account deficit, which stood at 5.2% in 2015.</p> <p>A vote to leave would also likely lead to demands for another referendum on Scottish independence, leading to further uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the negative outlook reflected the possibility of at least a one in three chance of a downgrade over the next two years. It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A vote to leave is likely to hurt confidence, investment, and GDP growth, and is likely to have a negative effect on public finances. As a consequence, a U.K. departure from the EU (or \u201cBrexit\u201d) would likely lead us to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating.</p> <p>We believe that, having left the EU (the destination for about 44% of U.K. goods and services exports), the U.K. would largely lose its capacity to influence the EU\u2019s policies for key sectors, including financial services.</p> <p>In our opinion, the loss of the U.K.\u2019s EU membership could also put at risk important external financing sources for the U.K.\u2019s large current account deficit. The U.K.\u2019s current account deficit stood at 5.2% of GDP in 2015 (the highest in several decades), down only slightly from the 2014 figure of 5.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the deficit stood at an annualized 7% of GDP, the largest deficit since quarterly records began in 1955.</p> <p>In a worst-case scenario, a Brexit could also diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency, which has been a significant support for our \u2018AAA\u2019 rating on the U.K.</p> <p>That said, our affirmation of the rating reflects our assumption that, by a small majority, the referendum will deliver a vote to remain in the EU, as well as our opinion that the U.K. benefits from its large, diversified, and open economy, exhibits high labor- and product-market flexibility, and enjoys credible monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T16:16:17.582Z\">at 5.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57237de2e4b02046f02ec0d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T15:30:10.341Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commodity stocks have been some of the main gainers in the past month.

The decline is all the more remarkable given that consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions, including their personal finance, have remained largely unchanged at very positive levels during the past year. This divergence may reflect the strength of the consumer relative to the business sectors, and may have been exacerbated by growing uncertainty about the economic policies advocated by various presidential candidates.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed that Swiss authorities are scrutinising its Coutts subsidiary as it reported a near \u00a31bn loss for the first three months of 2016. RBS said the Swiss regulator, the Swiss financial market supervisory authority (Finma), had \u201copened enforcement proceedings against Coutts &amp; Co Ltd (Coutts), a member of the RBS Group incorporated in Switzerland, with regard to certain client accounts held with Coutts\u201d. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said it related to \u201cthe international private bank that we no longer own\u201d and did not elaborate. While the bank reported a statutory \u00a3421m profit for the first quarter of 2016, a \u00a31.2bn payment to the government meant that shareholders would see a \u00a3968m loss. A \u00a3226m charge was taken for the sale of a shipping portfolio. The loss, and problems selling off its Williams &amp; Glyn network to comply with a demand from the European Union, have raised questions about the prospects of RBS paying dividends to shareholders before 2018 \u2013 in turn impeding the government\u2019s ability to sell off any more of its 73% stake. Its shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 on Friday, down 6% to 230p, following dismay that the bank would not be able to pay dividends to shareholders until it had found a solution to the disposal of the W&amp;G network. On Thursday, RBS had admitted it was running the risk of missing a deadline of 2017 to carved out this branch network, a move demanded by the EU at the time of its \u00a345bn bailout. Analysts lined up to express concern about the delay, which Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, described as \u201cfarcical\u201d. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stock markets Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe delay of the spin-off kicks dividend payments into the long grass, and probably means investors will have endured a decade-long dividend drought before the bank starts making payments again.\u201d Despite warnings from analysts that the W&amp;G delay questions the management of the bank,McEwan said the team was \u201cdelivering on everything within our gift\u201d. McEwan continued to caution about the expected penalty from US authorities for the way it sold mortgage bonds \u2013 the so-called residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) \u2013 in the run up to the crisis. Analysts have calculated that this could amount to \u00a38bn, although the bank could begin talks with individual states to try to reach settlements. RBS, like other banks, also admitted it been asked by the Financial Conduct Authority for any links to the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d, the leak of 11.5m documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. RBS has amassed \u00a350bn of losses since the 2008 bailout. McEwan would not predict whether he expected the bank to make a profit for 2016 but said the bank was generating income of \u00a31bn a quarter. He has reined in the bank\u2019s global ambitions and is shrinking operations to 13 countries, from the more than 50 during the Fred Goodwin era. As part of this, one of its main offices in London \u2013 135 Bishopsgate, home to its investment banking operation \u2013 will be shut down, although this will leave two other premises in the Liverpool Street area of the City.",

      "bodyText": "An antiseptic gel to help prevent umbilical cord infections in newborn babies, which was developed from a mouthwash, has been given the green light by European regulators. GlaxoSmithKline developed the product, called Umbipro, with the charity Save the Children for use in developing countries. The gel will be sold at a not-for-profit price and could save 422,000 lives over five years, according to UN estimates. Scientists reformulated the chlorhexidine solution found in its Corsodyl mouthwash into a gel that can be applied to newly cut umbilical cords. There is a greater risk of infection \u2013 a major cause of newborn deaths \u2013 in developing countries across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where more births happen at home and unsterile materials such as dung and ash are traditionally used on the umbilical cord stump. The antiseptic gel was endorsed by the European Medicines Agency on Friday, an important step in getting it to developing countries. It will need to be approved by local regulators. GSK said it would submit applications in countries with moderate to high neonatal mortality rates. Once approved, the company plans to initially produce about 6m units, packaged in single-use foil sachets that can be opened without scissors. The UK drugmaker said it would also share its manufacturing knowledge with other companies interested in making the gel. Patrick Vallance, who runs GSK\u2019s pharmaceuticals research and development department, said the gel proved the value of collaboration between makers of pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter healthcare products such as toothpaste and mouthwash. The idea for the gel was triggered by a UN commission report in 2012 that identified chlorhexidine as an overlooked treatment which could potentially save 422,000 neonatal lives over five years.",

His body remains trapped under the rubble, which rescue workers have said is too unstable to search and engineers have said could collapse at any time. RWE npower said it would ensure the debris from the blast would not fall on to the rubble from the previous collapse.

The body of Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was recovered.

After the collapse, sniffer dogs, listening devices and drones were used to inspect the wreckage in an overnight rescue operation involving more than 100 people. Initial recovery efforts were hampered because engineers had said the building was unsafe. In early March, officials said it could be \u201cmany months\u201d before the bodies of the missing men were recovered.

      "bodyText": "The company behind the restaurant chains Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, Chiquito and Garfunkel\u2019s has warned of a decline in annual profits after it was hit by falling customer numbers in retail parks \u2013 the first profit drop in more than a decade. The Restaurant Group\u2019s woes have worsened since the turn of the year, with like-for-like sales down 2.7% in the 17 weeks to 24 April. The company, which has more than 500 restaurants, now expects sales to be down by between 2.5% and 5% this year. It would translate into a profit before tax of \u00a374m to \u00a380m, down from nearly \u00a387m in 2015. The last time the firm suffered a fall in annual profits was in the early 2000s. It also announced the departure of its chief financial officer, Stephen Critoph, who will leave after 11 years at the business. The Restaurant Group said customers had become more wary about spending money and, due to the growing popularity of online shopping, fewer people were visiting retail parks, where nearly 40% of Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s restaurants are located. Competition from rival restaurant chains had also increased, it said. Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s has been worst hit, with pub restaurants and concessions at UK airports doing well. The group said it would review its strategy, including its property portfolio, new openings, brands and costs, and will announce the outcome in August alongside its first-half results. The company has already scaled back new openings to just over 30 this year, from 44 last year. It also hopes new menus will pull in more customers. It has introduced a new breakfast menu and an app at Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, a street food section on the Chiquito menu and fresher and lighter options at its Coast to Coast chain. To mitigate the impact of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, it is looking at implementing better rostering and \u201cimproved labour productivity\u201d. Ali Naqvi, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cThe review is unlikely to find any silver bullets in the short term but shows management focusing on fixing the existing estate rather than rolling out new sites.\u201d Wyn Ellis, at Numis, said: \u201cThe current priority for management is to reduce exposure to retail-only outlets and the Frankie\u2019s brand. Over 50% of the portfolio is Frankie\u2019s and the aim is to reduce this, over time, to 40% to better balance the portfolio \u2013 with greater focus on other brands, pubs and concessions. At Frankie\u2019s the management is being refreshed, menus updated, digital marketing increased and covers in busier cinema sites increased by trimming bar space.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of 2016, but inflation in the single currency bloc has fallen back into negative territory, putting more pressure on the European Central Bank to keep deflation at bay. Official statistics showed GDP in the 19-nation eurozone rose 0.6% in the first quarter despite a backdrop of turmoil on global markets at the start of the year. It was the fastest growth for a year and twice the pace recorded in the closing quarter of 2015. GDP was up 1.6% on a year earlier. The quarterly performance beat growth in the UK, which reported a slowdown to 0.4% GDP expansion earlier this week and also outperformed the world\u2019s biggest economy, the US. The eurozone reading was better than economists had been expecting, with a Reuters poll before the release pointing to 0.4% growth. But some experts warned that the single currency region could have a tougher second quarter and that the first quarter figures could yet be revised lower when more information comes in. Other data from EU statistics office Eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone dropped to -0.2% in April, compared with zero inflation in March. The early estimate for April showed energy prices were the biggest drag on inflation, falling by an estimated 8.6% on the year. The April reading marks the second dip below zero for eurozone inflation this year and follows a warning last week from ECB chief Mario Draghi that inflation could turn negative again in coming months. The ECB has been criticised by Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who claimed record low interest rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners and risked fuelling the rise of anti-EU sentiment in Germany. But Draghi has sought to stress that loose policy was needed to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s target of \u201cbelow but close to\u201d 2%. Policymakers will take some comfort from the GDP figures, however. The pick-up in growth for the eurozone region follows news earlier on Friday that the French economy expanded a faster-than-expected 0.5% in the first quarter on the back of a big jump in consumer spending. The first quarter performance marked the fastest growth for a year and compared with 0.3% in the previous three months. Austria\u2019s economy also beat market forecasts with first quarter growth of 0.4% and Spain grew a solid 0.8%, matching the previous three months. Separate Eurostat figures showed unemployment in the eurozone fell to 10.2% in March from 10.4% in February. There were parallels between the lower unemployment rates and faster GDP growth for the eurozone, said Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING bank. \u201cDomestic strength in the eurozone economy is key to current economic growth. This is mostly because of improvements in the job market. In March, unemployment declined by more than 200,000 people in the eurozone,\u201d said Colijn. But he added a word of warning about the GDP figures: \u201cAlthough this release is certainly encouraging, it remains to be seen whether this figure is not subject to substantial revision.\u201d Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said improved eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016 was likely underpinned by decent consumer spending while the evidence from France and Austria indicated that business investment was healthy. German GDP figures are yet to come, but the region\u2019s biggest economy was likely to have put in a strong performance, said Archer. \u201cWe suspect first quarter eurozone GDP growth was also lifted appreciably by markedly increased expansion in Germany \u2013 indeed, it could well have doubled \u2013 while we also expect there to have been modest improvement in growth in Italy,\u201d said Archer. \u201cThe ECB will certainly be encouraged by the marked first quarter pick-up in eurozone GDP growth and will no doubt argue that it shows its monetary policy is working. The improvement \u2026 also reinforces belief that the ECB will remain in \u2018wait and see\u2019 mode for the next few months despite the eurozone seeing renewed deflation of 0.2% in April.\u201d But Alasdair Cavalla, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, warned against reading too much into one quarter\u2019s GDP figures. \u201cThis is the fastest rate of output growth since the first quarter of 2015 for the eurozone and its timing is propitious given the numerous sources of anxiety for the continent. However, false dawns have been common since the financial crisis and nowhere more so than in Europe,\u201d said Cavalla.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "IAG, the owner of British Airways, has said it will offer fewer seats than planned on its aircraft because demand has weakened following the Brussels attacks. The airline group was the biggest FTSE 100 faller in Friday morning trading after it said the bombings in March at Brussels airport and on the city\u2019s metro system had hit ticket sales. Shares fell almost 5% to 526p. Willie Walsh, IAG\u2019s chief executive, said he would limit capacity-growth plans in the short term in response to the softer demand. \u201cWe are reacting fast to what we believe is a softening in some markets,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThat\u2019s a feature of our business now. We don\u2019t wait around to see what the impact is. The pattern of behaviour after the Brussels events is very similar to what we saw in the market post the attacks in Paris, however I think it went a bit deeper.\u201d IAG, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, said lower fuel prices and ongoing cost cutting contributed to a first-quarter operating profit of \u20ac155m (\u00a3121m), up from \u20ac25m in the same period last year. It beat analysts\u2019 expectations of a \u20ac145m profit. Walsh said that while January and February\u2019s revenue was in line with the trends seen in the final quarter of 2015, there was a slowdown at the end of the quarter in March. \u201cMarch revenue was affected by the timing of Easter and the Brussels terrorist attacks with the latter continuing into quarter two,\u201d he said. Weaker demand for premium travel was also evident in the second quarter so far, he added. Over the first quarter, passenger unit revenue was down 4.7%. Despite the warning on weaker demand for air travel, IAG maintained its profit forecasts for the year. \u201cIn 2016, IAG still expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015,\u201d it said. Profit increased 64% in 2015 to \u20ac1.8bn.",

      "bodyText": "Ophir Energy has lost nearly a fifth of its value after the oil and gas exploration group announced a planned partnership with America\u2019s Schlumberger was not going ahead. The two agreed terms of a deal in January to bring in Sclumberger, the world\u2019s largest oilfield services business, as a partner on its Fortuna project in Equatorial Guinea. The US group was expected to receive a 40% stake in the liquefied natural gas project, and would have reimbursed Ophir for half of its past costs. That funding was supposed to cover Ophir\u2019s capital expenditure up until the first gas sales. Now the company says: Since the 26 January announcement.... Schlumberger has satisfactorily completed its technical due diligence. However Ophir and Schlumberger have been unable to complete the transaction on the terms agreed...As such discussions between the parties have terminated. The project still represents a technically and financially attractive project for Ophir and its shareholders... Ophir has remained in active discussions with a number of other parties.. these discussions include upstream equity participation, vendor financing and pre-sales of gas. Ophir said it would now take extra time to reach deals with other potential partners, and it would delay any investment decision from the middle of this year to the fourth quarter. It now expects to see the first gas produced by early 2020. The company\u2019s shares are currently down 18% at 75.1p having fallen as low as 68.81p. Stifel analyst Dragan Trajkov issued a sell note and said: We see the termination of the Schlumberger agreement as negative for the shares. As background, according to the non-binding agreement signed in January, Ophir was supposed to sell 40% (half of its interest in the project) for a capex carry equating roughly to Ophir\u2019s past costs, likely around $300m. In our view, today\u2019s announcement takes away the \u2018stamp of approval\u2019 from a major industry player (especially that it was after due diligence being done) and once again puts a question mark on the read-through value of the project. In our view, the news also gives ammunition to the \u2018doubters club\u2019. While the company has significantly lowered estimated capex to first gas, we would not be surprised if the market treats this with some scepticism, given that such progress would make project economics better and thus the Schlumberger pull out more questionable. Liberum also recommended investors to sell: This raises questions about how Ophir will finance the project...Ophir was pleased to bring Schlumberger into the Fortuna FLNG project. Ophir\u2019s cost to first gas looked fully funded by the transaction and it will now evaluate the other funding and offtake proposals that it has received. We ascribe limited value to Fortuna in our 80p valuation.",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca is ramping up its focus on cancer treatments and cutting costs to stem a slide in profits caused by expiring patents. Britain\u2019s second largest drugmaker reported a 5% rise in revenues at constant exchange rates to \u00a36.1bn in the first three months of the year, ahead of its annual meeting. However, revenues were only up 1% at actual exchange rates and core operating profit fell 12% to \u00a31.6bn, partly due to a 15% rise in research and development spending following a series of acquisitions. AstraZeneca is focusing on six areas \u2013 respiratory, diabetes, the heart drug Brilinta, emerging markets, Japan and cancer \u2013 as it works on new treatments to replace lost revenues from blockbuster drugs that come off patent. Its bestselling cholesterol pill Crestor faces generic competition in the US from next week. The chief executive, Pascal Soriot, highlighted double-digit sales growth in China, a shift towards specialty care and progress with new cancer treatments, which contributed $99m (\u00a368m) of revenues in the first quarter. The firm\u2019s new lung cancer tablet Tagrisso has recently been approved by regulators in Europe and Japan, and is on track to generate annual peak sales of $3bn, he said. Another promising new treatment is Lynparza for advanced ovarian cancer, which has launched in 24 countries. Soriot is streamlining the company\u2019s sales and manufacturing operations to save $1.1bn a year, which will mean job cuts in AstraZeneca\u2019s salesforce outside Britain. He said the impact on the UK would be minimal. This will result in a $1.5bn restructuring charge this year, mainly related to redundancy and severance costs. AstraZeneca said it would plough some of the money saved into cancer treatments. It is developing several immuno-oncology drugs, which harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight tumours, but faces tough competition from rivals, notably Bristol-Myers Squibb. At its AGM in London on Friday afternoon, the drugmaker is likely to face questions from shareholders over why it has not linked the pay of its chief executive to the ambitious sales target of \u00a345bn by 2023, up from $26bn last year. Soriot announced the goal when he was fighting off a \u00a370bn takeover bid from its US rival Pfizer two years ago. Royal London Asset Management, which owns 1% of AstraZeneca\u2019s shares, has voted against Soriot\u2019s \u00a38.4m pay package for 2015. Ketan Patel of EdenTree Investment Management said: \u201cLong-term investors in AstraZeneca will be questioning the decision of management to rebuff the offer made by Pfizer in 2016 which valued the company at \u00a370bn, a long way from the current market value of \u00a350bn. The shares have fallen 12% since the start of the year on a total return basis versus the 2% return from the FTSE 100. The company is facing strong generic competition on its two flagship products \u2013 Crestor and Nexium.\u201d Shareholder advisory firm PIRC has recommended investors vote against executive pay packages at AstraZeneca and its bigger British rival GlaxoSmithKline, which is holding its AGM next week, arguing that their incentive payments are excessive. Soriot\u2019s bonus and long-term incentives amounted to 580% of salary last year and he got paid 64 times as much as the average employee, PIRC said. The variable pay of his counterpart at GSK, Sir Andrew Witty, who will stand down next year, was 460% of salary and he earned 56 times as much as the average employee at his company. AstraZeneca\u2019s remuneration committee is looking at ways to link pay more clearly to the 2023 revenue target. However, the company insists that while some shareholders would like to see a direct link between executive pay and the target, \u201cthat is not necessarily the view of the majority\u201d. The London-listed drugmaker Shire suffered a damaging investor revolt at its meeting in Dublin on Thursday when a pay vote just squeezed through with only 50.5% backing the pay package for the chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell, the longstanding chief executive of advertising company WPP, received \u00a370.4m in cash and shares last year in one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history. Estimates of his 2015 pay deal have been made since the disclosure last month that Sorrell received nearly \u00a363m in share awards.

Sorrell\u2019s pay deal \u2013 which means he has received \u00a3190m since 2009 \u2013 is being announced at a time of renewed shareholder focus on executive pay, with two FTSE 100 firms \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 receiving \u201cno\u201d votes for the pay deals. His figure for 2015 includes a \u00a347,000 allowance for accommodation when he stays in his own home in New York. Sorrell founded WPP in 1985 when he borrowed \u00a3250,000 to buy a stake in shopping basket maker Wire &amp; Plastic Products. Through a series of acquisitions it is now the world\u2019s biggest marketing and advertising group and an acquisitions machine, combining advertising agencies such as JWT and Ogilvy &amp; Mather with PR companies including Finsbury and Hill &amp; Knowlton. Robert Quarta, WPP\u2019s chairman, tackled the issue of when Sorrell, 71, might step aside. \u201cAt some point we all leave our jobs. The question is when. Whether, in Sir Martin\u2019s case, that happens tomorrow, in one, two, three, four or five years, or even over a longer period, we have already begun to identify internal and external candidates who should be considered. \u201cSince joining your board, I have seen firsthand a rigorous and comprehensive process, where independent members of the board and the chairman regularly meet not just those who report directly to Sir Martin, but also the senior tier below,\u201d said Quarta, in his first report to shareholders since becoming chairman. \u201cShare owners should have no doubt that we already have a strong pool of internal and external candidates to draw from,\u201d said Quarta. Sorrell\u2019s pay is based on share awards dating back to 2010 when the share price was 644p. Since then the shares have risen to more than \u00a315. Sorrell\u2019s total pay is 1,444 the average of the 124,930 employed by WPP. His salary is 31 times the average. Sorrell payouts derive from a scheme known as the Leap \u2013 the leadership equity acquisition plan - will has only one more year to run after a shareholder revolt in 2012 replaced it with a new scheme, called the executive performance share plan. At current share prices, the shares locked inside the Leap are worth more than \u00a320m.",

Myners, who fought off Green\u2019s bid for Marks &amp; Spencer more than a decade ago, voiced strong criticism of the billionaire former boss of BHS, the retailer\u2019s pensions trustees and the pensions regulator on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday. \u201cWhen Philip Green took money out of the company, he weakened the company and therefore weakened its ability to meet the pensions promise,\u201d Myners said. \u201cThe pensions regulator, and the pensions trustees, have to constantly say to themselves: \u2018Is the owner in a position to continue to meet the obligations?\u2019 \u201cIf you have a company that is losing market share, losing profitability, heavily indebted \u2013 as BHS was under Philip Green\u2019s ownership \u2013 then the trustees should make sure there was sufficient money in the pensions scheme and they clearly failed to do that.\u201d Myners, a former City minister in Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government, was the bitter adversary of Green as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer between 2004 and 2006 when the former BHS owner attempted a \u00a310bn takeover. He spoke to the Today programme after filing 11 questions in the House of Lords calling on the government to investigate the BHS collapse. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 a year ago to a little-known group of investors led by formerly bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Both men are under pressure to explain how the 88-year-old high street chain fell into administration, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, and how it built up a large pension deficit after they took millions of pounds out of the company. Myners said: \u201cThe big question is whether when Philip Green sold BHS to a group of individuals with no retail experience, lead by a former mini-racing car driver and twice bankrupt person, that the pension scheme had enough assets to meet its liabilities.\u201d He said the government should fully investigate what went wrong at BHS. \u201cThe Insolvency Service should be instructed by government to look at all circumstances leading up to the collapse of BHS because there are big questions which need to be asked about the stewardship of this company under the ownership of Lady Tina Green and the management of Sir Philip Green.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Worries about the EU referendum in June and over a resurgence of the eurozone crisis have knocked consumer confidence in the UK to its lowest level in more than a year, according to a report. Market research firm GfK said its consumer sentiment indicator for April was the weakest for 15 months as households became gloomier about the UK\u2019s economic outlook. The index dropped to -3 from a March reading of 0, when GfK also claimed referendum jitters had hit consumer confidence. The latest survey of 2,000 people conducted in the first two weeks of April showed confidence dropped in all the areas measured: their personal financial situation, their view of the UK economy and whether now was a good time to make big purchases. The report\u2019s compilers linked the gloomier picture to discussions around how the UK economy would fare outside the EU in the event of a vote to leave. They also cited renewed signs of political and financial turmoil in the eurozone over Greece\u2019s troubled bailout programme. \u201cMixed messages about a post-Brexit world and the ongoing eurozone crisis are casting a cloud over our economy,\u201d said Joe Staton of GfK. \u201cThe biggest dent to confidence comes from consumers\u2019 depression [concerns] about the general economic situation in the UK for the next year, dropping 20 points in 12 months.

Official figures this week showed GDP growth dropped to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016 from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. The Bank of England recently predicted that economic growth could slow further in the coming months as companies defer spending until after the 23 June vote. Business surveys have pointed to companies holding off on investment and hiring decisions, but it has been less clear what impact, if any, the referendum was having on consumer spending. The chancellor, George Osborne, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, has sought to persuade voters to back him by using figures from a Treasury analysis to claim every household would be thousands of pounds worse off if Britain left. But backers of a vote to the leave have rejected the figures and accused the Treasury of failing to account for savings from lower regulation if Britain were to leave the EU.
