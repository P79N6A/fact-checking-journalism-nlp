    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House prices in Cambridge have risen more than any other British town or city over the past seven years. They are now a third higher than their previous peak in 2007 and have increased by an average of \u00a353,000 over the past year alone. The university city is one of eight locations where prices have surpassed their previous record highs, analysis by property firm Hometrack has found. All are in the south of England except Aberdeen, where prices have been driven up by the booming oil industry. At the other end of the scale, homes in Belfast are still fetching only half the amount they did before the crash, according to the report, which underlines the huge differences in the UK market. Hometrack\u2019s first UK cities house price index looked at the Land Registry\u2019s prices-paid data for 20 urban areas that account for 9.8m homes out of Britain\u2019s total stock of 27m. In all those areas, house prices have increased over the past year, although in one \u2013 Aberdeen \u2013 the rate of growth has now plateaued. While Cambridge recorded the biggest bounce-back since the downturn, with the average price now standing at \u00a3348,300, London was not far behind, with values now 29% above their previous peak. In the past 12 months, prices in the capital have risen by more than \u00a360,000 to an average of \u00a3398,700, Hometrack said. Third on the list was another hotbed of academia, Oxford, where homes are typically changing hands for 21% more than in 2007, at \u00a3337,400. In contrast, the index shows that Belfast has the furthest to go in recovering from the crash, with prices in the city still 51% lower than in 2007, at an average of \u00a3113,500. In Liverpool and Glasgow, the report says, prices are still 15% below their peak, while in Leeds there is still a double-digit gap, with prices down 10%. Ed Meyer, head of residential sales at Savills in Cambridge, said the area he covers did not fall far during the downturn. \u201cThere was a blip, there was a slowdown, but we came back at the beginning of the next year and the phone started ringing again, and we were quickly back to best offers and sealed bids,\u201d he said. Earlier this year Cambridge was named as the fastest place to sell a home by the property website Rightmove, and Meyer said that a lack of homes for sale had been a factor in rising prices. He said the city was \u201cimproving\u201d and had much to recommend it to buyers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good schools, we\u2019ve got a good commute to London, we\u2019ve got good jobs and we\u2019ve got a very pretty city centre.\u201d In recent months, he said, the city had felt \u201ca very strong ripple\u201d from London, as homeowners in the capital cashed in and bought elsewhere. However, Hometrack\u2019s research director Richard Donnell described Belfast as \u201cthe one city that experienced a true housing boom and bust in the last cycle\u201d. He added: \u201cAt their peak, prices in Belfast were rising at 61% per annum in April 2007, supported by low mortgage rates and positive sentiment feeding across from the Republic, as well as on the back of the peace process. Demand fell over the financial crisis and average house prices bottomed out in July 2013.\u201d Since then, he said, they have increased by 10%. Hometrack said that although there had been year-on-year price increases across the 20 cities, in 14 of them rises were below the 9% UK average. \u201cExpectations that strong house price growth in the south of England would ripple out across the country were overdone,\u201d said Donnell. \u201cWhile house price growth has increased across all cities in the last year, the rate of growth in the majority of cities is below the UK average. There is little evidence of a runaway surge in prices and the rate of growth appears to be moderating.\u201d That seems to be backed up by figures from the British Bankers\u2019 Association that show the number of mortgages approved for house purchases fell to a 14-month low in September. A total of 39,271 homebuyer loans were approved over the month, down by 10% on September 2013\u2019s figure, and below the previous six-month average of 42,589. The total value of those loans was \u00a36.4bn, below the previous six-months\u2019 average of \u00a36.9bn, and the average approval value also fell, to \u00a3157,700 from \u00a3161,200 the previous month. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: \u201cA year ago there were many of us who were concerned by the heady pace of property price rises. Today\u2019s figures suggest we are now experiencing a steadier housing market, and that\u2019s no bad thing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The madness of London house prices has nothing on the madness of those investors who in February were paying 380p for shares in Foxtons, the capital-focused estate agency. It turns out they were paying about 32 times this year\u2019s earnings, ridiculous for a business whose earnings are almost guaranteed to be volatile.</p> <p>That calculation assumes Foxtons will make top-line operating profits of about \u00a347m for 2014, the average of City analysts\u2019 rapidly revised guesses after the heavy profits warning. Note, though, that Foxtons merely told shareholders to brace for less than last year\u2019s \u00a349.6m, but did not specify how much less. It could be worse than \u00a347m.</p> <p>It is clear that the London housing market has developed sudden subsidence, even if the damage is not yet obvious in actual sale prices. Foxtons says its volume of transactions in the third quarter was 15% lower than a year ago. One factor it blames is \u201cmismatches between the price expectations of buyers and sellers\u201d, an explanation that will amuse or infuriate Londoners who think Foxtons\u2019 one-trick sales pitch is a naked appeal to sellers\u2019 greed.

      "bodyText": "The madness of London house prices has nothing on the madness of those investors who in February were paying 380p for shares in Foxtons, the capital-focused estate agency. It turns out they were paying about 32 times this year\u2019s earnings, ridiculous for a business whose earnings are almost guaranteed to be volatile. That calculation assumes Foxtons will make top-line operating profits of about \u00a347m for 2014, the average of City analysts\u2019 rapidly revised guesses after the heavy profits warning. Note, though, that Foxtons merely told shareholders to brace for less than last year\u2019s \u00a349.6m, but did not specify how much less. It could be worse than \u00a347m. It is clear that the London housing market has developed sudden subsidence, even if the damage is not yet obvious in actual sale prices. Foxtons says its volume of transactions in the third quarter was 15% lower than a year ago. One factor it blames is \u201cmismatches between the price expectations of buyers and sellers\u201d, an explanation that will amuse or infuriate Londoners who think Foxtons\u2019 one-trick sales pitch is a naked appeal to sellers\u2019 greed.

Not for the first time in the recent crop of flotations, a private equity seller has enjoyed the last laugh.

      "bodyText": "Spirit Pub Company has rejected an attempt by the company behind Magners cider to gatecrash its \u00a3750m takeover by brewer Greene King. Irish cider company C&amp;C Group is understood to have made a new \u00a3760m approach for the chain of 1,200 pubs in an effort to trump Greene King\u2019s offer \u2013 which the Spirit board has indicated it is willing to recommend to shareholders. In a statement after the stock exchange had closed last night, Spirit said: \u201cThe board of Spirit confirms that it has received a preliminary approach from C&amp;C Group plc regarding a possible offer for Spirit. The board of Spirit has reviewed the proposal and rejected it.\u201d C&amp;C\u2019s shock move is thought to have been pitched at around 115p a share, with around a third of it cash and the remainder being offered in C&amp;C shares. Greene King\u2019s approach includes just 8p of cash, although it was worth 113.4p a share at last night\u2019s stock market close. Greene King also owns 1,900 pubs and restaurants and so can offer potential synergies with Spirit\u2019s estate which includes Chef &amp; Brewer, while C&amp;C is solely a drinks group. Greene King, which owns pubs and restaurants including the Loch Fyne and Hungry Horse chains as well as ales such as Old Speckled Hen, has already increased the price of its potential bid \u2013 having improved the amount it is prepared to pay on Monday, a day ahead of a takeover deadline that would have forced it to either make a formal offer or retreat. Shares in Spirit rose to 101.75p on that news, and they were struggling to get much higher than 104p on Thursday until rumours of a new suitor emerged half an hour before the stockmarket closed. The shares, which initially spiked to around 110p, closed at 106.25p \u2013 although at the time there was no clear information that C&amp;C had been rebuffed. The C&amp;C move will come as a surprise to the industry, which had viewed the likes of pub groups Marston\u2019s and Mitchells &amp; Butlers as the more likely candidates to attempt to compete with Greene King. It has also surprised City watchers, as shares in Spirit, which was split from Punch Taverns in 2011 and also owns Flaming Grill restaurants and Good Night inns, were trading at around 75p before it became a target. That share price already represented a significant improvement, as they began 2012 at just over 40p. On Wednesday, Spirit said its full-year pretax profit had grown by 11%, buoyed by strong growth in its core managed pubs division \u2013 run by landlords who work for the pub group. Greene King\u2019s business dates back to the 18th century when Benjamin Greene established a brewing business in Bury St Edmunds in 1799. C&amp;C can trace its roots back 79 years when it was founded by William Magner. It acquired the rights to Bulmers cider in Ireland in 1937 and has made numerous acquisitions since, including Scottish drinks wholesalers, Wallaces Express, and Ireland\u2019s leading drinks wholesaler and producers of Tipperary Water, Gleeson Group, during the past two years. A takeover by Greene King would leave Spirit shareholders with 29% of the combined company, although there is no certainty that a formal offer will be made. Greene King and C&amp;C did not comment.",

The Anglo-Dutch consumer products firm said the number of items sold rose 0.3% in the third quarter of this year \u2013 a sharp slowdown from 1.9% growth in each of the previous two quarters. The stagnant eurozone economy and a slowdown in China and other emerging markets have suppressed sales for the maker of brands including Dove soap, Vienetta ice cream and Lynx deodorant. Paul Polman, Unilever\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMarket growth slowed in emerging countries and particularly in China where we also experienced substantial trade de-stocking. \u201cEurope saw price deflation and poor summer weather compared with last year but conditions in north America started to improve. We expect markets to remain tough for at least the remainder of the year.\u201d Sales growth in the three months to the end of September was Unilever\u2019s weakest since late 2009 when the global economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

But, globally, most consumers across Unilever\u2019s markets are cutting spending, forcing it to respond.

Unilever\u2019s shares fell 3.7% to a seven-month low of \u00a324.40. They have dropped 10% since early September as fears have mounted about the prospects for global growth. Hu\u00ebt said the company would clamp down harder on costs after cutting 1,400 jobs this year. The firm made no indication that annual profits would fail to meet expectations. The company makes more than half its sales in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. A slowdown in developing countries helped prompt Unilever\u2019s first profit warning in years last October and many of those markets are going through a tough time again as Chinese growth slows.",

      "bodyText": "The day\u2019s big story in the UK of course has been Tesco, and after its latest update its shares have dropped 6.5% or 12p to 171p, writes Nick Fletcher. That means around \u00a3972m has been wiped off the supermarket\u2019s value today, as investors took fright at a bigger black hole than previously reported and a certain lack of strategy going forward. As a reminder, Tesco was trading at 330p at the start of the year. Overall though an opening rise on Wall Street after good results from the likes of Caterpillar and 3M helped lift European markets out of the doldrums. Poor figures from, yes, Tesco, as well as Unilever and Michelin held European markets (especially the UK0 back but the US bounce meant they still finished in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 19.42 points or 0.3% higher at 6419.15 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.2% to 9047.31 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.28% at 4157.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.88% to 19, 434.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.82% better at 10,333.7 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently a hefty 246 points or 1.49% higher, more evidence if it were needed of the current volatile state of the markets. And with that, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More bad news for Tesco (if such a thing has any impact any more). Moody\u2019s has downgraded its rating on the supermarket\u2019s long term ratings from Baa2 to Baa3. Sven Reinke, a Moody\u2019s vice president, said: We have downgraded Tesco\u2019s ratings because of the materially reduced trading profit for the first half of fiscal 2015 that is affected by the rapid structural changes in the UK retail grocery market as well as the ongoing uncertainties related to the investigation by the FCA into Tesco\u2019s accounting irregularities. Even if the FCA concludes its investigation without material negative financial implications, Tesco faces huge operational challenges which continue to put its investment grade rating at risk. Here\u2019s City analyst Louise Cooper explaining how Tesco\u2019s finances have reached the \u2018worst point\u2019 in its history Time for another catch-up: Tesco remains under pressure after announcing a 92% tumble in pre-tax profits this morning, a 4.6% drop in sales in its core UK market, and a wider-than-expected black hole in previous results (see earlier summary for details). Archie Norman has now emerged as the front-runner to replace outgoing chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, with both William Hill and Paddy Power. Not clear if the former ASDA chief, and MP for Tunbridge Wells, is up for the challenge, though. Analysts are calling for Tesco chief Dave Lewis to outline a new strategic direction for the company. Jon Copestake, Retail Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warned: If Dave Lewis wasn\u2019t considering radical action when he began in his role as CEO then he certainly will be now. And David McCarthy of HSBC warned that turning Tesco around is a huge challenge: Tesco\u2019s problems can be summed up as Tesco having lost its emotional connection with the consumer. This needs rebuilding by Tesco becoming the shopper champion and by behaving as a market leader. This will take time and money. What the analysts say Tesco has admitted that it will continue to pay former CEO Phil Clarke a salary until next January, even though these profit over-statements took place on his watch. Dave Lewis has dampened speculation that he might raise cash from shareholders, saying a rights issue is not being planned. Lewis also told reporters that Tesco is close to selling two of its corporate jets, and revealed that he has swapped his limo for a train ticket. Shares in Tesco are currently down more than 7%, wiping almost \u00a31bn off its market capitalisation. Rivals have also been hit (Morrisons has lost 3.6%, and Sainsbury\u2019s are down 2.8%). Duncan Swift, a partner at Moore Stephens LLP, says that Tesco\u2019s troubles shows how supermarkets have become so centred on forcing discounts and payments from their own suppliers: You would think the amount of price reductions that a supermarket can get through supplier contributions is going to be nothing like what we as consumers spend at the tills and relatively you are right. But in profit terms, at the margin, it\u2019s 15 times more attractive for a supermarket to get an extra \u00a31 of supplier contribution than it is to encourage the likes of you and I to spend an extra \u00a31 at the till. Here\u2019s his full explanation. Another piece of OK-ish economic news from Europe -- consumer confidence in the euro area was flat in October, having fallen for the previous four months. Tesco\u2019s rivals insist that their own accounts are fully accurate, reports Sky News\u2019s Naomi Kerbel. The \u00a3263m black hole that build up Tesco\u2019s profits has its roots in the various payments that the company would extract from its own suppliers. They include \u2018incentives\u2019 to give their products a good show on the shelves, or \u2018bonuses\u2019 when Tesco managed to shift enough of a suppliers\u2019 goods. Duncan Swift, a partner at Moore Stephens LLP, has written an explanation on how this \u2018commercial income\u2019 is now vital to supermarkets: \u201cWhat shareholders and customers of the Top 10 supermarkets do not realise is the extent of the buyer bonus culture that underpins demands for suppliers to pay commercial income. \u201cThis bonus culture is comparable to the bank bonus culture, with supermarket buyers, operating in trading rooms similar to those operated by the banks and investment companies. \u201cThe main part of a supermarket buyer\u2019s annual bonus is based on the total amount of supplier-paid commercial income they have extracted from the suppliers in the food category (e.g. eggs, cheese, fresh produce, beers, wines and spirits etc) for which they have responsibility. \u201cTesco\u2019s overstatements of profit means their buyer bonuses will have been similarly overstated and already paid over a number of years. \u201cAs with the banks, someone must ultimately pay for these bonuses and although on the face of it the supplier seems to be footing the bill, we must ask how much of this cost the consumer pays for at the checkout. \u201cIt is also important to consider the impact on the supplier\u2019s business in as much as what pressure that business is under to be able to afford to pay these supplier contributions. Also, the impact this has on the treatment of supplier staff and the quality of our food that we are paying for at the checkout.\u201d Moore Stephens calculate these financial contributions are worth several billions of pounds per year to the top ten supermarkets. As Swift explains: \u201cYou would think the amount of price reductions that a supermarket can get through supplier contributions is going to be nothing like what we as consumers spend at the tills and relatively you are right. But in profit terms, at the margin, it\u2019s 15 times more attractive for a supermarket to get an extra \u00a31 of supplier contribution than it is to encourage the likes of you and I to spend an extra \u00a31 at the till. \u201cIt is very easy for a supermarket to levy these supplier contributions directly against what they owe in debt to the supplier for goods already supplied.\u201d An analysis by Moore Stephens found that the top ten supermarkets owe suppliers approximately \u00a315bn in unpaid bills at any one time. That\u2019s a big pool of \u2018supplier debt\u2019 to dip into. Shares are rallying on Wall Street in early trading, pushing the Dow Jones index up over 200 points, or 1.2%. Caterpillar is leading the way; shares are up 3.5% after reporting solid results and raising its profit forecasts. It said there was a \u201creasonable\u201d chance that world economic growth would pick up, despite the Ukraine crisis, conflicts in the Middle East and the slower growth in China. Gloomier news from the eurozone this lunchtime. The Bank of Italy has predicted that the country\u2019s economy probably contracted slightly in the last three months. That would put Italy officially back into recession. The recovery in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector appears to have hit a road bump last month. More firms have seen falling export orders than rising ones, according to the latest survey by the CBI. And looking at the next quarter, 29% of manufacturers expect total new orders to increase, and 9% expect them to fall. That gives a balance of +20%, the lowest since October 2013. Full story: CBI warns export demand is slowing in latest sign of faltering UK recovery Some lunchtime light relief -- City AM are running an online quiz on Tesco\u2019s woes. Complete with some groan-worthy puns. I scored 4 out of 6. Over to the US briefly... and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen, by 17,000 last week to 283,000. But the underlying trend looks better -- the average initial claims figure over the last four weeks has dropped to its lowest in 14 years. The continuing claims figure (people receiving benefit for at least the second month running) also hit a 14-year low, of 2.35m. Dave Lewis has told reporters that he has ditched his corporate limo, and is using the train to travel to London from Tesco\u2019s HQ in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. We\u2019re collecting expect reaction to Tesco\u2019s results here: Tesco results: what the analysts say Tesco\u2019s shares haven\u2019t recovered their early losses -- still down around 6%. And the Evening Standard is blaming Dave Lewis, saying: The City hurled brickbats at new Tesco boss Dave Lewis today after he refused to reveal his plans to tackle the most devastating crisis in the supermarket\u2019s history and return it to growth.... Unforgiving place, the City. Lewis only started last month, and immediately found that the challenge was far worse than anyone imagined. Bookmakers have installed Archie Norman, the retail veteran who rescued Asda from collapse, as the front-runner to become Tesco\u2019s next chairman. William Hill reckons that the former Conservative MP is the best choice to rescue Tesco (as my colleague Nils Pratley suggested early this morning). Spokesman Graham Sharpe says: \u2018Tesco\u2019s catch-phrase is \u2018every little helps\u2019, and it seems they need every bit of help they can get at the moment\u2019 Here\u2019s William Hills odds: 3/1 Archie Norman 4/1 Sir Ian Cheshire 5/1 John Gildersleeve 5/1 Allan Leighton 7/1 Mike Ashley 9/1 David Tyler 9/1 Richard Cousins 10/1 Moya Greene 10/1 Adam Crozier 14/1 Robert Swannell 25/1 Glenn Murphy Paddy Power have also installed Archie Norman as the favourite (on less generous odds): 5/4 Archie Norman 5/2 John Gildersleeve 5/1 Allan Leighton 12/1 Terry Leahy 12/1 Charlie Mayfield 16/1 Mark Price Just in... Tesco is hoping to sell two of its corporate jets (!) within days. Buy one, get one free? Tesco will continue to pay former CEO Philip Clarke a salary until next January, my colleague Zoe Wood reports. As reported at 7.34am, Tesco has frozen the payoffs due to Clarke, and former finance director Laurie McIlwee. The FCA have told Tesco\u2019s chief Dave Lewis not to give details about how it overstated its profits by \u00a3263m, according to Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason. It\u2019s not been a bad morning for European economic data. Manufacturing output across the eurozone grew at a faster rate this morning, and German factories led the way. Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.8 from 49.9 in September, which shows a return to growth. And Spain\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2011. Bloomberg has a good take: Euro-Area Manufacturing Grows as Risk of Recession Eases It may only be October, but that hasn\u2019t stopped UK retailer Selfridges launching its Christmas decorations display this morning. And this year, they\u2019ve created an eye-catching montage of scenes based around fairytales. Quite impressive too. As Lisa Bachelor reports: A glittering golden spider\u2019s web fills the window of Selfridges in Oxford street,London. Hanging from its skeins are shoes with impossibly high heels, jewel-encrusted bags and a pair of designer sunglasses. At the base is a spinning wheel, its drive wheel slowing turning under the warm glow of the lights. Next to it sits a mannequin in a Simone Rocha dress, her legs crossed and a hand placed nonchalantly on one hip. Everything is spray-painted gold. This is Sleeping Beauty, Selfridges style. The window was one of the store\u2019s 25, unveiled late on Wednesday night by workmen dressed in high-visibility jackets as they peeled black sheets of vinyl to reveal the eye-catching displays. More words and photos here: Selfridges\u2019 Christmas window wonderland conjures magic of fairytales Here\u2019s our news story on the 0.3% month-on-month drop in UK retail sales in September: Retail sales fell more than expected last month as shoppers put off buying new winter clothes amid the driest September on record. Sales fell 0.3% over the month, driven down by falling sales of textiles, clothing and footwear according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as people shunned winter coats and jumpers to bask in the last of the warmer weather. Economists had forecast a smaller drop of 0.1%. \u201cFeedback from retailers suggested the fall was a result of unseasonably warm weather meaning consumers have delayed purchases of autumn and winter clothing,\u201d the ONS said. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the drop in sales was a sign that things were cooling off, but nothing sinister. \u201cThere is probably a little more cooling off to come, but it is just that \u2013 cooling off not an arctic chill.\u201d More here: Warm autumn depresses UK retail sales In other news.... it\u2019s been a bad morning for shareholders in London estate agents Foxtons. It warned that the housing market in the capital is slowing, and blamed political and economic concerns in the UK and Europe, tighter mortgage lending markets and a mismatch between price expectations of buyers and sellers. Turnover in the last quarter fell 3%, and Foxtons how expects to make fewer profits this year than last year. Shares have tumbled 15%, or 33p, to 174p. They were worth 230p when Foxtons floated on the stockmarket, a year ago. Full story: Foxtons shares slump 15% as London property slowdown hits profits Back to Tesco...and CEO Dave Lewis has just told analysts that it is not working on a rights issue* at the moment. Instead, he\u2019s planning to sell certain parts of the business to improve its balance sheet. * - in a rights issue, investors are asked to give money to the company in return for more cheap shares. If they decline, their stake is diluted. Last month\u2019s drop in retail sales shows that Britain\u2019s economy is \u201cgently\u201d slowing down, says Rob Wood, economist at Berenberg. But it\u2019s not a reason to panic: British growth is gently slowing as several domestic and external headwinds blow a bit stronger. But we are far away from the sort of drag on the UK in 2011/12 during the extreme times of Euro crisis. Falling food and petrol prices will aid consumer spending power over the next few months, as will slightly cheaper mortgage rates. We find out tomorrow how the UK economy performed in the last quarter, with the first estimate for GDP in July-September. Economists expect growth slowed to +0.7%, from +0.9% in April-June. Britain\u2019s wider retail industry is also finding life tough, according to new figures this morning. The volume of stuff bought fell by 0.3% in September, compared to August, a bigger fall than expected. The Office for National Statistics reported that textile, clothing and footwear sales slid by 7.8% during the month. Retailers blamed: unseasonably warm weather meaning consumers have delayed purchases of autumn and winter clothing. There are also signs of deflation. The amount spent on retail goods fell by 0.6% month-on-month, as shops cut prices. Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell by 1.4% in September 2014 compared with September 2013, the ONS added. Another quote from the Tesco analyst call, via Reuters: TESCO CEO SAYS DOING SOMETHING ON PRICE WHEN YOU HAVEN\u2019T GOT THE SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY PERFECT MIGHT NOT BE BEST THING So Lewis might resist a price war until he\u2019s fixed some of Tesco\u2019s structural problems.... Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, is alarmed that Tesco \u201cremains in a strategic vacuum\u201d. That, rather than the accounting scandal that has grown only slightly bigger, is likely to be shareholders\u2019 biggest worry today. How can Dave Lewis consider asking shareholders for a helping hand, through a rights issue, if he can\u2019t outline his grand turnaround plan? He can\u2019t even tell them who the next chairman will be (could retail veteran Archie Norman be lured?). Nils concludes: A new strategy has to appear as soon as possible in the new year. Christmas seems to be case of muddling through with \u201c\u00a35 off\u201d vouchers. In the circumstances, another 5% off the share price \u2013 the market\u2019s initial reaction \u2013 is entirely understandable. Errors with revenue recognition are one thing; what shareholders want now is a recognisable strategy. Here\u2019s the full piece: Tesco in crisis: where\u2019s the strategy? Tesco is now briefing City analysts -- and Louise Cooper is helpfully tweeting from the call. She\u2019s not terribly impressed: Here\u2019s our news story on the troubles at Tesco (full coverage starts at 7am) Tesco\u2019s profits black hole bigger than expected and runs back several years Tesco\u2019s failure to slow its sales decline has worried Jon Copestake, Retail Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. He says: \u201cIf Dave Lewis wasn\u2019t considering radical action when he began in his role as CEO then he certainly will be now. A 4.4% decline in like for like sales is, in many ways, more significant than the 92% decline in profits given the investment the firm has been making to halt its decline. The only good news, Copestake reckons, is that Lewis has a clean slate, with his predecessors taking the blame: If there is a silver lining for Tesco it is that Lewis will no doubt now have carte blanche in engineering a turnaround. Having fallen up to 7% in early trading, Tesco\u2019s shares have settled at around 174p, down almost 5% today. New chief executives often like to get the bad news out of the way early. Dave Lewis didn\u2019t have much choice at Tesco, given the mess he\u2019s been confronted with. But he has still managed to include various one-off costs in today\u2019s results: They include stock write-downs of \u00a363m, impairment charges of \u00a3136m in the UK and Europe, restructuring costs of \u00a341m, a \u00a341m retrospective charge relating to a Valuation Office ruling on ATM rates and an extra \u00a327m set aside to cover compensation to Tesco Bank customers who were missold PPI products. But, as Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says: \u201cEven after this classic example of kitchen sinking, it remains impossible to gauge whether today is Tesco\u2019s nadir.\u201d Mike Dennis of Cantor Index says Tesco\u2019s management must focus on UK trading ahead of the important Christmas period, to make sure it has enough stock and promotions. CEO Dave Lewis must then: ...simplify the business via UK and International asset sales, then reconnect with suppliers by changing payment terms and lowering his cost of goods and then start on the long road to rebuilding the Tesco brand with shoppers. City traders are aghast that Tesco\u2019s statutory pre-tax profits have slumped by 92% so far this year (see chart here) James Abbott of Accendo Markets says: Supermarket giant Tesco has yet again not failed to disappoint loyal investors this morning. A record 92% decline in pre-tax profits in the first half of the year and a fall in organic British sales described as the worst performance in 40 years does not sit well with traders across the City! Blackrock has publicly been dumping the stock, Warren Buffett announced his investment was a \u2018huge mistake\u2019 and a further \u00a313m on top of the \u00a3250m accounting black whole sees the shares back around multi-year lows! Why would anyone take a risk on a company that continues to disappoint in this manner? Fortune often favours the brave, but the stupid? Julie Palmer, retail expert at Begbies Traynor, warns that Dave Lewis may be running out of time: What shareholders will want to know is why the supermarket chain has been so slow to respond to the seismic changes in consumer buying behaviour, when rivals like Asda and Morrison\u2019s already made swift changes, and whether it has the management bandwidth to continue that improvement as we move into the important pre-Christmas trading period. CEO Dave Lewis will now be concentrating on a strategy that can compete with Aldi and Lidl\u2019s unwavering success whilst also addressing the shift in consumer demand from supermarket to convenience shopping. The question is, will it be too little too late for what was once Britain\u2019s favourite supermarket\u201d Analysts at Shore Capital say they simply cannot remember a worse period in Tesco\u2019s history than the last six months: Tesco has had quite a few years of challenge and disappointment. However, we can never recall a period so damaging to the reputation of the company as H1 FY2015. That a powerhouse of international retailing was reduced to a rudder less corporate entity where downgrade followed downgrade, executive followed executive out of the business, with no effective succession planning, capped by a material accounting issue, reflects to a detrimental extent, to our minds, upon those who are the guardians of Tesco on behalf of its owners. They add that shareholders will be pleased to see the chairman stepping down. But they are also concerned that Tesco wasn\u2019t able to full year profit guidance. As such there is a further risk of earnings downgrades to our minds with management demonstrably signalling that customers must come first. Phil Dorrell, director of Retail Remedy, has welcomed Sir Richard Broadbent\u2019s decision to step aside soon: \u201cSir Richard Broadbent\u2019s decision to fall on his sword was, on balance, the right one. Unlike Dave Lewis, he has been there throughout. \u201cTesco needs a clean break from this sorry saga and, through Sir Richard Broadbent\u2019s departure, will have the best chance of achieving it. Tesco\u2019s shares have now fallen by 48% so far this year, a staggering tumble for one of Britain\u2019s major companies. Its value has fallen to around \u00a314.2bn, from almost \u00a330bn in January. The rise and fall of Tesco, through its share price: Dave Lewis needs to decide on his turnaround strategy for Tesco, and fast, says Josh Raymond of City Index. Raymond says that \u201cthe lack of clarity in strategy and direction\u201d is the most worrying aspect of today\u2019s news. Dave Lewis is Tesco\u2019s new CEO. He simply HAS to show his strength of leadership to steer Tesco through its worst crisis in decades. His failure to provide a detailed strategic direction for the firm at this stage will only deepen shareholder fears and cloud the markets view of how and when Tesco can bounce back. The fact the firm is unable to tell the market what it thinks it will report for a full year is perhaps the biggest worry. Either it\u2019s own full year projection is too terrible to state (does not make sense as surely you would want all the bad news out at once) or it simply has no idea how it could perform (equally troubling!). Today\u2019s statement contains little guidance on how Lewis will turn Tesco around. OK, he\u2019s only been there 55 days, but the former Unilever executive simply doesn\u2019t have time to spare. As retail analyst Nick Bubb puts it: It would be nice to know exactly what Tesco\u2019s strategic priorities are, with today\u2019s results largely focused on the problems of the past. Tesco has helped to drag the FTSE 100 index of bluechip shares down by 1.1%, or 70 points, to 6327. Only three shares are up (Glaxo, Royal Mail and Severn Trent) Scrap that idea that Tesco\u2019s share might rise -- they are tumbling in early trading, down 6.5% to 171p. So to quickly recap: Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket has confirmed that it overstated its profits by \u00a3263m, going back at least two years. That\u2019s \u00a313m than first thought. An investigation by Deloitte has confirmed that earnings were booked early, and costs delayed, to improve Tesco\u2019s figures. And that the practice snowballed, as those responsible had to pull forward more and more revenue to keep the numbers looking good. The company\u2019s under-fire chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, is to step down once CEO Dave Lewis and his team are up and running. Tesco is withholding the payouts due to Lewis\u2019s predecessor Phil Clarke, and FD Laurie McIlwee, while the Financial Conduct Authority investigates the issue. Tesco has scrapped its profit guidance for this financial year, and admitted that profits could suffer as Lewis tries to restore its fortunes. As Lewis put it: \u201cOur business is operating in challenging times. Trading conditions are tough and our underlying profitability is under pressure.\u201d The company is clearly struggling -- UK like-for-like sales are down by 4.6% in the first half of this year, trading profits are down by 40%, and pre-tax profits have tumbled by 92%. Joshua Raymond of City Index isn\u2019t impressed by Tesco\u2019s performance so far this year -- with trading profits down 40% and UK like-for-like sales down 4.6%, Dharshini David of Sky News points out that profits also fell at its operations in Asia (which could be sold to raise funds): Joseph Cotterill of the FT flags up some good news -- Tesco has avoided the humiliation of restating historic financial results. Tesco\u2019s shares are expected to rise around 3% when the London stock market opens in 20 minutes: That may reflect relief that Deloitte didn\u2019t discover any more nasties lurking in the Tesco accounts..... Dave Lewis is now explaining that there is no evidence that the misreporting was done for \u201cpersonal gain\u201d. He\u2019s arguing that bonuses weren\u2019t paid during the three years under this review, so executives didn\u2019t benefit directly. Big news: Tesco reveals that it is holding back the payoffs that were due to be handed to former CEO Philip Clarke, and finance director Laurie McIlwee. The money is frozen while the City watchdog investigates the issue. Clarke, who resigned this summer, was due to walk away with a \u00a310m payoff. The news this morning that Tesco overstated its profits in previous financial years, as well as this year, puts more pressure on both men. Tesco is holding a conference call with reporters now.... Another sign that all isn\u2019t well at Tesco -- the company has just scrapped its outlook for profits in this financial year. The company says that its relative performance simply wasn\u2019t competitive enough in the first half of the year. And it warns that full year profitability could be \u201cfurther impacted\u201d by actions we choose to take. As such, there are a number of uncertainties which limit visibility of future performance. We will do the right thing for customers - and therefore the business - despite these uncertainties. For these reasons we are not providing full year profit guidance. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, says Tesco is operating in \u201ctough trading conditions\u201d, adding: I have been heartened by the team\u2019s welcome and their determination to stay focused on doing the very best for our customers. Tesco called Deloitte in last month after a whistleblower flagged up that the company had been overstating its profits (mainly, we think, by mis-reporting revenues and costs related to suppliers) The investigators have concluded that: our overall commercial income adjustment in the current reporting period of \u00a3263m is reasonable; amounts have been pulled forward or deferred, contrary to Tesco Group accounting policies; there have been similar practices in prior reporting periods; the current and prior practices appear to be linked as income pulled forward grew period by period. This chart shows underlying profits at Tesco have almost halved in the first half of this financial year (from March to August). And statutory pre-tax earnings are down a staggering 92%! Tesco is looking for a new chairman. Sir Richard Broadbent, who has been criticised for allowing Tesco to run without a full-time finance director, has announced that is \u201cpreparing the ground\u201d to step aside. Stability and orderly process are now of primary importance to the company. The Board\u2019s immediate focus must be on ensuring that we complete the transition to a new management team and that new and far-reaching business plans are put in place quickly. These plans will mark the beginning of a new phase for the company and I will begin now to prepare the ground to ensure an orderly process for my own succession at that time. My decision reflects the important principle of accountability on behalf of the Board and will support the company to draw a line under the past as it enters the next phase of its development. It also appears that the problems with Tesco\u2019s financial reporting predate this financial year. It says that around \u00a3118m of the profit overstatement relates to the first half of this financial year. A further \u00a370m relates to the 2013/14 financial year. And an extra \u00a375m relates to \u201cpre-2013/14\u201d. Today\u2019s results show that Tesco continues to struggle -- like-for-like sales excluding VAT and petrol in the UK fell by 5.5% in the second quarter. Breaking: Tesco\u2019s delayed results have just been released. And the supermarket says that the investigation launched by Deloitte has found that its profits in the first half of the year were overstated by \u00a3263m. That\u2019s bigger than the \u00a3250m which it initially estimated. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. The big story of the morning will be Tesco, which is releasing its delayed financial results, a month after shocking the City by revealing that it had overstated its results by \u00a3250m. Also coming up today.... We\u2019ve also got the latest surveys of private sector activity across France, Germany and the eurozone this morning, and UK retail sales for September at 9.30am. Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, is giving a speech in London (around 9.10am) And later, the weekly US jobs data, and results from Caterpillar, Amazon and Microsoft.",

Also, the impact this has on the treatment of supplier staff and the quality of our food that we are paying for at the checkout.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Moore Stephens calculate these financial contributions are worth several billions of pounds per year to the top ten supermarkets.</strong><br></p> <p>As Swift explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cYou would think the amount of price reductions that a supermarket can get through supplier contributions is going to be nothing like what we as consumers spend at the tills and relatively you are right.

      "bodyText": "Foxtons shares tumbled on Thursday after the notoriously aggressive London-focused estate agent chain warned that profits would fall this year because of a sharp slowdown in the capital\u2019s property market. In an unscheduled trading update, the company said sales commissions fell by 7.8% in the third quarter to \u00a316.4m, helping to push earnings before tax, interest, debt and other items down 21% to \u00a314.2m. Foxtons shares fell nearly 20% to 165p. The estate agent floated on the stockmarket last September. In its statement, Foxtons said: \u201cAlthough the longer-term outlook for London property markets remains positive, the market is expected to continue to be constrained for some time due to political and economic uncertainty within the UK and Europe, tighter mortgage lending markets, and mismatches between the price expectations of buyers and sellers.\u201d Foxtons said that buyers had grown wary after prices in London rose almost 20% in the last year and were taking on board expectations that interest rates would start to rise next year. Mortgages are in short supply after the Bank of England imposed restrictions on lenders in an effort to cool the property market. Labour\u2019s adoption of a tax on properties worth more than \u00a32m has also increased concerns about political intervention in the property market after next May\u2019s general election. Estate agents reckon at least 80% of homes that would be subject to the tax are in London and the south-east. Foxtons warned in August that the London property market was slowing down but the rate of decline took City analysts by surprise. Foxtons said the slowdown had increased since August and sales for the second half would be \u201csignificantly\u201d lower than the same period last year. Before Foxtons\u2019s warning, analysts had expected annual earnings of \u00a357m. They now predict a figure around \u00a348m. Foxtons\u2019 initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013 was oversubscribed as investors sought to tap the London property market via the chain, which is infamous for its brash sales tactics and fleet of liveried Mini Coopers. The shares floated at 230p and hit a high of 399p in February but have hovered below their float price for the past month. BC Partners, the private equity firm that owned the majority of Foxtons before the listing, sold half of its remaining 14% stake in early September, when shares were above the offer price. Nick Budden, Foxtons\u2019 chief executive, tried to reassure investors by saying the company was free of debt and expected to return more cash to shareholders. Foxtons is sticking with its goal of opening between five and 10 new branches a year and expanding into hotspots outside London, such as Woking in Surrey, and Kingston upon Thames.",

However, we can never recall a period so damaging to the reputation of the company as H1 FY2015. </p> <p>That a powerhouse of international retailing was reduced to a rudder less corporate entity where downgrade followed downgrade, executive followed executive out of the business, with no effective succession planning, capped by a material accounting issue, reflects to a detrimental extent, to our minds, upon those who are the guardians of Tesco on behalf of its owners. In this respect the announcement of the commencement of a change in the Chairman of Tesco is not unexpected and we sense will be welcomed by its shareholders.</p> </blockquote> <h2>David McCarthy of HSBC:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tesco\u2019s problems can be summed up as Tesco having lost its emotional connection with the consumer. </p> <p>This needs rebuilding by Tesco becoming the shopper champion and by behaving as a market leader. This will take time and money.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Josh Raymond of City Index</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dave Lewis is Tesco\u2019s new CEO. He simply HAS to show his strength of leadership to steer Tesco through its worst crisis in decades. </p> <p>His failure to provide a detailed strategic direction for the firm at this stage will only deepen shareholder fears and cloud the markets view of how and when Tesco can bounce back. The fact the firm is unable to tell the market what it thinks it will report for a full year is perhaps the biggest worry. </p> <p>Either its own full year projection is too terrible to state (does not make sense as surely you would want all the bad news out at once) or it simply has no idea how it could perform (equally troubling!).</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Josh_CityIndex/statuses/525166013995053056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Nothing good in these numbers.

      "bodyText": "Tesco reported a 92% slide in pre-tax profits, and a 4.6% drop in like-for-like sales in the UK this morning. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain also announced that it has overstated previous profits by \u00a3263m over recent years; chairman Sir Richard Broadbent is stepping down once the new management team led by Dave Lewis is in place. Here\u2019s what City analysts are saying: Shore Capital: Tesco has had quite a few years of challenge and disappointment. However, we can never recall a period so damaging to the reputation of the company as H1 FY2015. That a powerhouse of international retailing was reduced to a rudder less corporate entity where downgrade followed downgrade, executive followed executive out of the business, with no effective succession planning, capped by a material accounting issue, reflects to a detrimental extent, to our minds, upon those who are the guardians of Tesco on behalf of its owners. In this respect the announcement of the commencement of a change in the Chairman of Tesco is not unexpected and we sense will be welcomed by its shareholders. David McCarthy of HSBC: Tesco\u2019s problems can be summed up as Tesco having lost its emotional connection with the consumer. This needs rebuilding by Tesco becoming the shopper champion and by behaving as a market leader. This will take time and money. Josh Raymond of City Index Dave Lewis is Tesco\u2019s new CEO. He simply HAS to show his strength of leadership to steer Tesco through its worst crisis in decades. His failure to provide a detailed strategic direction for the firm at this stage will only deepen shareholder fears and cloud the markets view of how and when Tesco can bounce back. The fact the firm is unable to tell the market what it thinks it will report for a full year is perhaps the biggest worry. Either its own full year projection is too terrible to state (does not make sense as surely you would want all the bad news out at once) or it simply has no idea how it could perform (equally troubling!). Jon Copestake, Retail analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cIf Dave Lewis wasn\u2019t considering radical action when he began in his role as CEO then he certainly will be now. A 4.4% decline in like for like sales is, in many ways, more significant than the 92% decline in profits given the investment the firm has been making to halt its decline. The bad news doesn\u2019t seem to have an end at present. The current decline comes as Tesco concludes an internal investigation into a \u00a3263m profit overstatement. Tesco\u2019s like for like sales fall also comes as the firm sits bottom of a customer satisfaction survey, despite an \u00a3800m investment in better stores and services by Philip Clarke, Lewis\u2019s successor. To top things off Lewis will have to face the future without the Chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, who is stepping down in light of the accounting scandal. If there is a silver lining for Tesco it is that Lewis will no doubt now have carte blanche in engineering a turnaround. As an outsider he comes in unencumbered by the firms previous mindset and has a clean slate to work from with the blame for the current malaise firmly directed at Lewis\u2019s predecessors. It is also worth remembering that, despite everything, Tesco still managed to turn a quarterly profit and it remains the largest retailer in the UK as well as one of the four or five largest globally. There is a precedent here, with Georges Plassat at Carrefour delivering a quick turnaround by exiting a host of foreign markets to refocus on its domestic share.

But Debenhams has climbed 3p to 65.8p despite a 21% drop in full year profits and a warning that it was cautious about the outlook due to continuing pressures on consumer spending. The figure was in line with downgraded expectations, and chief executive Michael Sharp said: Whilst this has been a challenging year for Debenhams, the brand is strong and our improved second half performance gives us confidence that we are ready for the key Christmas period and can deliver sustainable growth over the longer term. Peel Hunt\u2019s John Stevenson issued a hold note, saying: Full price sales growth of 10.6% over the second half, 5% stock reduction, and 7-8% fewer options for autumn/winter provides a better base for 2015. Combined with a more selective promotional stance into peak, Debenhams expects to deliver margin improvements despite the warm start to the season. Trading on less than 8 times PE and over 5% yield, the shares should find support.",

All of those inoffensive words and phrases could have been uttered by predecessor Philip Clarke. To be fair to Lewis, he has been in the job for little more than 50 days, so a fully worked-up battle plan was unlikely to appear. But, aside from referencing a couple of glory moments from Tesco\u2019s past (Operation Checkout in 1977; and the launch of Clubcard in 1993), he gave few hints of radicalism. He did not sound like a chief executive intent on blowing the opposition out of the water at the earliest opportunity. \u201cProgressive\u201d may mean slow and gradual. But, from the point of view of shareholders, it probably does not mean cheap. Protection and strengthening of the balance sheet was the second of Lewis\u2019s strategic priorities. A rights issue sounds highly probable because all the key financial measures are going in the wrong direction at the rate of knots.

And the deficit in the pension fund has risen from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a33.4bn since February. A cash-call on shareholders would be quicker to execute than a sale of foreign assets (and note: Lewis hasn\u2019t even been out to Asia yet to inspect the stores there). But companies the size of Tesco cannot ask shareholders to dig deep while giving them no clear strategic plan or even guidance on profits for the rest of the year. In the meantime, Sir Richard Broadbent has done the right thing \u2013 or, rather, the inevitable thing \u2013 by saying he\u2019ll quit as chairman when a successor is found. Archie Norman, who helped to lift Asda off its knees in the 1990s and has earned more credibility subsequently in Australia, might be the most popular pick among investors. Whether Norman would want the job is another matter. But Lewis cannot afford to wait to discover the identity of his boss. A new strategy has to appear as soon as possible in the new year. Christmas seems to be case of muddling through with \u201c\u00a35 off\u201d vouchers. In the circumstances, another 6.5% off the share price \u2013 the market\u2019s initial reaction \u2013 is entirely understandable.

This means high gas using households in Victoria for example could see their gas bill increase by over $400 a year.</p> <p>Despite this massive increase in gas prices, free trade proponents argue the government should resist altering the gas market either by imposing export restrictions of a reserve price for domestic gas. </p> <p>This week the Grattan Institute, which has published a <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/report/getting-gas-right-australias-energy-challenge/\">number of papers</a> on the changing gas market, released <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/report/gas-at-the-crossroads-australias-hard-choice/\">another report</a> arguing that the economic benefits from unfettered export of LNG massively outweigh the cost of higher gas prices for domestic users. </p> <p>Its report, \u201cGas at the crossroads: Australia\u2019s hard choices\u201d is aimed squarely at the federal and state governments, arguing that \u201cthe emerging export industry will deliver overwhelmingly positive economic benefits for Australia\u201d. It suggests that governments should \u201cresist\u201d the pressures from unions and business groups to \u201cprotect Australian industry and consumers from the price rises\u201d. </p> <p>But while the report perhaps passes muster according to the economic textbook, the caveats within the report may cause us to wonder whether we in the real world will receive such benefit. </p> <p>First is the profitability of the industry itself. The LNG market is closely tied to the oil price. A recent report <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-20/deeper-oil-slump-a-disaster-risk-for-australian-lng-projects.html?hootPostID=318f29b3382797e5d4f97e595bca8a5c\">from Bloomberg</a> suggests that the recent slump in oil prices could be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for some LNG projects. </p> <p>In the past couple of months world oil prices have slumped due to the US increasing production and a general lack of demand due to the weak European and less than stellar US and Chinese economies. Since June the price for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude\">Brent Crude</a>, which is the world benchmark for oil, has fallen by over 23% from US$111 a barrel to around US$85 a barrel:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/YGyqn/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Although Origin Energy has told its shareholder that it needs a price of $55 a barrel to make a profit, some analysts suggests anything under $80 a barrel starts making the profit margins tight on new LNG projects. </p> <p>The connection with oil prices is also a factor in the benefits an LNG export boom might bring the rest of the economy. </p> <p>While certainly a large increase in LNG exports would see companies\u2019 profits increase, the industry itself is not expected to be a major driver of employment. </p> <p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/fracking-future\">The Australia Institute</a> reported that \u201cthe entire oil and gas industry employed just 20,700 people\u201d. It put that figure into context by noting \u201chardware retail company Bunnings employs 33,000 people\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, the Grattan Institute report cites a study by Deloitte Economics that found an increase in gas prices could cost \u201cmore than 14,500 full time equivalent jobs\u201d in manufacturing and other industries by 2021.</p> <p>So while gas company shareholders will be happy, there is doubt that this boom will lead to more jobs elsewhere and crucially, even more doubt it will lead to an increase in government revenue. </p> <p>And this is a crux of the Grattan Institute\u2019s assertion about the benefits. It notes that \u201cthe argument that Australians have more to gain from trading LNG than they have to lose from higher prices assumes that appropriate tax and transfer systems are in place\u201d.</p> <p>However, one problem is that the mechanisms for companies being liable for the <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Petroleum-resource-rent-tax/\">Petroleum Resource Rent Tax</a> (PRRT), which includes coal seam gas, is linked to the oil price. In 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/new-tax-wont-hit-us-say-gas-and-oil-giants/story-fn59niix-1226457776822\">some gas companies suggested</a> the oil price would need to be $150 a barrel before they would be liable to pay the PRRT on the new gas projects. </p> <p>Certainly the May budget did not anticipate any major boom in PRRT revenue:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/N4t9d/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Grattan Institute paper argues \u201cgovernments need to ensure that the public really does benefit by levying the appropriate taxes and royalties on LNG exports\u201d. That\u2019s a nice view, but given the current governments view toward mining taxes, it is little more than a gas pipe dream. </p> <p>The paper is also rather blithe on the environmental impacts. </p> <p>It finds that if \u201chalf of the electricity produced from gas in 2012-13 had been produced from coal, Australia\u2019s emissions would have been more than 15 million tonnes higher\u201d. It notes that as a general rule gas is more expensive than coal to produce electricity, and that if gas wholesale prices were to rise it is likely that coal powered electricity would become more common. </p> <p>But the report also notes that \u201cwith a carbon price of $30 a tonne of CO2 or higher, existing gas plants would be more competitive than existing coal plants. But if gas prices increase by $5 a gigajoule, gas would not be favoured over coal, unless the carbon emissions price were $70 a tonne or more, an implausible figure at present\u201d.</p> <p>Small problem though: we don\u2019t have a carbon price anymore.</p> <p>And the gas industry as you would expect is only interested in reduced emissions if it occurs through gas production. The peak lobby group for electricity transmission and gas distribution, <a href=\"http://www.ena.asn.au/\">Energy Networks Australia</a> has <a href=\"http://www.ena.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ENA-Media-Release_Solar-Panel-subsidies-are-the-Dinosaurs-of-the-Energy-Industry_23-July-2014.pdf\">recently</a> been arguing <a href=\"http://www.ena.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140926_HIDDEN-SOLAR-SUBSIDIES-PAID-BY-GAS-CONSUMERS.pdf\">against</a> subsidies for solar panels, suggesting that the solar industry is big enough to \u201cstand on its own feet\u201d. </p> <p>But as the Grattan Institute report states, the gas industry itself has been a large benefactor of government subsidy such as the $100 million \u201cEnergy for the Regions program\u201d which subsidised the expansion of gas networks to parts of regional Victoria.</p> <p>There certainly are benefits to the nation from the expanding LNG industry but if, as the Grattan Institute concludes, \u201call Australians have the right to share in the bounty of our natural resources\u201d, a lot more needs to be done. </p> <p>Without a taxation regime that ensures the benefits of the LNG can be shared \u2013 and also used to alleviate the cost to households \u2013 and without a price on carbon, it is doubtful the benefits of an LNG boom are going to flow through as well as the free market theory would have us believe. </p>",

It suggests that governments should \u201cresist\u201d the pressures from unions and business groups to \u201cprotect Australian industry and consumers from the price rises\u201d. But while the report perhaps passes muster according to the economic textbook, the caveats within the report may cause us to wonder whether we in the real world will receive such benefit. First is the profitability of the industry itself. The LNG market is closely tied to the oil price. A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that the recent slump in oil prices could be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for some LNG projects. In the past couple of months world oil prices have slumped due to the US increasing production and a general lack of demand due to the weak European and less than stellar US and Chinese economies. Since June the price for Brent Crude, which is the world benchmark for oil, has fallen by over 23% from US$111 a barrel to around US$85 a barrel: Although Origin Energy has told its shareholder that it needs a price of $55 a barrel to make a profit, some analysts suggests anything under $80 a barrel starts making the profit margins tight on new LNG projects. The connection with oil prices is also a factor in the benefits an LNG export boom might bring the rest of the economy. While certainly a large increase in LNG exports would see companies\u2019 profits increase, the industry itself is not expected to be a major driver of employment. In March, The Australia Institute reported that \u201cthe entire oil and gas industry employed just 20,700 people\u201d. It put that figure into context by noting \u201chardware retail company Bunnings employs 33,000 people\u201d. Moreover, the Grattan Institute report cites a study by Deloitte Economics that found an increase in gas prices could cost \u201cmore than 14,500 full time equivalent jobs\u201d in manufacturing and other industries by 2021. So while gas company shareholders will be happy, there is doubt that this boom will lead to more jobs elsewhere and crucially, even more doubt it will lead to an increase in government revenue. And this is a crux of the Grattan Institute\u2019s assertion about the benefits. It notes that \u201cthe argument that Australians have more to gain from trading LNG than they have to lose from higher prices assumes that appropriate tax and transfer systems are in place\u201d. However, one problem is that the mechanisms for companies being liable for the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), which includes coal seam gas, is linked to the oil price. In 2012 some gas companies suggested the oil price would need to be $150 a barrel before they would be liable to pay the PRRT on the new gas projects. Certainly the May budget did not anticipate any major boom in PRRT revenue: The Grattan Institute paper argues \u201cgovernments need to ensure that the public really does benefit by levying the appropriate taxes and royalties on LNG exports\u201d. That\u2019s a nice view, but given the current governments view toward mining taxes, it is little more than a gas pipe dream. The paper is also rather blithe on the environmental impacts. It finds that if \u201chalf of the electricity produced from gas in 2012-13 had been produced from coal, Australia\u2019s emissions would have been more than 15 million tonnes higher\u201d. It notes that as a general rule gas is more expensive than coal to produce electricity, and that if gas wholesale prices were to rise it is likely that coal powered electricity would become more common. But the report also notes that \u201cwith a carbon price of $30 a tonne of CO2 or higher, existing gas plants would be more competitive than existing coal plants. But if gas prices increase by $5 a gigajoule, gas would not be favoured over coal, unless the carbon emissions price were $70 a tonne or more, an implausible figure at present\u201d. Small problem though: we don\u2019t have a carbon price anymore. And the gas industry as you would expect is only interested in reduced emissions if it occurs through gas production. The peak lobby group for electricity transmission and gas distribution, Energy Networks Australia has recently been arguing against subsidies for solar panels, suggesting that the solar industry is big enough to \u201cstand on its own feet\u201d. But as the Grattan Institute report states, the gas industry itself has been a large benefactor of government subsidy such as the $100 million \u201cEnergy for the Regions program\u201d which subsidised the expansion of gas networks to parts of regional Victoria. There certainly are benefits to the nation from the expanding LNG industry but if, as the Grattan Institute concludes, \u201call Australians have the right to share in the bounty of our natural resources\u201d, a lot more needs to be done. Without a taxation regime that ensures the benefits of the LNG can be shared \u2013 and also used to alleviate the cost to households \u2013 and without a price on carbon, it is doubtful the benefits of an LNG boom are going to flow through as well as the free market theory would have us believe.",
