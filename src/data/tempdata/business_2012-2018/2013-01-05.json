    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We ended 2012 with the chancellor setting out the painful reality of his economic failure. We start 2013 with families getting the bill. The chancellor has overseen an economy that his own forecasters say shrank last year, and has had to downgrade growth for every year of this parliament. Two years ago George Osborne told us he would balance the books by 2015, but after two years of sharp tax rises and deep cuts to services, he says he needs another five years. Indeed, despite the pain, we are no closer to a balanced budget as the economy stutters and stalls. The fact is, as Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have warned, you need growth to get the deficit down. In the global race, Britain has fallen behind, expanding by just 0.7% in the last two years while Germany grew by 3.5% and the US by 4%. This failure amounts to \u00a3212bn more borrowing, because cutting too far and too fast choked off the recovery, pushing up welfare bills and business failures. Now this failure is hitting home, with the triple whammy of the cost-of-living crisis, cuts to benefits and tax credits. For the poorest in society, an increasing number of people relied on food banks over the festive period. The Trussell Trust, which runs food banks across the country, estimated that demand at Christmas had doubled in a year. In Leeds I saw this scandal unfolding when I visited the food bank in my constituency, distributing food parcels not just to the jobless, but to those in work too. It cannot be right that in a civilised society and alongside such wealth, so many cannot afford to feed their families. Far from attempting to confront the unfolding cost-of-living crisis, Osborne is asking hard-working families to pay for his economic mistakes. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that an average one-income family with children will lose \u00a3534 as a result of the autumn statement. At the same time, some rail passengers are seeing their fares rise above inflation. Despite promises that increases would be capped, an anytime return between London and Norwich will go up from \u00a398.60 to \u00a3107.70, a rise of 9.2%. In April, the \"granny tax\" will see 4.4 million pensioners lose out, including those with small personal pensions worth just \u00a367 a week. In the same month, millionaires will receive a tax cut worth on average \u00a3107,000. Even US Republicans have agreed to increase taxes on people earning more than $400,000, yet Tories are giving money back to the wealthiest. And while the government likes to pretend it's on the side of \"strivers\", tomorrow the chaotic and unfair child benefit cuts become a reality. Single-earner families on \u00a350,000 will see their child benefit cut, while some dual-earner families on as much as \u00a3100,000 keep every penny. This is not a policy of a government that understands and appreciates aspiration. To make matters worse, the latest official forecasts for growth in 2013 have been cut, and unemployment is now expected to be higher in every year of this parliament. Tomorrow is also the day that MPs return to parliament. Over Christmas we have seen the prelude to this debate as Osborne has played crude games with welfare, pretending to target those with \"their blinds down\" as others go out to work. But the Resolution Foundation has shown that more than six in 10 households hit by the cuts are in work. The government is hitting families on modest incomes, desperately trying to do the right thing but surviving on low wages. George Osborne and David Cameron do not have a positive vision for where they see our country headed. They should be thinking about the big challenges facing Britain in the years ahead. But no action has been taken on the reform we need to our banking system, national infrastructure or vocational training. They rejected Labour's proposal last week for a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed. They cannot bring the change we need because they don't see anything wrong with the way this country is run in the interests of a few at the moment. In these difficult times, the country longs for a collective spirit \u2013 as we saw during the Olympics. The British people know we face great challenges and sense this is a time for big ideas. Ed Miliband has set out a different direction for Britain. Instead of the race to the bottom planned by the Conservatives, Labour would rebuild Britain as one nation, a country where prosperity is fairly shared, everyone plays their part and no one is left behind. This year you will see one-nation Labour standing up for the young person looking for a job, the pensioner struggling with the heating bills, and the parent juggling work and family life. Sound public finances are essential for our country's prosperity. Difficult decisions are required, but with the deficit rising as the economy struggles, more needs to be done to reduce unemployment, support small businesses and get the economy growing \u2013 all essential for deficit reduction. We need a fairer Britain, where those who are suffering most are supported, not reduced to relying on food banks, where modest and middle income families are not squeezed further and where a strong and growing economy boosts jobs and incomes for ordinary people.

      "bodyText": "The boardrooms of Britain's top private companies are even more male-dominated than rivals listed on the stock exchange, research for the Observer has found. Virgin Trains, bookmaking-to-bingo operator Gala Coral and gym chain Fitness First are among a list of major private firms that have no women on their boards, while some companies such as retailer New Look \u2013 which predominantly sells womenswear \u2013 have no female executive directors. The new data has emerged as the House of Commons prepares to debate a draft European directive on improving the gender balance on corporate boards, as well as moves by equality campaigners to step up their efforts to capitalise on increases in the numbers of female public company directors appointed since former banker Lord Davies published his report Women on Boards two years ago. Research conducted by analyst BoardEx shows that, out of Britain's top 100 private companies, only 64 even publish the composition of their boards. Of those, 56% possess boards staffed completely by men, while 73% have all-male teams of executive directors. The FTSE 100 still possesses eight companies with all-male boards, while the FTSE 250 \u2013 the 250 most valuable public firms outside the main index \u2013 has 28% with all-male boards. Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, which has been one of the leading campaigners pushing for more female representation in the boardroom, described the data on private firms as \"disappointing\". She said: \"This underscores the endemic nature of the issue.\" A spokesman for Gala Coral, whose bingo customers are overwhelmingly female, said the company hired directors on their \"calibre, not sex\", while Fitness First, which operates numerous women-only gyms, declined to comment. Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Trains was last year rated as the UK's 69th largest private company, has been one of the few top business people to support proposals to force the hiring of more women directors by implementing compulsory quotas. A spokesman for Virgin Group admitted that the firm still had \"work to do\". MPs will debate a draft European directive on Monday pressing for 40% of company directors to be female by 2020. The TUC, under the leadership of its first female general secretary, Frances O'Grady, backs enforced quotas, while businesswomen, including Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts and Helena Morrissey, the head of Newton Investment Management, have spoken in favour of voluntary targets. Ahrendts and Morrissey can point to some success in the UK. When Davies published his 2011 report, just 12.5% of FTSE 100 directors were female. The peer set a voluntary FTSE 100 target of 25% of directors to be female by 2015, and now 17.7% of FTSE 100 directors are women.",

      "body": "<p>A visit to Wonga.com, the website of the fast-growing online payday lender, is a seductive experience. \"We know you just searched for payday loans \u2013 you might be glad you found us!

In 2011 it was forced to write off almost \u00a377m of bad loans \u2013 despite claims to be a responsible and \"truly selective\" lender.</p> <p>Founder and chief executive Errol Damelin portrays the typical Wonga customer as a creditworthy borrower seeking speed and convenience \u2013 perhaps like Kweku Adoboli, the rogue trader who almost destroyed UBS, who, it has emerged, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/17/usb-trader-accused-fraud-spread-betting\" title=\"\">turned to Wonga.com to cover spread-betting losses</a> \u2013 rather than someone at the limits of conventional sources of short-term credit such as bank overdrafts and credit cards.</p> <p>On the Wonga website, Damelin <a href=\"http://www.wonga.com/money/wonga-responsible-lending/\" title=\"\">tells prospective borrowers</a>: \"Part of responsible lending for us is being truly selective and making sure \u2026 we are using all the data we can possibly get to help us make the best decision as to whether you can afford the credit and whether it's really good for you at the moment.</p> <p>\"So we are very, very selective \u2013 much more selective than credit cards or banks in terms of who do we work with. It's really based on: 'Is this good for the customer or isn't it good for the customer?' We take that very, very seriously.\"</p> <p>But Wonga's latest accounts show the firm wrote off \u00a376.8m during 2011 because thousands of loans proved to be \"uncollectable\". The bad debt bill is equivalent to 41% of Wonga's \u00a3185m revenues for the year and is almost four times the figure for 2010. Filings at Companies House spell out that an associated accounting impairment was \"mainly related to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations\".</p> <p>A spotlight on the legion of financially distressed Wonga borrowers comes at a sensitive time for the booming payday loans industry. The company recorded pretax profits up \u00a345.5m to \u00a362.4m for 2011, and last summer Damelin was reported to have held talks with bankers about a US flotation that could have valued Wonga at more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>But critics have grown increasingly uncomfortable at the combination of huge profits and few consumer safeguards. More than 40,000 people signed a petition in the autumn for a cap on the cost of payday loans and in November, former Treasury minister Lord Sassoon gave the strongest hint to date that government was growing sympathetic. Sassoon said: \"We need to ensure that the FCA [planned new regulator the Financial Conduct Authority] grasps the nettle when it comes to payday lending and has specific powers to impose a cap on the cost of credit and to ensure that the loan cannot be rolled over indefinitely should it decide, having considered the evidence, that this is the right solution.\"</p> <p>Wonga loans are made at a \"representative\" annual percentage rate of 4,214%, though the company argues this measure \u2013 which customers must be informed of by law \u2013 is unhelpful for short-term borrowers and exaggerates the cost of credit. Wonga has put its float plans on hold.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/wonga-real-cost-payday-loan\" title=\"\">a <em>Guardian</em> investigation </a>sought to highlight the gap between Damelin's public portrayal of a typical Wonga customer \u2013 \"young professionals who are web-savvy, fully banked, have access to mainstream credit and a regular income\" \u2013 and the views of some borrowers and consumer credit campaigners. Wonga <a href=\"http://www.openwonga.com/news-and-views/view/wonga-customers\" title=\"\">responded by suggesting</a> cases highlighted by the <em>Guardian</em> had been regrettable, but rare, examples of unhappy customers: \"It is clearly possible to find some people who are unhappy, in distress or we shouldn't have approved.\" And it added: \"The reality is out of sync with the frequent media view that we prey on vulnerable or low-income families in hard times.\"</p> <p>Asked about its latest bad debt write-off, Wonga told the<em> Observer</em>: \"We are a provider of short-term unsecured finance, a financial sector which due to its nature has always been traditionally riskier than other forms of finance. Despite this, Wonga's industry-leading credit-checking technology keeps bad debts to within single-digit percentages of the total amount we lend. Our bad debt provisions have increased in the past two years in line with the growth of the business.\"</p> <p>Damelin has claimed that Wonga, which will take over from Virgin Money as shirt sponsors of Newcastle United football club next season, had an \"industry-leading\" arrears rate and is more cautious about who it lends to than high street banks or credit card providers. In contrast to traditional doorstep lenders, Wonga says, it turns down almost two out of three first-time loan applicants and runs up to 8,000 high-speed, online credit checks before advancing loans in just 15 minutes.</p> <p>Britain's biggest doorstep lender, the home credit division of FTSE 250 firm Provident Financial, booked impairments of \u00a3224m for 2011. The sum is equivalent to 32% of Provident's \u00a3697m doorstep lending revenues for the year. Provident makes no secret of the fact it caters largely to low-income customers, many of whom struggle to get the credit they need from banks.</p> <p>Last year Damelin claimed that Wonga's arrears rate was about 7%. A source close to the company suggested the figure may in fact be slightly higher, but insisted it was still in single figures. Wonga provided 2.46m short-term loans during the year, with the average advance being \u00a3255 and an average repayment period of 16 days.</p> <p>With Wonga's plans to list on the stock market on ice, the company is reportedly looking to raise capital through a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9700749/Wonga-in-talks-with-banks-to-boost-SME-loans-arm.html\" title=\"\">more discreet bond issue</a>. It remains to be seen whether investors will prove to be as \"selective\" as Wonga claims to be.</p>",

On the Wonga website, Damelin tells prospective borrowers: \"Part of responsible lending for us is being truly selective and making sure \u2026 we are using all the data we can possibly get to help us make the best decision as to whether you can afford the credit and whether it's really good for you at the moment. \"So we are very, very selective \u2013 much more selective than credit cards or banks in terms of who do we work with. It's really based on: 'Is this good for the customer or isn't it good for the customer?' We take that very, very seriously.\" But Wonga's latest accounts show the firm wrote off \u00a376.8m during 2011 because thousands of loans proved to be \"uncollectable\". The bad debt bill is equivalent to 41% of Wonga's \u00a3185m revenues for the year and is almost four times the figure for 2010. Filings at Companies House spell out that an associated accounting impairment was \"mainly related to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations\". A spotlight on the legion of financially distressed Wonga borrowers comes at a sensitive time for the booming payday loans industry. The company recorded pretax profits up \u00a345.5m to \u00a362.4m for 2011, and last summer Damelin was reported to have held talks with bankers about a US flotation that could have valued Wonga at more than \u00a31bn. But critics have grown increasingly uncomfortable at the combination of huge profits and few consumer safeguards. More than 40,000 people signed a petition in the autumn for a cap on the cost of payday loans and in November, former Treasury minister Lord Sassoon gave the strongest hint to date that government was growing sympathetic. Sassoon said: \"We need to ensure that the FCA [planned new regulator the Financial Conduct Authority] grasps the nettle when it comes to payday lending and has specific powers to impose a cap on the cost of credit and to ensure that the loan cannot be rolled over indefinitely should it decide, having considered the evidence, that this is the right solution.\" Wonga loans are made at a \"representative\" annual percentage rate of 4,214%, though the company argues this measure \u2013 which customers must be informed of by law \u2013 is unhelpful for short-term borrowers and exaggerates the cost of credit. Wonga has put its float plans on hold. Last year a Guardian investigation sought to highlight the gap between Damelin's public portrayal of a typical Wonga customer \u2013 \"young professionals who are web-savvy, fully banked, have access to mainstream credit and a regular income\" \u2013 and the views of some borrowers and consumer credit campaigners. Wonga responded by suggesting cases highlighted by the Guardian had been regrettable, but rare, examples of unhappy customers: \"It is clearly possible to find some people who are unhappy, in distress or we shouldn't have approved.\" And it added: \"The reality is out of sync with the frequent media view that we prey on vulnerable or low-income families in hard times.\" Asked about its latest bad debt write-off, Wonga told the Observer: \"We are a provider of short-term unsecured finance, a financial sector which due to its nature has always been traditionally riskier than other forms of finance. Despite this, Wonga's industry-leading credit-checking technology keeps bad debts to within single-digit percentages of the total amount we lend. Our bad debt provisions have increased in the past two years in line with the growth of the business.\" Damelin has claimed that Wonga, which will take over from Virgin Money as shirt sponsors of Newcastle United football club next season, had an \"industry-leading\" arrears rate and is more cautious about who it lends to than high street banks or credit card providers. In contrast to traditional doorstep lenders, Wonga says, it turns down almost two out of three first-time loan applicants and runs up to 8,000 high-speed, online credit checks before advancing loans in just 15 minutes. Britain's biggest doorstep lender, the home credit division of FTSE 250 firm Provident Financial, booked impairments of \u00a3224m for 2011. The sum is equivalent to 32% of Provident's \u00a3697m doorstep lending revenues for the year. Provident makes no secret of the fact it caters largely to low-income customers, many of whom struggle to get the credit they need from banks. Last year Damelin claimed that Wonga's arrears rate was about 7%. A source close to the company suggested the figure may in fact be slightly higher, but insisted it was still in single figures. Wonga provided 2.46m short-term loans during the year, with the average advance being \u00a3255 and an average repayment period of 16 days. With Wonga's plans to list on the stock market on ice, the company is reportedly looking to raise capital through a more discreet bond issue. It remains to be seen whether investors will prove to be as \"selective\" as Wonga claims to be.",
