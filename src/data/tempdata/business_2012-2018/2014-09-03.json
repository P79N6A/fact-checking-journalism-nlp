      "bodyText": "Britain's strengthening economy and reports of a truce in Ukraine helped London's stock market jump to a 14-year high and put it within striking distance of an all-time record peak. European stock markets also benefited from a Ukraine-induced increase in share prices that have been depressed for months while the conflict has escalated. The FTSE 100 moved up 44 points to 6,879 while the German Dax increased by 119 at 9626, shrugging off a fall in retail sales across the eurozone. Figures on Wednesday from the services sector \u2013 which ranges from retailing to insurance, banking to hairdressing and accounts for 77% of the economy \u2013 showed activity accelerated to a 10-month high in August as output and new orders maintained a run of expansion stretching back almost two years. President Obama welcomed the truce, but remained sceptical that the rebels in the east of Ukraine or their Russian supporters would negotiate in good faith and work towards a political solution. Ukraine has proved a stumbling block in the global recovery with economic sanctions on Russia denting business confidence. A decline in German GDP in the last quarter was also blamed on Moscow, which supplies almost 40% of Germany's energy needs. The UK economy has so far proved largely immune to the spillover from the conflict, with only its manufacturing sector suffering a slowdown in growth during the summer. The construction and services sector have remained robust and kept GDP growth surging at a 3% annual rate, the fastest in the G7. The new data are expected to pose a dilemma for the Bank of England, which meets on Thursday to consider raising rates for the first time in more than five years. At its last meeting, two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) voted to increase base rates from the current historic low of 0.5% to combat what they saw as a tightening labour market and potential for inflation. Analysis by the fund manager Legal &amp; General showed that inflation in Britain was likely to increase over the next couple of years in response to a steady rise in employment and average pay rises in excess of inflation. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector jumped from an already high 59.1 to 60.5, which was the sharpest monthly improvement in activity since October 2013. The business activity index, which indicates expansion with a figure of more than 50, has shown growth for the past 20 months. Markit, which compiles the index, said the latest figure was underpinned by sharp gains in new business and predictions of higher demand in the second half of the year, much of it from the financial services sector. Employment increased in August and the latest increase in new work was well above the survey average, said Markit. The only blot on the landscape was a decline in confidence over the outlook for the next 12 months. The prospect of higher interest rates at home and geo-political risks abroad, including the Ukraine crisis, pushed the business confidence index to a 15-month low. The CBI said in its quarterly economic review that Britain was \"on solid ground\" but growth would even out in the second half of 2014 and into next year. It kept its forecast of growth this year at 3% and 2.7% in 2015. This strong pace of growth has been bolstered by rising business and consumer confidence and easier access to credit. Reduced uncertainty over the level of business and consumer demand had also played a part , it said. But it warned that business investment growth, despite being 10.6% higher than a year ago, remained below its pre-crisis peak. John Cridland, CBI director general, said: \"Business investment has been growing better than expected so far this year, but it still has a lot of catching up to do to get back to its pre-crisis level.\" He cautioned against any premature euphoria that the Ukraine crisis was over. \"In the wider world, geopolitical risks are growing, with heightened tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East. This brings with it the possibility of upward pressure on commodity prices and on inflation, and also increased global financial market instability,\" he said. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the robust and sustained recovery in services provided further ammunition for policymakers calling for higher interest rates.\"The sustained elevated PMI readings suggest we will see another quarter of strong economic growth in the third quarter, similar to the 0.8% expansions seen in the first two quarters of the year.\" However, Williamson warned that a recent slowdown in manufacturing growth showed the economy was reliant on the services sector to maintain the recovery. He said: \"Worryingly, the August data show that the economy has become increasingly dependent on the vast service sector as a driver of the continuing recovery. While the services and construction sectors are set to grow by at least 1% each in the third quarter, manufacturing looks to be faring less well.\"",

    "webTitle": "Long-term unemployment almost double pre-financial crisis level \u2013 OECD", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of long-term unemployed in the world's major economies has increased by 85% since the financial crash, according to the latest employment monitor by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD). More than 16 million people have been out of work for at least a year in the first quarter of 2014, up from 8.7 million before the crisis, or more than one in three of all unemployed across the OECD's 34 member countries, the report said. The Paris-based forum gave a stark warning to countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, which recorded the biggest increases in unemployment after the 2008 crash. It said there is growing evidence that part of what was originally a cyclical increase in unemployment has become structural and \"will thus be more difficult to reverse during the economic recovery\". It said: \"Therefore, tackling unemployment where it remains high and driving down long-term unemployment remain key policy priorities.\" The OECD has become increasingly worried about growing inequality in the major economies and the knock-on effects for social cohesion and productivity. Almost 45 million people are without work in the OECD area, 11.9m more than just before the crisis. According to the most recent OECD economic projections from May 2014, unemployment among its members, which include the UK, the US and most developed countries, will continue to decline but will remain well above its pre-crisis level for the rest of this year and throughout 2015. The main message from the report is that governments need to work harder to equip workers with the skills needed to cope with a fast-changing economic landscape. Unemployment is one of the key measures of inequality, it said, along with wages, which in most countries have declined on average in relation to inflation. The OECD was a supporter of workers in southern European countries taking a hit to their wage packets and argues that \"wage adjustments have played an important role in helping the labour market weather the deep cyclical downturn, reducing job losses in the downturn and promoting employment growth in the recovery\". But in a thinly veiled warning to the European Central Bank (ECB), which has hinted at the need for further cuts in wages in Spain, Portugal and Greece, it said \"further downward adjustments in wages in the hardest-hit countries risk being counterproductive\". The ECB has lobbied for hard-hitting structural reforms that include wage cuts to make local economies more competitive. The OECD said this will prove more difficult in places such as Europe where there is near-zero inflation. \"It may be difficult to achieve in the first place; or it may do little to create jobs while increasing the risk of poverty and depressing aggregate demand,\" it said. ECB president Mario Draghi has responded to the lack of growth in the eurozone with cheaper credit for banks in the hope they will increase their lending to businesses and consumers. However, declining real wages have made consumers reluctant to borrow, undermining efforts to increase consumer spending. The OECD noted that most workers had seen a decline in incomes folowing cuts in overtime and bonuses rather than hourly wage rates. Nevertheless, it urged governments to promote demand by creating more jobs with better wages. \"Promoting aggregate demand and job creation remains a key policy priority going forward,\" it said. This is all the more urgent because of the growing risk that for the many who have accumulated long jobless spells, discouragement and loss of human capital make their reintegration more difficult, that is, their unemployment risks becoming structural in nature. \"This latter risk also suggests that policies to stimulate demand should be accompanied by reinforced measures to overcome structural obstacles to finding work. In particular, governments should give priority to providing employment and training measures for the long-term unemployed who experience a range of difficulties in finding jobs and are most likely to drop out of the labour force,\" it added.",

Input cost inflation also moderated, helped in part by the falling cost of imports arising from the strong exchange rate.</p> <p>However, hawkish policy makers will prefer to focus on the overall PMI picture, and especially the strength of the dominant services economy, which shows the economy as a whole gaining further momentum instead of slowing, as the Bank\u2019s projections had expected.

The Nasdaq is up almost 8 points, or 0.17%, at 46050.75. Wall Street has opened higher and European stock markets have been buoyed by news of an apparent ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine said its president Petro Poroshenko had agreed steps towards a \u201cceasefire regime\u201d with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, but the Kremlin denied a deal had been struck, creating confusion on the eve of a NATO summit. However, Putin later said his views and those of his Ukrainian counterpart on finding a political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine were \u201cvery close\u201d and held out hope that an agreement between Kiev and the pro-Russian rebels could by reached by Friday. The FTSE 100 index in London is up nearly 60 points at 6888.67, a 0.9% gain; the Dax in Frankfurt is 135 points higher at 9641.98, a 1.4% rise; and France\u2019s CAC has climbed nearly 50 points to 4428.11, a 1.1% increase. Russia\u2019s dollar-denominated RTS index jumped 5.5% while the rouble-based Micex gained 3.6%. The rouble gained 1.9% against the dollar. It\u2019s been a busy morning. Let\u2019s have a look at today\u2019s main developments. There has been mostly good news about the UK economy. The services sector is booming, according to the latest PMI survey, and survey compiler Markit reckons its findings together with those for the manufacturing and construction industries point to 0.8% economic growth in the third quarter. The FTSE 100 index jumped to a 14-year high after the survey was released. The Office for National Statistics has restated the national accounts, with the conclusion that the UK recession was \u201cless deep\u201d than previously thought \u2013 although it remains the worst since records began in 1948. Meanwhile, the OECD found in its employment monitor that UK workers suffered the biggest cuts in real wages in the developed world after the financial crisis. The Paris-based think tank also says the jobs recovery in the world\u2019s major economies has \u201conly just begun\u201d. In the eurozone, pressure has increased on the European Central Bank to take more drastic action and embark on full-scale quantitative easing, after output growth slowed markedly across the bloc last month and retail sales fell in July. Europe\u2019s biggest fashion retailer Zalando, Asos\u2019 main rival, plans a \u20ac6bn IPO in Frankfurt. George Osborne has opined on the GDP revisions. The FTSE 100 index will be going through its quarterly reshuffle today. Direct Line, the insurer floated by Royal Bank of Scotland two years ago, is seen as the most likely candidate for a place in the FTSE 100. Its promotion from the FTSE 250 could come at the expense of canmaker Rexam or housebuilder Barratt Developments. Barratt only rejoined the blue-chip index in March. Chris Williams, of the UK\u2019s first investment advice service, Wealth Horizon, said: Today could signal a rocky time for one or more of the companies that are demoted from the index. FTSE tracker funds need to hold a certain amount of shares in each of the companies within the index, so those booted out will see the shares drop significantly as managers scurry to realign their fund portfolios to include the latest entrants instead. With the FTSE this week posting its highest level since July, the reshuffle is likely to strengthen its long-term prospects even further. However, some investors will still be cautious to go to heavy into the index before the ECB makes a decision this week about a possible increase in its stimulus package. There are high expectations that the European Central Bank may increase its stimulus package in its meeting tomorrow, following a pledge by ECB President Mario Draghi to use all available tools to keep the economy on course. But investors remain cautious as there remains some significant resistance to quantitative easing, particularly in Germany. The jobs recovery in the developed world has \u201conly just begun\u201d and it will take years to undo the impact on employment of the financial crash of 2008, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Paris-based think-tank said in its annual employment outlook: The employment situation has started to improve, but there is still a long way to go to make up for the job losses that occurred as a result of the global financial crisis. For the OECD as a whole, the jobs recovery has only just begun: the OECD employment rate is currently 1.8 percentage points below its level at the start of the global financial crisis compared with 2.2 percentage points at the depth of the crisis. The report also shows that British workers suffered the biggest decline in wages in the developed world after the financial crisis, even though unemployment has fallen. In the UK, nearly two-thirds of workers saw falls in real wages (adjusted for inflation) in 2010 \u2013 more than the average of one worker in two across 19 OECD countries. Average hourly real wage rates continued to fall through to 2013 in the UK, matched or exceeded only by several eurozone countries hit hardest by the crisis like Greece, Spain and Ireland. Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 changes to the national accounts: These accounting changes to the way GDP is measured - for instance to include drug dealing and prostitution - do not mean families or businesses are better off. GDP growth has been revised up in every year since 2008. But it\u2019s still the case that working people are substantially worse off under this government, that the recovery was choked off in 2010 and that it is the slowest on record. Working people want a plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis they still face, not complacent claims from Ministers that everything is fixed or that accounting changes mean we\u2019re somehow better off. Europe\u2019s biggest online fashion site Zalando, the main rival to Asos, has unveiled plans for an IPO that could value it at up to \u20ac6bn. It plans to list a 10-11% stake in the business on the Frankfurt stock exchange in the hope of raising more than \u20ac500m to fund further expansion. This comes amid a flurry of e-commerce flotations, with Chinese giant Alibaba due to float later this month (18 September), along with the German venture capital house Rocket Internet, which helped launch Zalando and many other start-ups. Here\u2019s a profile of Zalando founder Robert Gentz, a former economist from D\u00fcsseldorf who had the initial idea on a beach in Guatemala. The founders of Hargreaves Lansdown have reaped more than \u00a368m in annual dividends after Royal Mail\u2019s flotation helped business to boom at the investment company, my colleague Sean Farrell reports. Peter Hargreaves, who owns 32.18%, will make \u00a345.7m while Stephen Lansdown, who owns 15.92% according to Reuters, will receive \u00a322.6m. With booming construction markets in the US and Britain inceasing demand for its industrial equipment hire business, Ashtead has increased its guidance for annual profit. The breakdown of the Markit composite index for the eurozone reveals that Ireland remained at the top of the output growth league table in August. Business activity in Ireland rose at the quickest pace since August 2000, underpinned by a similarly strong increase in new orders. Spain also saw output growth pick up, driven by the service sector. In Germany, growth slowed at both manufacturers and service firms. Italy dipped back into contraction territory, halting a seven-month expansion, with services particularly weak. French output shrank for the fourth month running but the pace of decline was \u201cmild,\u201d Markit noted, and inflows of new business improved. Manufacturing remains in the doldrums, however. The decline in July retail sales in the eurozone was mainly caused by a drop in sales of food, drinks and tobacco. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said: July\u2019s 0.4% drop in eurozone retail sales volumes fuels concern that recently weakening consumer confidence across the eurozone is starting to lead to increased caution in spending, thereby harming growth prospects. More bad news out of the eurozone: retail sales slowed sharply in July, adding to worries about economic growth, which ground to a halt in the second quarter. Eurostat said the volume of retail sales in the 18 countries sharing the euro dropped 0.4% in July, in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts. Our data team has compiled a couple of charts using ONS data. The ONS says the inclusion of paid sex \u2018n drugs in the GDP data has not really made an impact. An HM Treasury spokesperson said in response to the ONS data: These ONS revisions show an economy that has been growing more strongly than previously thought, with almost every quarter under this government being revised upward. Cumulatively, growth since 2010 is now over 1% stronger. But the revisions also show that the Great Recession remains the deepest since records began, and risks to the recovery from Europe and elsewhere remain. That is why we must continue to work through the long term economic plan that is building a resilient economy. The Office for National Statistics has restated the national accounts going back to 1998 to 2012. On average, growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points per year. During the recent economic downturn, growth was less weak than previously estimated while, coming out of the downturn, growth has been stronger. However, the length of the downturn remains unrevised. The recent downturn has been the deepest since ONS records began in 1948. The recovery has also been the slowest. ONS Chief Economist Joe Grice said: Despite the wide ranging improvements underpinning the new estimates, the broad picture of the economy has not changed much. Although the downturn was less deep than previously estimated and subsequent growth stronger, it remains the case that the UK experienced the deepest recession since ONS records began in 1948 and the subsequent recovery has been unusually slow. Over the period 1998-2012, the overall size of revisions remains small at an average of 0.1 percentage points per year. Markit reckons its survey data points to GDP growth of 0.8% in the third quarter. It notes, however, that the upturn has become ever more dependent on the domestically-oriented services and construction sectors as growth slowed sharply in manufacturing. The weakness of the more internationally-focused goods producing sector was linked in part to the escalating crisis in the Ukraine. Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson goes on to say: The data send mixed signals to policy makers, suggesting the debate over whether the economy can withstand higher interest rates will remain intense. Policy makers will certainly be concerned by the extent of the slowdown in manufacturing and will be eager to see whether the global economic uncertainty caused by the Ukraine crisis will also filter through to a significant slowdown in services and construction. Some impact is already evident, with growth of new orders moderating in all three sectors in August. Employment growth also slowed further from June\u2019s record high, down to the lowest since March as rates of job creation eased in all three sectors. The weak manufacturing data plus the slowing of order book and employment growth in services and construction therefore reduce the risk of other members of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee joining Ian McAffferty and Martin Weale in voting for a hike in interest rates. Dovish policy makers will also be reassured by the PMI surveys showing average prices charged for goods and services barely rising in August, showing the smallest monthly increase since May of last year. Input cost inflation also moderated, helped in part by the falling cost of imports arising from the strong exchange rate. However, hawkish policy makers will prefer to focus on the overall PMI picture, and especially the strength of the dominant services economy, which shows the economy as a whole gaining further momentum instead of slowing, as the Bank\u2019s projections had expected. The concern is that the growth surge in the domestic economy is eating away spare capacity, which will drive up inflation in the medium term. The FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level in more than 14 years after the strong PMI data, climbing nearly 70 points to 6898.62, a 1% gain \u2013 only 32 points away from its all-time high of 6930, reached on 31 December 1999. In sharp contrast to the eurozone, the UK services PMI has leapt to a 10-month high of 60.5 from July\u2019s 59.1, better than expected. The composite index, which gauges manufacturing, services and construction activity, hit a nine-month high of 59.8, versus July\u2019s 59.0. However, before you reach for the champagne, a word of caution: the Ukraine crisis has clouded the outlook. New business growth at Britain\u2019s service sector firms was the weakest in three months, and confidence fell to a 15-month low. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The eurozone economy is defying expectations of gaining momentum, which will no doubt add to calls for the ECB to embark on full-scale quantitative easing. Services and manufacturing activity in the eurozone slowed to its weakest pace this year in August as escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine took their toll on investment, a closely-watched survey showed. Markit\u2019s composite purchasing managers\u2019 index, which is based on surveys of thousands of companies across the eurozone, fell to an eight-month low of 52.5, well below July\u2019s 53.8. The findings will add to pressure on the European Central Bank ahead of its meeting tomorrow. Germany, the main engine of growth, saw activity weaken to a 10-month low while France, the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy, declined for a fourth month. Germany has also seen services sector growth slow: the PMI from Markit fell from July\u2019s 37-month high of 56.7 to 54.9 in August. Italy is stuck in a triple-dip recession, which has wiped out all growth since 2000. Turning to France, activity in the service sector dipped slightly to 50.3 from 50.4 in July, but stayed in positive territory \u2013 while manufacturing output fell sharply last month. In contrast to Spain, Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, saw a decline in its service industries last month. The PMI fell to 49.8, below the key 50 line which signals expansion, from 52.8 in July. This is the first sub-50 reading since March. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report on Spain, said: Strong growth in activity and new business in August suggest that the economic recovery in Spain maintained momentum during the month. However, other indices from the latest PMI survey highlight the scale of the challenge ahead. Discounting was still required to secure sales in a number of cases, while the latest increase in employment was only marginal despite the fastest rise in activity since late-2006. That said, sentiment remained positive as close to half of all respondents forecast activity growth over the coming year. The Spanish stock market has taken heart from the much stronger-than-expected services PMI. The Ibex is trading 62.8 points, or 0.6%, higher at 10820.6, Spain recorded the fastest rise in services activity since December 2006, led by the finance industry while hotels and restaurants saw the slowest growth last month. The headline business activity index surprised economists with a jump to 58.1 in August from 56.2 in July. European stock markets have opened higher. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 27 points, or 0.4%, at 6856.7. Germany\u2019s Dax has gained nearly 34 points, or 0.36%, to 9540.84 while France\u2019s CAC has added almost 20 points to 4397.77, a 0.4% rise. Returning to the World Economic Forum\u2019s global competitiveness survey, here\u2019s a list of the top ten. Britain moved up to ninth from tenth place, while Finland and Germany slipped one place. Switzerland Singapore United States Finland Germany Japan Hong Kong Netherlands United Kingdom Sweden Let\u2019s have a closer look at the Chinese services surveys for August. The China PMI came in at 54.4, while the HSBC measure came in at 54.2, a surprise rise from the previous month. Asian shares rose on the news: The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.04% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 2%. The Irish services PMI is also out, climbing to 62.4 in August from 61.3 in July, well above the 50 expansion line \u2013 indicating strong growth. A reading above 50 signals expansion; a reading below points to contraction. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: With all eyes on tomorrows ECB rate meeting and the weak manufacturing numbers earlier this week, markets will be hoping for better numbers from the services sector this morning, with the latest PMI numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany due out. As is the case in China, these numbers have generally performed better than the manufacturing sector in recent months, but they have also started to weaken from their peaks a few months ago, and similar weakness will once again shift the focus back to tomorrow\u2019s rate meeting, especially if any of them slip in contraction. Expectations are for Spain to come in at 55.5 , Italy at 52, France at 51.1 and Germany at 56.4, in a further sign of weakening economic activity. EU retail sales for July are expected to decline 0.3%, down from the 0.4% rise seen in June. In the UK the pound took a bit of a swan dive yesterday despite a much better than expected construction PMI number for August, with some speculating that the pound may be suffering a little bit of a vertigo as a result of the narrowing polls in the Scottish referendum. While that may be partly true the decline can also be put down to a stronger US dollar, and euro short covering ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ECB rate meeting. Today\u2019s services PMI number for August could well give it another nudge lower particularly if it disappoints in the same way as Monday\u2019s manufacturing number did. Expectations are for a decline to 58.5 from 59.1 in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ve woken up to the news that Britain has moved up a list of the world\u2019s most competitive economies \u2013 to ninth from tenth place. The World Economic Forum, a thinktank, praised the government for cutting the public sector deficit and maintaining one of the most flexible labour markets in the developed world, as well as investing in new technologies. You can read the full story here. The economic highlight today will be surveys of services sectors across the globe, kicking off with China. China\u2019s services sector bounced back in August after a drop in July, two surveys showed, offsetting weakness in manufacturing. The government is determined to achieve its 7.5% economic growth target this year to keep employment stable, while pushing through long-term reforms. The latest purchasing managers indices (PMI) from European countries for August are due later this morning, with the UK survey to follow at 9.30am BST.",

      "bodyText": "The recent downturn was less deep than previously thought while annual growth proved stronger as the economy began to recover, according to revised official figures. Changes to methodology used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by as much as 6% in the depths of the recession, lower than the previous \"peak-to-trough\" estimate of 7.2%. The revisions for 1997 to 2012 show the size of the economy on average 4%, or \u00a350bn, larger than previously thought each year. Estimates of growth have gone up by an average of just 0.1% per year to 2%. But between 2007 and 2012, average growth has been revised higher by 0.5% a year, mainly as a result of faster growth in investment. ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: \"Despite the wide-ranging improvements underpinning the new estimates, the broad picture of the economy has not changed much. \"Although the downturn was less deep than previously estimated and subsequent growth stronger, it remains the case that the UK experienced the deepest recession since ONS records began in 1948 and the subsequent recovery has been unusually slow.\" The ONS changes include new methodology to bring economic measures into line with international standards. Among these are the inclusion of spending on research and development and weapons as investment as well as the introduction of spending on illegal activities such as drugs and prostitution in the calculation of nation's income. The revised figures showed pre-downturn growth in 2007 was 2.6%, lower than the previously thought 3.4%. But the contraction in 2008 was 0.3%, not 0.8% as previously thought, and the decline for 2009 narrowed to 4.3%, from an earlier estimate of 5.2%. Growth in each of the three subsequent years was better than previously thought. The data failed to provide a solution to the so-called \"productivity puzzle\" facing economists, with output per hour worked at the end of 2012 still around 12% below the projected path had the pre-downturn rates of expansion been maintained. The ONS said the length of the downturn remains unrevised. Further figures on the impact of the changes to date will be published later this month. It comes after the latest report from the World Economic Forum lifted the UK one place to ninth in its international competitive ratings. Chancellor George Osborne said it was a \"double dose of good economic news\". The Treasury said: \"These ONS revisions show an economy that has been growing more strongly than previously thought, with almost every quarter under this government being revised upward.\"",

      "bodyText": "The founders of Hargreaves Lansdown have reaped more than \u00a368m in annual dividends after Royal Mail's flotation boosted business at the investment company. Peter Hargreaves, who owns 32.18% of the firm, will make \u00a345.7m while Stephen Lansdown, who owns 15.92%, according to Reuters, will receive \u00a322.6m. Pre-tax profit for the year ended 30 June increased 7% to \u00a3209.8m as a record 144,000 clients invested through the company. Business was helped by feverish activity on the stock market in the wake of Royal Mail's blockbuster privatisation in October. Ian Gorham, Hargreaves Lansdown's chief executive, said: \"A busy year of stock market activity has been beneficial to Hargreaves Lansdown in terms of adding new clients and new business. Of particular note was the Royal Mail flotation, where around 118,000 people, approximately 18.5% of the UK public who invested in Royal Mail shares, did so through Hargreaves Lansdown.\" The high demand put a strain on Hargreaves Lansdown's service, prompting the company to make improvements in time for the flotation of TSB and the launch of private investor favourite Neil Woodford's fund in June. As a result of increased business and profits, Hargreaves Lansdown increased its annual dividend, comprising ordinary and special dividends, by 8% to 32.0p per share. The total payout is \u00a3142.01m. Hargreaves launched the company from a spare room in his Bristol flat in 1981. He and Lansdown floated the business, which bills itself as a \"supermarket\" for retail investors, in 2007 and both men are now billionaires. Hargreaves is an executive director at the company but Lansdown left in 2012 and has devoted much of his time and financial clout to Bristol City FC, where he is the majority shareholder. Michael Evans, Hargreaves Lansdown's chairman, said: \"The group has once again increased both profits and assets under administration as we achieved record new business flows and record new client numbers. \"We continue to be a financially strong organisation with a simple, strong, debt-free balance sheet retaining a healthy margin over the regulatory capital adequacy requirements. Therefore after careful review of the company's future cash requirements, the board has decided to increase the dividend.\" Hargreaves Lansdown shares were down 0.9% at \u00a311.24 in early trading.",
