      "bodyText": "Fourteen children who were assaulted by G4S and Serco staff while being detained in secure training centres (STCs) between 2004 and 2008 have received damages following a Guardian investigation. Neither company has admitted liability, but almost \u00a3100,000 has been paid out in compensation to the complainants who are now adults. A third was paid by the Youth Justice Board and G4S and Serco paid the rest. The Guardian investigation followed a public outcry caused by the deaths in 2004 of Gareth Myatt and Adam Rickwood in the STCs. Myatt, aged 15, died after being unlawfully restrained by three officers in Rainsbrook STC, near Rugby. He had been restrained for refusing to clean a sandwich toaster, which he said he had not used. Myatt was 1.47m (4ft 10in) and weighed 41.3kg (6st 7lb). One restraining officer was 1.85m (6ft 1in) and 101.6kg (16st). When he told the restraining officers he couldn\u2019t breathe one replied: \u201cWell, if you are shouting, you can breathe.\u201d Rickwood, 14, killed himself after being unlawfully restrained by four adult carers at Hassockfield STC, where he had been on remand for just over a month on wounding charges. Officers unlawfully restrained him using a \u201cnose-distraction\u201d technique (severe tweaking) after he refused to go to his room. The families of Myatt and Rickwood discovered that in all four STCs in England and Wales staff were routinely using force to discipline children. That is against the terms of their contracts with government, which stated that force can only be used as a last resort, to prevent injury or damage. Four years ago, the Guardian received irrefutable evidence that children continued to be restrained for non-compliance in STCs and young offender institutions long after the deaths of Myatt and Rickwood. The Guardian contacted lawyers Bhatt Murphy, who began to seek legal redress for the children concerned. By 2012, the Guardian had traced the whereabouts of 20 children whom we believed had been unlawfully restrained in STCs, 16 boys and four girls. STCS have been criticised for their expense (\u00a3178,000 a year per head), their aggressive culture and the high recidivism rate of the children detained in them. Of the boys the Guardian traced, 15 were back in prison and one in Pakistan, where he had been sent by his parents to stop him getting in trouble with the law again. Two of the girls were dead. One, Cara Burke, was murdered and mutilated by a drug dealer in Brazil in 2009. She was 17. The other, Shanice Paris Goff, died at the age of 18 in April 2012 as a result of a fall from the 17th floor of a flat in Woolwich. An inquest into her death is forthcoming. The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is responsible for protecting children in custody, but it gave conflicting and contradictory guidance on when force was appropriate. In 2008, it even tried to rush through an amendment to the STC rules which made the use of force for good order and discipline lawful. In 2012, The charity Children\u2019s Rights Alliance England (CRAE) launched a high court action to force the YJB to disclose the names of children who had been unlawfully restrained, for non-compliance in STCs. The case came before Mr Justice Foskett. He eventually ruled against CRAE, but his judgement contained scathing criticism of the unlawful use of restraint in STCs. \u201cDuring a prolonged period, restraint techniques were used in these STCs for unlawful purposes \u2026 There is no escaping the conclusion that the monitoring of STCs by the YJB appointed monitors failed to identify and/or act in relation to the unlawful use of restraint.\u201d One of the 14 claimants represented by Bhatt Murphy said: \u201cI was there to help me obey the law, but instead the STC staff themselves acted unlawfully by physically abusing me again and again.\u201d In its letter of apology the YJB said: \u201cWe regret that in secure training centres until 2008 force was used in circumstances which we and the STC providers now know were unlawful. The YJB would like to say sorry to any young person who was subjected to unlawful restraint in these circumstances.\u201d Despite the YJB\u2019s insistence that unlawful restraint stopped in 2008, last year the Guardian reported that five teenage inmates at Hindley young offender institution, Wigan, suffered broken limbs while being restrained in 2012. One inmate had his wrists broken twice, while being restrained by the same prison officer. In all bar one case, the restraint was used for non-compliance. Last year, Rainsbrook became the first STC to start using a new system of restraint called minimising and managing physical restraint (MMPR). All penal institutions holding children are expected to operate MMPR by 2015. The manual depicting the system\u2019s techniques has 182 redactions. Only government officials, custody officers, and a select group of experts know what ministers have authorised. Earlier this year, children\u2019s rights campaigner Carolyne Willow made a freedom of information request to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to see the unredacted version of the manual. The request was refused on the grounds that inmates may study the manual and develop countermeasures to restraint. Last month, Willow went to the high court to ask that the MoJ be made to disclose the manual without redactions. Judgment was reserved until the end of October. In July this year, Hassockfield STC, where Adam Rickwood died, was inspected by the Prisons Inspectorate. A questionnaire at the end of the report revealed that 50% of the detainees reported being restrained at the centre. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2014 to remove details relating to Shanice Paris Goff as the investigation into her death is ongoing. It was further amended on 29 October 2014 to clarify that G4S and Serco did not pay all the total of nearly \u00a3100,000; a third was paid by the Youth Justice Board.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Branson calls on UK politicians to be brave and \u2018bite the bullet\u2019 by aiming for two new runways at Heathrow", 
      "body": "<p>Sir Richard Branson has swung his weight firmly behind Heathrow over Gatwick as the debate over airport expansion enters a critical phase, claiming politicians have privately told him they know it is the right choice but are scared to go ahead.</p> <p>With the Airports Commission preparing to lay out its evaluation of the choice for one extra runway at either Heathrow or Gatwick for public consultation, Branson said it had to be Heathrow: \u201cWe need brave politicians, who bite the bullet and say we need two new runways at Heathrow, and maybe one at Gatwick too.\u201d</p> <p>Branson, whose airline uses both London airports, said there was a danger that people would think building a runway at Gatwick alone could solve the aviation capacity problem.</p> <p>\u201cIf you talk to politicians individually they know what has to happen, but if they feel they are going to lose votes they aren\u2019t going to make the right decision or the tough decision.\u201d</p> <p>Branson blamed slot constraints at Heathrow for Virgin\u2019s decision to retrench its network and withdraw from Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town in favour of more profitable transatlantic routes.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to do a new route we have to close a current route. We have no choice. That\u2019s unlike anywhere else in the world. That will continue until a new runway or two is built at Heathrow.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fly to South America or a whole lot of places we\u2019d like to fly to.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make money of a route out of Gatwick when your major competitor has got a slot at Heathrow, because business people prefer Heathrow and you\u2019ve only got to lose half a percent market share to be lossmaking rather than profitmaking.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive Craig Kreeger said expanding Heathrow was \u201ca better solution in the long run for the UK\u201d even though Virgin could suffer, depending how slots were allocated. \u201cI could think of a lot of scenarios in which it\u2019s bad for Virgin. But I do really believe it\u2019s right for the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Both men were speaking in Atlanta at the inaugural flight of both the new route and the airline\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner, a quieter and more fuel-efficient plane than its existing aircraft.</p> <p>Virgin announced it has now confirmed all the options it had to buy 787-9s from Boeing, making a total of 21 planes. It will be replacing 60% of its fleet with the Dreamliners by 2018, with revamped seating and entertainment.</p> <p>Kreeger said: \u201cIt is a major symbolic and real step into the future for our airline.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has swung his weight firmly behind Heathrow over Gatwick as the debate over airport expansion enters a critical phase, claiming politicians have privately told him they know it is the right choice but are scared to go ahead. With the Airports Commission preparing to lay out its evaluation of the choice for one extra runway at either Heathrow or Gatwick for public consultation, Branson said it had to be Heathrow: \u201cWe need brave politicians, who bite the bullet and say we need two new runways at Heathrow, and maybe one at Gatwick too.\u201d Branson, whose airline uses both London airports, said there was a danger that people would think building a runway at Gatwick alone could solve the aviation capacity problem. \u201cIf you talk to politicians individually they know what has to happen, but if they feel they are going to lose votes they aren\u2019t going to make the right decision or the tough decision.\u201d Branson blamed slot constraints at Heathrow for Virgin\u2019s decision to retrench its network and withdraw from Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town in favour of more profitable transatlantic routes. \u201cIf we want to do a new route we have to close a current route. We have no choice. That\u2019s unlike anywhere else in the world. That will continue until a new runway or two is built at Heathrow. \u201cWe can\u2019t fly to South America or a whole lot of places we\u2019d like to fly to. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make money of a route out of Gatwick when your major competitor has got a slot at Heathrow, because business people prefer Heathrow and you\u2019ve only got to lose half a percent market share to be lossmaking rather than profitmaking. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive Craig Kreeger said expanding Heathrow was \u201ca better solution in the long run for the UK\u201d even though Virgin could suffer, depending how slots were allocated. \u201cI could think of a lot of scenarios in which it\u2019s bad for Virgin. But I do really believe it\u2019s right for the UK.\u201d Both men were speaking in Atlanta at the inaugural flight of both the new route and the airline\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner, a quieter and more fuel-efficient plane than its existing aircraft. Virgin announced it has now confirmed all the options it had to buy 787-9s from Boeing, making a total of 21 planes. It will be replacing 60% of its fleet with the Dreamliners by 2018, with revamped seating and entertainment. Kreeger said: \u201cIt is a major symbolic and real step into the future for our airline. For Virgin Atlantic the experience our customers have is what brings people back, not our network.\u201d However, he said the route to Atlanta, the base of its US partner airline Delta, would give Virgin passengers unprecedented access to 160 destinations in the US. \u201cIt means we can offer lots of connecting opportunities to UK customers to fly via a Delta hub, but get there on a Virgin plane.\u201d Next steps in the joint venture, a response to the market domination of the transatlantic routes by a similar British Airways-American Airlines partnership, will see Virgin start a second daily flight to Atlanta in March. Delta meanwhile is taking over one of Virgin\u2019s services between Los Angeles and Heathrow. Despite the importance of the joint venture to Virgin\u2019s fortunes, Branson rejected recent jibes from Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways\u2019 owners IAG, that Virgin is controlled by Delta. He said: \u201cOne might as well say BA is BA-American. The fact is I own 51% of the company, I will never cede control in my life.

      "bodyText": "Pret a Manger is handing all its British staff a bonus and a pay rise as it enjoys strong sales thanks to the growing demand for food on the go. Sales are expected to rise 17% this year as the privately owned sandwich chain rakes in more than \u00a310m a week in the UK and heads into mainland China for the first time. Pret is benefiting from the change in habits towards eating on the go, which is adding to pressure on supermarkets such as Tesco and Morrisons, which are already suffering from the rise of discount and convenience stores. Clive Schlee, chief executive, said: \u201cThe improved economy has helped us but the main driver is that people eat more throughout the day. It\u2019s not just at lunchtime but in the afternoon and early evenings.\u201d Sales at UK stores open more than a year are up 10%. He said Pret was boosting performance with new ideas such as macaroni cheese, which has lifted sales by up to 3%. The chain is selling 50,000 boxes of prosciutto or kale and cauliflower-flavoured pasta a week. Fruit smoothies and cold pressed juices helped sales in the summer and in January, Schlee is planning to introduce hotpot stews to the mix. The group\u2019s 6,000 British staff will all receive a \u00a350 bonus next month. They will also get a 1.5% pay rise, taking their pay to \u00a36.90 an hour \u2013 40p above the national minimum wage \u2013 as a \u201cgesture to ensure the money goes to team members doing all the work,\u201d according to Schlee. The vast majority of staff also regularly earn a \u00a31-an-hour bonus based on customer service assessments, which takes their pay above the living wage calculated by workers rights campaigners. Pret, which is co-owned by its founders, managers and private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital, is opening or expanding 25 stores a year in the UK and adding 15 more overseas annually. Schlee said Pret\u2019s first store in China was already open with a quarter of the Shanghai-based outlet\u2019s sales made up of coffee. He added: \u201cAnything with avocado is selling well. People say it is hard to get fresh food there.\u201d Pret, which already has outlets in Hong Kong, the US and France, will open two more stores in Shanghai in the next 12 months before deciding whether to expand further.",

      "bodyText": "Asda is facing mass legal action from thousands of female employees who claim they are paid less than men to do equally valuable jobs at the supermarket chain. Law firm Leigh Day said that since revealing in April it was representing 400 Asda employees it had been approached by more than 19,000. The mostly female Asda shopfloor staff claim they are underpaid compared with mostly male colleagues working in the supermarket\u2019s warehouses. The case could become the largest ever employment claim in the private sector, the lawyers said. If Asda, which employs 170,000 staff working across 370 stores and 23 depots, loses the claim it could be forced to pay staff the difference in earnings going back six years. Michael Newman, a discrimination and employment law expert at Leigh Day, said: \u201cIn the supermarkets the checkout staff and shelf-stackers are mostly women. The people in the warehouses are pretty much all men. And, as a whole, the group that is mostly men gets paid more. \u201cOur investigations suggest that the jobs are pretty much the same, in that warehouse staff are responsible for taking items off shelves, putting them on pallets and loading them into lorries. In the supermarket, they do the reverse: taking the pallets off the lorries, unstacking them and putting the items on the shelves. Where the jobs are not similar, we still think they are of equal value.\u201d A spokesperson for Asda said: \u201cA firm of no-win, no-fee lawyers are hoping to challenge our award-winning reputation as an equal opportunities employer. We do not discriminate and are very proud of our record in this area which, if it comes to it, we will robustly defend.\u201d If the legal action succeeds other supermarkets who also own their distribution centres may face similar claims. Most retailers own some of their distribution centres and lease others and use a mix of directly employed and third-party staff. Morrisons directly employs nearly three-quarters of staff in its distribution network. Tesco said it directly employs the majority of such staff even though it leases most of its distribution centres. Sainsbury\u2019s refused to comment on the employment status of its distribution staff but said it owned most of the facilities they work in. John Lewis directly employs 3,500 staff in its distribution network, the vast majority of such workers, while Marks &amp; Spencer employs just a fifth of its staff directly. Unequal pay has been a big battleground in the public sector, with female cleaners and dinner ladies taking legal action over claims they were paid less than men who worked as binmen or street cleaners. Birmingham city council has agreed to pay more than \u00a31bn to settle the claims of tens of thousands of women which go back over many years.",

S&amp;P forecasts that the country\u2019s real GDP will contract by around 3% in 2014 compared to earlier predictions of a 3.8% decline. But it said there was a risk that any further EU sanctions on Russia could negatively affect tourism to the country. Speaking of Russia, Moody\u2019s may have downgraded the country a few days ago, but S&amp;P has kept it at BBB-. However it warned a downgrade could follow if more sanctions are imposed on the country over its actions in Ukraine. And on that note, its\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. It was a much calmer week after the panic seen during the previous five trading days, but European markets still ended, for the most part, in negative territory on Friday. Worries about Chinese growth, concerns about how the ECB\u2019s plans to boost the flagging eurozone economy will work out, as well as the first confirmed case of Ebola in New York all combined to unsettle investors ahead of the weekend. Even an opening rise on Wall Street failed to inspire markets on the other side of the Atlantic. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 30.42 points or 0.47% at 6388.73, still up on the week for the first time since mid September Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.66% to 8987.80 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.69% lower at 4128.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.31% to 19,495.68 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.05% at 10,339.3 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 98 points or 0.59% higher. And after the Draghi comments, Reuters has lines on German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s response: 24-Oct-2014 16:16 - BRUSSELS - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS ECB\u2019S DRAGHI MADE CLEAR TO EU LEADERS THAT STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND IMPROVING INVESTMENT CLIMATE WAS KEY FOR EURO ECONOMY 24-Oct-2014 16:17 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS BELIEVE CLOSER ECONOMIC COORDINATION IN EURO ZONE IMPORTANT, DRAGHI AGREED WITH THIS 24-Oct-2014 16:19 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS DRAGHI MADE CLEAR THAT MONETARY POLICY CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH, FISCAL POLICY MUST REACT AT SAME TIME 24-Oct-2014 16:22 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS UK\u2019S CAMERON DID NOT SAY HE WOULD NOT PAY ADDITIONAL EU BILL, JUST QUESTIONED THE DEADLINE FOR PAYMENT 24-Oct-2014 16:25 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS COULD IMAGINE MOVING FORWARD REVIEW OF MEDIUM-TERM EU BUDGET PLAN TO SEE HOW TO BETTER USE EU FUNDS TO BOOST INVESTMENT 24-Oct-2014 16:27 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS DOES NOT ENVISION USING ESM FUNDS TO BOOST INVESTMENTS IN EU 24-Oct-2014 16:29 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS VERY MUCH APPRECIATES MARIO DRAGHI\u2019S WORK IN THE EURO ZONE, WANTS GOOD COOPERATION WITH ECB 24-Oct-2014 16:31 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS DOES NOT WANT TO CALL INTO QUESTION FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE PRINCIPLE WITHIN THE EU, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS 24-Oct-2014 16:33 - GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS ECB\u2019S DRAGHI DID NOT MAKE ANY ECONOMIC POLICY SUGGESTIONS FOR GERMANY And here\u2019s the full Reuters story on ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s latest thoughts on the eurozone economy and the measures needed to boost it, as given to eurozone leaders over lunch: France and Italy renewed their commitment to reform their economies on Friday in the hope of winning more time to bring their public finances in order but the ECB\u2019s president warned more needed to be done to avoid \u201ca relapse into recession\u201d. After the bloc\u2019s revival came to a halt in the second quarter, France and Italy want to shift course away from the spending cuts that marked the bloc\u2019s response to the 2009-2012 crisis. Germany says debt discipline must continue. Seated around a large oval table in the EU summit\u2019s red marble building, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi told eurozone leaders over lunch that more needed to be done. \u201cWe avoided the collapse of the euro with a joint effort. Now our focus should be to act jointly again to avoid a relapse into a recession,\u201d Draghi said, according to his spokesman, who quoted from his speech. \u201cHope is not a strategy.\u201d He said a coherent strategy for economic growth had to involve \u201cconcrete and credible\u201d structural reforms. Laying out a four-pronged strategy, Draghi emphasised that monetary policy was only one part of an economic revival plan, with the others being reforms, sound public finances and healing the bloc\u2019s sick banks. But despite Draghi\u2019s firm words, the summit underscored how the eurozone has few quick fixes for near record unemployment, leaving it in search of billions of euros for spending that Berlin wants to see come from the private sector. German chancellor Angela Merkel said no country with a national debt greater than its economic output should be borrowing more, diplomats said. According to people in the room, Merkel said record low interest rates gave the euro zone \u201croom to breathe\u201d and that a mix of private investment, fiscal discipline and openness to fast-growing Asian economies was the way forward. Merkel also said a proposed free-trade deal with the United States, which is increasingly unpopular in Europe, was crucial. But such measures could take years to bear fruit, while the euro zone\u2019s poor performance is becoming a wider concern, with the United States and the International Monetary Fund worrying that the bloc that makes up a fifth of the world economy is a drag on global prosperity. Some comments from ECB president Mario Draghi have hit the wires.

One-hundred-and-five banks are shown passing the review, according to the draft statement. Of the lenders that failed, about 10 will still face capital shortfalls they need to plug, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. That figure is likely to change as talks continue before the final results are published Oct. 26, said the person. Full story here: ECB Set to Fail 25 Banks in Review, Draft Document Shows And in the event sales of new US single family homes rose 0.2% month on month to a six year high of 467,000 in September. But the rise only came about because August\u2019s figure was revised down from 504,000 units to 466,000. As previously pointed out, new home sales - which account for around 8% of the market - tend to be volatile and revisions are not unusual. The September figure is up 17% on a year ago, but is slightly below the 470,000 predicted by economists. Following the report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed early gains and is currently nearly 5 points lower. US new homes sales are due, with a month on month fall of 6.8% expected. Wall Street is open and despite disappointing results from Amazon, markets are moving higher, helped by good gains by Microsoft after its figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 49 points or 0.29% in early trading, in contrast to European markets which are still in negative territory, on worries about Ebola, poor Chinese property figures and uncertainty ahead of the ECB bank stress tests, the results of which are due to be released on Sunday. No further comment needed: Back to the GDP figures, and my colleague Phillip Inman says that despite the economy growing chancellor George Osborne has cause for concern: George Osborne is clearly worried. Going into a pre-election war-gaming huddle with his advisers, the economic numbers that once sang a happy tune and are so crucial to victory, now sound a little discordant. It seems churlish to strain for the bum notes in the latest GDP figures. All parts of the economy are growing, with the exception of agriculture. And growing more strongly than they are in any of the major European economies. But it is the chancellor\u2019s words that set off the alarm bells. He said: \u201cIf we want to avoid a return to the chaos and instability of the past, then we need to carry on working through our economic plan that is delivering stability and security.\u201d Adopting the word \u201cchaos\u201d is at once interesting and alarming. He seems to be saying that any other path than the one he has chosen will bring with it a swirling storm of instability. Billing himself as Lord Protector, Osborne risks overstating his case, especially when the GDP numbers are so strong. Growth is moderating, but most surveys report that businesses remain confident about the recovery and continue to hire more staff. As a result, unemployment continues to fall. So what can he be worried about? There is the three months of restrained housing market activity. If it\u2019s true, and we don\u2019t fully understand the link, that much of the recovery is connected to the increase in property buying, then any slowdown is a cause for concern. Except the chancellor wanted the housing market to cool. And his policies are largely the reason banks are refusing to dole out loans after he gave regulators instructions in April to clampdown on risky mortgage lending. A slowdown in housebuilding was also a logical knock-on effect, given that a majority of homes are constructed by a private building sector keen to maintain its extraordinary profit levels. We know he is worried about the slowdown in exports, which didn\u2019t take off four years ago, as he had expected. The eurozone\u2019s impending recession is largely to blame, but a lack of support to exporters, particularly multimillion-pound credit insurance, has also proved a barrier. However, the crucial issue is the government\u2019s finances, which have worsened this year despite the strong recovery. For a man with the electoral cycle stamped on his DNA, it is tragic that businesses and workers are not paying much extra tax. The full piece is here: George Osborne\u2019s choice of words are sounding the alarm bells Here\u2019s our latest take on the demand for more money from Britain and others for the EU budget: Europe\u2019s finance ministers will convene an emergency meeting following the disclosure of a demand for some countries, including Britain, to contribute billions more to the EU budget, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. David Cameron believes the demand for \u00a31.7bn from Britain is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and has secured a gathering of Treasury ministers to discuss the recalculation of contributions which have hit the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands with additional bills, while France and Germany are to receive a rebate. The meeting is a minor victory for No 10 following Thursday night\u2019s disclosure that Britain has been ordered to pay the money because its economy is performing better than others in the EU. Full story here: David Cameron labels EU demand for extra \u00a31.7bn from UK unacceptable Over in the US, and Ford has reported a 34% drop in third quarter profits to $835m, but this was higher than Wall Street analysts had been expecting. The drop was partly due to the costs of introducing its F-150 aluminium bodied pickup truck, with its Dearborn plant in Michigan shut for five weeks to prepare for the launch. There was also a $160m charge relating to restructuring in Europe. More on the EU budget demand on Britain: Back in the corporate world and Shire - recently jilted by US predator AbbVie after a proposed clampdown on tax inversion - has just revealed a 32% jump in third quarter revenues to $1.597bn and a 60% rise in operating income to \u00a3717m. After what it called a very strong performance Shire has raised its guidance and now expects a rise in earnings per share in the high 30% range. Previously it had been expecting low to mid 30% growth. As part of its defence against AbbVie it said it planned to double sales to \u00a310bn by 2020. Shire\u2019s shares are currently leading the FTSE 100, recovering from earlier falls to rise 125p or 3% to \u00a340.20. Meanwhile there is interest in the GDP figures from an unexpected source: If you\u2019re just joining us, or would like a recap, here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s full story on today\u2019s GDP data: The UK economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter but was still up a solid 0.7%, more than most other advanced economies. The slowdown from growth of 0.9% in the second quarter was in line with most forecasts. But after recent economic indicators showing a weaker housing market, and slower manufacturing and consumer spending, some had feared growth could be weaker. Relief in financial markets at the figures, which confirmed seven consecutive quarters of growth, gave the pound a boost in morning trading. \u201cWhile today\u2019s figures show that growth in the third quarter was modestly lower than in the second quarter, we do not consider that the recovery is losing serious momentum,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. The Office for National Statistics said growth in output from the UK\u2019s dominant services sector slowed from July to September and that manufacturing grew at the slowest pace for 18 months. Services remained far and away the biggest driver of growth, followed by production, which includes manufacturing. Construction growth picked up in the third quarter, chiming with reports that housebuilding is at its strongest since 2007. Compared with a year ago, GDP was up 3%, down from annual growth of 3.2% in the second quarter. The solid growth figure is not all good news, however, after it emerged that Britain has been told it must pay an extra \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.7bn) into the European Union budget by the end of next month because it is performing better than its European neighbours. Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets, said the performance was \u201cvery respectable\u201d, though he added: \u201cThe UK chancellor may view this as a mixed blessing, after being given a bigger bill for the EU budget thanks to the UK\u2019s relative outperformance of its European Union peers. \u201cThis will be especially irksome since despite the stronger growth figures, there has not yet been an accompanying improvement in the UK public finances to match.\u201d The Treasury welcomed the latest figures but was quick to point to pressures from outside the UK weighing on business activity. Chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cToday\u2019s strong growth figures show that the UK continues to lead the pack in an increasingly uncertain global economy. With all the main sectors of the economy growing it\u2019s clear that our recovery is broadly based. \u201cBut the UK is not immune to weakness in the euro area and instability in global markets, so we face a critical moment for our economy.\u201d Business groups have also warned that manufacturers in particular are feeling the strains in the eurozone, where some economies are contracting and others are grappling with deflation. The CBI said this week that falling demand for British goods abroad weighed on manufacturers in October. A stronger pound also dented UK competitiveness and export orders dropped for the first time in 18 months. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said the sector was still on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2010 and domestic demand remained healthy. However, EEF senior economist Felicity Burch said: \u201cToday\u2019s estimates confirm the economy has slowed, with little surprise that export-intensive sectors have been most affected. After strong growth in the first six months of the year, the pace of growth in manufacturing has also slackened as a result of weaker demand from key markets including Europe and China.\u201d Taken as a whole the UK\u2019s economy is now 3.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. But in a blow to the government\u2019s ambitions to secure more balanced growth, it is only the services sector that has exceeded its pre-crisis peak. Manufacturing and construction still have some way to go to make up lost ground, the ONS confirmed today. \u201cAlthough there has been widespread growth across all major components of GDP since the start of 2013, the service industries remain the largest and steadiest contributor to economic growth, and the only component of GDP where output has exceeded its pre-downturn peak,\u201d statisticians said. The economy also remains below its pre-crisis level when measured by head of population. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC points out that while total GDP is now around 3.4% higher than its pre-recession peak, the population has also grown by around 4.5% over the same period. \u201cAverage GDP per person is therefore still around 1% lower in real terms than before the recession, which helps to explain why many people may feel that there is some way to go before the downturn is truly over,\u201d he said. And I\u2019m handing over to Nick Fletcher now.... Cheers, GW This is curious... George Osborne has apparently denied that living standards have fallen, in an interview with ITN. There\u2019s no dispute that wages have been lagging inflation for the last five years.... Over in Brussels, the EU summit continues to be dominated by the demand for an extra \u00a31.7bn from Britain due to its recent economic success. David Cameron has demanded an emergency meeting to discuss it: The Dutch, who are also facing a higher bill, are unimpressed: While George Osborne says he only found out on Tuesday: Here\u2019s our round-up of reaction to today\u2019s GDP figures: UK GDP: what the economists say George Osborne\u2019s trip to Derby is part of a push to encourage more women into the workplace. The government is aiming to get almost 500,000 more women in the workplace by the beginning of 2016, which would push Britain\u2019s female employment rate up to match Germany\u2019s. As the Telegraph explains here, the Treasury said it will achieve the target by increasing access to childcare across the country Just in; photos of George Osborne in Derby, on the second day of his trip to meet women working across the UK economy. The chancellor couldn\u2019t resist his favourite hashtag, on a trip to the East Midlands. Osborne has just held some interviews with the broadcast media, so we should have new quotes soon: Today\u2019s GDP figures are important, but they\u2019re only one measure of the economy, alongside wage growth, unemployment, and the deficit. My colleague Angela Monaghan has rounded up the charts that tell the story: The UK economy: six key charts John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, makes an important point: Total UK GDP is now around 3.4% higher than its pre-recession peak in Q1 2008, but the population has also grown by around 4.5% over this period. Average GDP per person is therefore still around 1% lower in real terms than before the recession, which helps to explain why many people may feel that there is some way to go before the downturn is truly over.\u201d Hawksworth also reckons that growth will slow next year, to around 2.5% compared to 3% or so in 2014. But this will still be one of the best growth performances in the G7 in 2015, behind only the US and possibly Canada, following the UK\u2019s chart-topping results in 2014. Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to today\u2019s GDP data with a broad-brush attack on the Tories (and no specific reference to the actual report). \u201cFor all George Osborne\u2019s claims that the economy is fixed most people are still not feeling the recovery. Working people are over \u00a31600 a year worse off since 2010 and these figures now show a concerning slowdown in economic growth too. \u201cWe need a strong and balanced recovery that works for all working people, not just a few at the top. But under the Tories we have stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs which, as the OBR said last week, are leading to rising borrowing. This plan isn\u2019t working for working people. \u201cAnd under this government house building is it at its lowest level since the 1920s, business investment is lagging behind our competitors and exports are way off target. \u201cLabour\u2019s economic plan will make Britain better off, create more good jobs and earn our way to higher living standards for all. \u201cWe will get 200,000 new homes built a year, raise the minimum wage, cut business rates and expand free childcare for working parents. And we will balance the books as soon as possible in the next Parliament, but do so in a fairer way by reversing David Cameron\u2019s tax cut for millionaires.\u201d The pound is broadly unchanged, up just 0.04% at $1.6035. There\u2019s very little reaction to today\u2019s data in the financial markets, confirming that investors and traders had expected a growth figure of around 0.7%. As mentioned earlier, today\u2019s GDP report is only based on two month\u2019s data. And Berenberg bank suggests the ONS may have been too optimistic in its assumptions about September: The number crunchers have assumed construction rises 4.0% month-on-month, bouncing back from August\u2019s surprise 3.9% fall, industrial production rises 0.6% (mom) \u2013 the strongest since February \u2013 while services rise 0.5% mom, the strongest since March. If those assumed growth rates turn out to reflect the truth, then output will head into Q4 on strong foundations. The much discussed UK slowdown will not be evident in September in that case. Alternatively, there may be downward revisions to come.... Although Britain\u2019s growth has slowed, today\u2019s data will probably create sense of relief in Westminster and amongst UK policy makers, says Jon Pryor of City firm Investec. \u201cThe 0.7% growth keeps the country on a 3% annual growth rate, which keeps the UK at the top of the G7 nations. This should calm fears for now that the slowdown in Europe and deflation fears around the globe are not such an immediate threat to the UK economy.\u201d Felicity Burch, Senior Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says UK manufacturers have suffered from weaker overseas demand. \u201cToday\u2019s estimates confirm the economy has slowed, with little surprise that export-intensive sectors have been most affected. After strong growth in the first six months of the year, the pace of growth in manufacturing has also slackened as a result of weaker demand from key markets including Europe and China. But 2014 has still been a decent year: \u201cNonetheless, the domestic economy remains relatively upbeat, and manufacturing sectors with strong exposure to the UK should do particularly well. Manufacturing is still on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2010.\u201d Looking into the data, Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by just 0.4% during the last quarter. That is the weakest quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2013. The weaker global outlook does appear to be hurting UK factories, as George Osborne suggests. Figures yesterday showed that demand for British exports was slowing. Britain will struggle to grow faster than 0.7% per quarter unless conditions improve at home and abroad, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency exchange company World First. \u201cHeadwinds from the current slowing of output in Europe and China are obvious dangers to the UK\u2019s growth picture. With real wages staying determinedly negative at the moment, there are concerns about how much farther domestic demand levels can be pushed. The TUC hammers home the point that wages aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation: General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two economies \u2013 a few people at the top are thriving, but most workers\u2019 wages are still in decline. \u201cThis kind of growth is fragile because businesses can\u2019t keep prospering if their customers have less money to spend. \u201cGeorge Osborne needs a clear strategy for a wages-led recovery or it will be the deficit that continues to grow while the economy runs out of steam.\u201d Although Britain has posted quite respectable growth in the last year, this hasn\u2019t yet fed into the public finances - with borrowing around 10% higher this year than last. And Rob Carnell of ING reminds us that Britain already faces a larger bill from Brussels, to reflect its stronger economic performance. UK 3Q14 GDP has come in at a very respectable 0.7%QoQ, taking the year on year growth rate to 3.0% - in line with market expectations. However, the UK Chancellor may view this as a mixed blessing, after being given a bigger bill for the EU budget thanks to the UK\u2019s relative outperformance of its European Union peers. This will be especially irksome since despite the stronger growth figures, there has not yet been an accompanying improvement in the UK public finances to match. Britain\u2019s weak wage growth is one factor weighing on the public finances, meaning income tax receipts have barely grown this year. You can see the GDP report, here on the ONS website. George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, strikes a cautious tone as he welcomes today\u2019s GDP figures: \u201cToday\u2019s strong growth figures show that the UK continues to lead the pack in an increasingly uncertain global economy. With all the main sectors of the economy growing it\u2019s clear that our recovery is broadly based. But the UK is not immune to weakness in the euro area and instability in global markets, so we face a critical moment for our economy. If we want to avoid a return to the chaos and instability of the past then we need to carry on working through our economic plan that is delivering stability and security.\u201d Another chart, underlining how Britain\u2019s recovery since 2011 has been led by the services sector: Danny Alexander, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says the recovery is now \u201cwell established\u201d, giving Britain \u201cgood momentum\u201d to cope with global uncertainty. And with an eye to next May\u2019s election, he says: Our plan is working and we need to stick to it. The families and businesses of Britain whose hard work is powering this recovery will judge harshly any Party that threatens to squander this progress. Britain can\u2019t forget the deficit or believe unfunded promises. Being sensible with the nation\u2019s money is the bedrock of the Liberal Democrat approach. We will keep a steady hand on the economic tiller because that is the only way to produce the stronger economy and fairer society that Britain needs.\u2019 This chart, tweeted by the ONS, shows how Britain\u2019s dominant services sector provided the bunk of the growth. It\u2019s disappointing that industry couldn\u2019t grow as fast; despite hopes of rebalancing the economy. Britain\u2019s economy is now 3.4% higher than its previous pre-crisis peak (achieved in autumn 2008, before the financial crisis plunged the world economy into crisis) Some historical context: On an annual basis, UK GDP is 3.0% higher than a year ago. That outpaces our major European rivals (France, for example, hasn\u2019t grown for the last six months) All four sectors of the UK grew in the last quarter. The services sector grew by 0.7% Industrial production rose by 0.5% Construction output rose by 0.8% And agriculture grew by 0.3% So, the UK recovery has slowed, largely as economists had expected. Not a major shock. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014, according to figures just released by the Office for National Statistics. That follows growth of 0.9% in the second quarter of the year, so the UK\u2019s growth has slowed. Five minutes to go until we learn how fast the UK grew in the last quarter (if you\u2019re just joining us, our introduction on today\u2019s growth figures is at 8am). The Office for National Statistics have briefed newswire reporters at a \u2018lock-in\u2019 in London, so we\u2019ll get the numbers at 9.30am exactly. RBC Capital Markets reckon the UK economy grew by 0.7% last quarter, but recent weaker data suggest that \u201cthe risks are tilted slightly to the downside\u201d. This chart shows how the UK service sector has recovered faster than the rest of the economy, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, predicts that the UK grew by 0.7% or 0.8% in the last quarter (not exactly sticking his neck out!) That\u2019s: \u201cstill quite respectable in the relatively slow growth world we\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis\u201d. Sentance also reckons that the UK will lead the G7 growth league this year, for the 10th time since 1980. James Knightley, economist at ING, predicts that UK GDP rose by 0.8% in the third quarter, down from 0.9% in Q2. That\u2019s partly due to weaker Eurozone demand, but the story remains \u201cvery positive\u201d, he adds: Today\u2019s 3Q GDP report is expected to show the seventh consecutive quarter of expansion with the economy 10.2% larger than it was when activity bottomed out in 2009. And here\u2019s a Vine from Number 11, via Sophy Ridge: Is the chancellor having a party? A large Carlsberg van has been spotted outside George Osborne\u2019s residence in Downing Street. That\u2019s via Sophy Ridge of Sky News: Or drowning his sorrows? We\u2019ll find out in 40 minutes..... Robert Oxley fears that Brussels could dip deeper into Britain\u2019s pockets, if today\u2019s growth figures are decent European stock markets have all dropped this morning, by around 0.4%. That follows a late selloff on Wall Street, after a doctor in New York tested positive for Ebola. Marc Ostwald of ASM Investor Services says: The news flow on the NY Ebola case will naturally catch plenty of attention, while the European Council meeting to discuss the EU Budget is set to be a stormy affair, above all in the wake of the demand for an extra \u00a31.7 Bln from the UK (because the economy\u2019s doing so \u201cwell\u201d) Today\u2019s growth figures are overshadowed by the news that Britain has been asked to contribute another \u00a31.7bn to the European Union budget..... ...because its economy has performed better than its EU neighbours. The revelation dominates today\u2019s front pages, and has outraged critics of Brussels. As my colleagues Ian Traynor and Nick Watt explain: The demand is certain to be used against David Cameron by the growing camp who want the UK to quit the EU. British and European commission officials confirmed that the Treasury had been told last week that budget contribution calculations based on gross national income (GNI) adjustments carried out by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, had exposed a huge discrepancy between what Britain had been asked to contribute and what it should be paying, because of the UK\u2019s recovery Full story: EU budget: UK ordered to pay extra \u20ac2.1bn by December France and Germany, meanwhile, are expected to get rebates. A reward for stagnation? You can imagine the howls of outrage. But here\u2019s a flavour anyway, from Conservative Peer Lord Michael Ashcroft: Times columnist Tim Montgomery: And Robert Oxley of Business for Britain: But, as former MP Denis MacShane points out -- Britain has benefitted from these same calculations in the past: A quick disclaimer on today\u2019s growth figures. GDP isn\u2019t a perfect tool, by any measure. Today\u2019s numbers are only based on data from July and August - ONS statisticians will have extrapolated those figures into September. And it\u2019s a blunt instrument, that doesn\u2019t care whether economic activity was harmful or beneficial to the UK, for example (building a hugely polluting power station is treated alongside a new hospital). And it doesn\u2019t take any account of income inequality -- whether the growth was spread \u2018fairly\u2019, or \u2018unfairly\u2019. As the brilliant John Kay wrote in the FT in April: It values expenditure on war and nursing care on the same basis. It records the despoliation of the environment only by reference to the amount spent despoiling it, and then includes the amount spent to clean it up. It does not tell us how happy we are or how fulfilling are our lives. It also struggles to measure technological change, and flatters countries with large reserves of natural resources or jam-packed with multinational companies. Good morning. It\u2019s GDP Day - when we get the first official indication of how the UK economy performed in the third quarter of 2014. And we\u2019re expecting to find that Britain\u2019s economy slowed over the summer. City economists predict that UK GDP rose by 0.7% between the start of July and the end of September. Not a bad result, but a less vigorous performance than the first six months of 2014 (GDP rose by a healthy 0.9% in the April-June quarter). A poor reading will raise concerns that Britain\u2019s recovery is losing pace, in the face of a weakening world economy. The eurozone ground to a halt earlier in the year, while growth in China also slowed in the last three months. The GDP report comes at a somewhat tricky time for chancellor George Osborne. The latest public finance figures showed that the UK borrowed more this year than a year ago, despite the fabled Long-term Economic Plan (a phrase I fear we\u2019ll hear a few times today). The data will also show which parts of the UK economy fared particularly well, or badly, last quarter. Economists reckon the service sector, which makes up about three quarters of the economy, probably outpaced manufacturing and construction. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics warns: \u201cThe provisional estimate of Q3 GDP is likely to show that the economic recovery has maintained a healthy degree of momentum, but has become increasingly dependent on the services sector. \u201cThe upshot is that while the recovery remains robust, it has become a bit more unbalanced.\u201d The data is released by the Office for National Statistics at 9.30am BST on the dot. I\u2019ll track all the details and reaction, along with any other major business and finance news -- including how the markets react to the news that a US doctor has tested positive for Ebola in New York.",

Going into a pre-election war-gaming huddle with his advisers, the economic numbers that once sang a happy tune and are so crucial to victory, now sound a little discordant.</p> <p>It seems churlish to strain for the bum notes in the latest GDP figures. All parts of the economy are growing, with the exception of agriculture. And growing more strongly than they are in any of the major European economies.<br></p> <p>But it is the chancellor\u2019s words that set off the alarm bells. He said: \u201cIf we want to avoid a return to the chaos and instability of the past, then we need to carry on working through our economic plan that is delivering stability and security.\u201d</p> <p>Adopting the word \u201cchaos\u201d is at once interesting and alarming. He seems to be saying that any other path than the one he has chosen will bring with it a swirling storm of instability.</p> <p>Billing himself as Lord Protector, Osborne risks overstating his case, especially when the GDP numbers are so strong. Growth is moderating, but most surveys report that businesses remain confident about the recovery and continue to hire more staff. As a result, unemployment continues to fall.</p> <p>So what can he be worried about? There is the three months of restrained housing market activity. If it\u2019s true, and we don\u2019t fully understand the link, that much of the recovery is connected to the increase in property buying, then any slowdown is a cause for concern. Except the chancellor wanted the housing market to cool. And his policies are largely the reason banks are refusing to dole out loans after he gave regulators instructions in April to clampdown on risky mortgage lending.</p> <p>A slowdown in housebuilding was also a logical knock-on effect, given that a majority of homes are constructed by a private building sector keen to maintain its extraordinary profit levels.</p> <p>We know he is worried about the slowdown in exports, which didn\u2019t take off four years ago, as he had expected. The eurozone\u2019s impending recession is largely to blame, but a lack of support to exporters, particularly multimillion-pound credit insurance, has also proved a barrier.</p> <p>However, the crucial issue is the government\u2019s finances, which have worsened this year despite the strong recovery. For a man with the electoral cycle stamped on his DNA, it is tragic that businesses and workers are not paying much extra tax.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full piece is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/oct/24/george-osborne-uk-economy-tax-election?CMP=twt_gu\">George Osborne\u2019s choice of words are sounding the alarm bells</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-544a4df4e4b08238a547039e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-24T13:07:02.897Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our latest take on the demand for more money from Britain and others for the EU budget:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe\u2019s finance ministers will convene an emergency meeting following the disclosure of a demand for some countries, including Britain, to contribute billions more to the EU budget, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said.</p> <p>David Cameron believes the demand for \u00a31.7bn from Britain is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and has secured a gathering of Treasury ministers to discuss the recalculation of contributions which have hit the UK, Italy, and the Netherlands with additional bills, while France and Germany are to receive a rebate.</p> <p>The meeting is a minor victory for No 10 following Thursday night\u2019s disclosure that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/uk-european-commission-eu-budget-contribution\">Britain has been ordered to pay the money because its economy is performing better</a> than others in the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/david-cameron-eu-budget-demand-europe\">David Cameron labels EU demand for extra \u00a31.7bn from UK unacceptable</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/525633082599424000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I&#39;m angry at the sudden presentation of a \u20ac2bn bill to the UK by the EU.

But after recent economic indicators showing a weaker housing market, and slower manufacturing and consumer spending, some had feared growth could be weaker.

In contrast to the gleaming corporate headquarters, cattle herders and endless prairies in the opening credits of the fabled TV soap, the oil find is in woodland at Horse Hill, on the border of Surrey and Sussex. The nearest commercial centre is the commuter town of Horley with its two business parks, modern leisure centre and bustling hospitality industry. UK Oil &amp; Gas Investments, one of the investors in Horse Hill Developments, the well operator, said preliminary estimates showed there were 3.1m barrels of oil in the well\u2019s upper Portland sandstone, with potential for a further 16.8m barrels nearby. There could also be gas lower down, and the developer expects to drill to that point in the next two weeks.

Like JR, the former deal-making eldest Ewing brother in Dallas, Lenigas has faced opposition from environmental campaigners.

      "standfirst": "<p>Economic growth slowed to 0.7% in the third quarter from 0.9% in the second. Growth was broad-based across all major sectors. Here is the view from the experts</p>", 
      "body": "<p>All main sectors of the economy grew. The pace of expansion slowed however, from 0.9% in the second quarter, to 0.7% in the third quarter, with fears mounting that recovery could be knocked further off course by a weak eurozone economy and rising uncertainty in global markets. Here, some of the UK\u2019s economists and commentators respond to the GDP figures from the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2014/stb-gdp-preliminary-estimate--q3-2014.html\">Office for National Statistics</a>. </p> <h2>Rob Carnell, ING </h2> <p>UK third-quarter GDP has come in at a very respectable 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, taking the year-on-year growth rate to 3% \u2013 in line with market expectations. The chancellor may view this as a mixed blessing, after being given a bigger bill for the EU budget thanks to the UK\u2019s relative outperformance of its EU peers. </p> <p>This will be especially irksome since despite the stronger growth figures, there has not yet been an accompanying improvement in the UK public finances to match. Furthermore, despite this good growth performance, recent UK data has been a bit less upbeat.<br></p> <h2><strong><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary<br></strong></strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a tale of two economies \u2013 a few people at the top are thriving, but most workers\u2019 wages are still in decline. This kind of growth is fragile because businesses can\u2019t keep prospering if their customers have less money to spend. George Osborne needs a clear strategy for a wages-led recovery or it will be the deficit that continues to grow while the economy runs out of steam.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The government will likely see growth of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter as still offering support to its handling of the economy.

      "bodyText": "All main sectors of the economy grew. The pace of expansion slowed however, from 0.9% in the second quarter, to 0.7% in the third quarter, with fears mounting that recovery could be knocked further off course by a weak eurozone economy and rising uncertainty in global markets. Here, some of the UK\u2019s economists and commentators respond to the GDP figures from the Office for National Statistics. Rob Carnell, ING UK third-quarter GDP has come in at a very respectable 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, taking the year-on-year growth rate to 3% \u2013 in line with market expectations. The chancellor may view this as a mixed blessing, after being given a bigger bill for the EU budget thanks to the UK\u2019s relative outperformance of its EU peers. This will be especially irksome since despite the stronger growth figures, there has not yet been an accompanying improvement in the UK public finances to match. Furthermore, despite this good growth performance, recent UK data has been a bit less upbeat. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary It\u2019s a tale of two economies \u2013 a few people at the top are thriving, but most workers\u2019 wages are still in decline. This kind of growth is fragile because businesses can\u2019t keep prospering if their customers have less money to spend. George Osborne needs a clear strategy for a wages-led recovery or it will be the deficit that continues to grow while the economy runs out of steam. Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight The government will likely see growth of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter as still offering support to its handling of the economy. The government will be fervently hoping that growth holds up well as the May 2015 general election draws ever nearer, and it will be particularly hoping that earnings growth picks up and inflation remains low so that an increasing number of voters feel that their living standards are improving. Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics The preliminary estimate of Q3 GDP shows that the UK\u2019s economic recovery has broadly maintained its momentum despite a weak global environment and the stronger sterling exchange rate. Admittedly, recent sharp falls in equity prices, growing signs of renewed stagnation in the eurozone and some softer manufacturing surveys have intensified concerns that the recovery will lose pace in the fourth quarter. But the UK economy has shown on several occasions in the past that it can outperform the rest of Europe for sustained periods. Felicity Burch, manufacturing trade body EEF Today\u2019s estimates confirm the economy has slowed, with little surprise that export-intensive sectors have been most affected. After strong growth in the first six months of the year, the pace of growth in manufacturing has also slackened as a result of weaker demand from key markets including Europe and China. Nonetheless, the domestic economy remains relatively upbeat, and manufacturing sectors with strong exposure to the UK should do particularly well. Manufacturing is still on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2010. David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce It is disappointing that GDP growth slowed in the third quarter, but not surprising in view of recent data. But it is important to put this slowdown into context; the economy is still growing at a satisfactory pace and we are expanding more rapidly than most other G7 economies. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that our economy is facing major challenges. We have unsustainable twin deficits \u2013 both on the budget and on the current account, and the problems being felt by our major trading partners in Europe are adding to the difficulties facing our exporters. Alan Clarke, Scotiabank The first estimate of third quarter GDP was bang in line with expectations at 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. That may be down on 0.9% quarter-on-quarter during Q2, but it is not a bad reading by any stretch of the imagination. A 2.8% annualised growth rate is very respectable and still above trend.

Even if last year\u2019s seasonality in marketing spend is observed and there is a large price hike to affect the fourth quarter, we expect that an 80% second half over first increase in EBITDA may prove challenging and earnings momentum is set to stall at best.

First, it was the UK\u2019s VAT ruling on early payment schemes, second, it was Ofcom\u2019s final decision on [BT\u2019s superfast broadband] charges, which were less than favourable for resellers. And now consensus figures suggest a mountain for TalkTalk to climb in the second half in order to meet the market\u2019s full-year estimates. Even if last year\u2019s seasonality in marketing spend is observed and there is a large price hike to affect the fourth quarter, we expect that an 80% second half over first increase in EBITDA may prove challenging and earnings momentum is set to stall at best. In addition, the unexpected departure of the chief financial officer does not fill us with confidence that his replacement may not take a natural opportunity to revise targets. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley\u2019s note indicated it preferred Vodafone over BT. Back among the fallers, Pearson has fallen 27p to \u00a311.42 after the publishing and education group reported flat underlying nine month revenues and said chief financial officer Robin Freestone would step down by the end of next year. Numis said: All in another in line statement is a small positive, the loss of the CFO negative. No change to forecasts. We remain comfortable with our Hold, we see better safer value elsewhere in the sector.",
