      "bodyText": "Was it all about Mike Ashley's ego? Was Sports Direct's fourth, and successful, attempt to give its founder the chance to earn a fat bonus just about demonstrating that outside shareholders could be strong-armed into submission? That's the way it looks now that Ashley has said he doesn't want any of the 25m shares up for grabs in the company's 2015 bonus scheme, which was approved by a narrow majority earlier this month. It is a more credible explanation than the one provided by Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell: \"Following recent unhelpful speculation surrounding his potential allocation, he [Ashley] is determined to ensure that there is the maximum number of shares available for the eligible employees.\" Unhelpful speculation? What did Ashley and Hellawell expect? The main reason 40% of shareholders voted against the 2015 scheme was that Sports Direct refused to say how many shares would be earmarked for its founder, 58% shareholder and executive deputy chairman. But outside shareholders were not the only ones who would want to know. After two incarnations of staff bonus scheme, Sports Direct's 3,000 permanent employees are experts on how the mathematics work. As pointed out here at the time, they could see that every share reserved for Ashley meant a smaller slice of the pie for them. That was always the economic madness of the proposal from Ashley's point of view. His 58% shareholding is worth about \u00a32.5bn so his main gain would always come in the form of a higher share price. Even if 8m shares, currently worth about \u00a356m, had doubled in value by the time the scheme matured in 2019, the bonus winnings would represent loose change by his standards. It was obvious at the outset that Ashley's overwhelming self-interest lay in ensuring the staff scheme operated as an effective motivational tool. This saga, then, has reached its logical conclusion: the full 25m shares will be reserved for staff and Sports Direct has dropped the idea of ever giving Ashley a share-based incentive. When he owns 58%, the boss needs no extra incentive to get up in the morning. The losers are Hellawell and his fellow non-executives. They look ridiculous for risking war with outside shareholders pointlessly. One of those non-execs, Charles McCreevy, the former Irish finance minister and EU commissioner, chose Wednesdaywed to announce his departure after just three years in the post. \"I have enjoyed my time as director and have found the whole experience enjoyable, stimulating, and fulfilling,\" said McCreevy. Is \"stimulating\" code for \"utterly baffling\"?",

But at every one of those businesses - for which his paid a combined \u00a31.8m a year \u2013 he has angered shareholders in recent months.</p> <p>The 65-year old joined GUS, a vast empire of businesses that used to be known as Great Universal Stores, after three years at the Sandhurst military college.</p> <p>But instead of a life in a military, Peace worked his way through the corporate ranks at GUS and earned his spurs when he helped set up the credit-checking agency that became Experian in 1980.</p> <p>He was named chief executive of GUS in 2000 after the long-standing boss Lord Wolfson retired.</p> <p>Peace went on to sell and buy 50 businesses at GUS. He floated off the retail chain Burberry in 2002 \u2013 which he still chairs \u2013 and the Experian business in 2006.</p> <p>Both chairmanships have proved controversial, as have their succession plans. The new boss of Burberry, Christopher Bailey, is also the firm's chief designer and his \u00a320m pay package prompted the biggest shareholder revolt so far this year when nearly 53% of investors voted against the arrangement.</p> <p>A boardroom change has also angered investors at Experian.

      "bodyText": "The son of a Nottingham coal miner, Sir John Peace is now part of the City establishment \u2013 until Wednesday chairing three FTSE 100 companies: Burberry, Experian and Standard Chartered. But at every one of those businesses - for which his paid a combined \u00a31.8m a year \u2013 he has angered shareholders in recent months. The 65-year old joined GUS, a vast empire of businesses that used to be known as Great Universal Stores, after three years at the Sandhurst military college. But instead of a life in a military, Peace worked his way through the corporate ranks at GUS and earned his spurs when he helped set up the credit-checking agency that became Experian in 1980. He was named chief executive of GUS in 2000 after the long-standing boss Lord Wolfson retired. Peace went on to sell and buy 50 businesses at GUS. He floated off the retail chain Burberry in 2002 \u2013 which he still chairs \u2013 and the Experian business in 2006. Both chairmanships have proved controversial, as have their succession plans. The new boss of Burberry, Christopher Bailey, is also the firm's chief designer and his \u00a320m pay package prompted the biggest shareholder revolt so far this year when nearly 53% of investors voted against the arrangement. A boardroom change has also angered investors at Experian. Peace finally left the firm Wednesday after handing over the chairman's seat to Don Robert, his long-standing colleague and the chief executive of the business since it was spun out from GUS. Such moves contravene governance guidelines and 30% of shareholders Wednesday failed to support Robert staying on as a director. Peace had first promised to resign from Experian five years ago when he was named chairman of Standard Chartered, a position where he also run into controversy. At the bank's annual meeting in May more than 40% of shareholders failed to back the remuneration report. Last year Peace had to issue a grovelling apology to the US authorities after he dismissed breaches of sanctions to Iran as \"clerical errors\". Peace keeps close ties to Nottinghamshire, where Experian employs more than 2,000, and also finds time to be the Queen's representative in his home county, where he holds the official title of Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. He set up a youth employment fund when he was high sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 2011 and was knighted in the Queen's birthday honours in 2011.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley leaves controversial bonus scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley has bowed to pressure from the City and withdrawn his controversial participation in the firm's bonus scheme, only a fortnight after winning shareholder approval. Sports Direct shareholders passed a bonus plan this month that would give \u00a3200m in shares to 3,000 permanent staff, including Ashley, if earnings double by 2019. It was Sports Direct's fourth attempt to push through a big payout for its billionaire founder, who owns 58% of the company, and is deputy chairman. Although shareholders voted for the scheme, it ran into trouble almost immediately when leading investors who had opposed the deal began plotting a revolt at the annual general meeting in September. Disgruntled investors were planning to vote against the re-election of chairman Keith Hellawell and other board members. Shortly after announcing Ashley's about-turn, Sports Direct said that non-executive director Charles McCreevy would be stepping down at the shareholder meeting in September. It was not clear on Wednesday if shareholders planned to continue their campaign. Will Pomroy, corporate governance chief of the National Association of Pension Funds, said shareholders were likely to \"continue to engage with the board to discuss concerns in the lead up to the firm's September AGM\". Sports Direct said on Wednesday that Ashley had decided to withdraw from the bonus scheme after discussion with the company's remuneration committee. Hellawell said Ashley was \"fully committed\" to achieving the stretching targets laid down under the scheme and indicated that including the founder of the chain in the plan may have caused unhappiness among staff. \"Following recent unhelpful speculation surrounding his potential allocation, [Ashley] is determined to ensure that there is the maximum number of shares available for the eligible employees,\" he said. Ashley, who acts as executive deputy chairman but does not take a salary, also told the board he was not expecting any bonus plan to be put before shareholders while the current scheme is in place, in effect drawing a line under his bid for a huge payout for the next five years. The U-turn surprised the City. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"Maybe Mike realised that he would end up getting too much and would thus squeeze out the staff, which would be counter-productive. \"Plenty of people thought Mike Ashley shouldn't need any more motivation, given his huge shareholding in the company, so presumably that is what will keep him going from now on ... For example, a 10p dividend would generate him income of well over \u00a330m, which would keep the wolf from the door.\" Other analysts suggested that Ashley was never interested in a payout and had simply enjoyed showing certain elements within the City that he could flex his muscles and win a bonus scheme if he so wished. The climbdown was welcomed by the Institute of Directors. Roger Barker, director of corporate governance, said: \"Mike Ashley is to be congratulated for recognising the governance concerns associated with this pay plan. As a director, senior executive and major shareholder of Sports Direct, he occupies a position of unique influence in the organisation. By taking this step, he is helping improve external perceptions of Sports Direct's governance, which will ultimately be beneficial to all stakeholders.\" Ashley's decision to withdraw means Sports Direct's 3,000 full-time employees will get a bigger share of the windfall. However, 90% of staff, who are employed on zero-hours contracts, will get nothing. While Sports Direct has been performing robustly, the bonus saga has left some investors with awkward questions about Sports Direct's leadership. A top 20 shareholder who had intended to vote against the re-election of Hellawell told the Guardian earlier this month: \"The overriding impression created by this episode is of an incredibly weak board.\" Sports Direct, which has more than 600 stores in Europe, including 400 in the UK, has just announced plans to launch in Australia and New Zealand, and is expected to unveil another strong set of sales figures on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "BT has dismissed calls from privacy campaigners to publish a transparency report revealing its links with the intelligence agency GCHQ and other government surveillance services. Speaking at the telecoms group's annual general meeting in London, its chairman, Sir Michael Rake, rejected the notion that BT should follow the lead of companies such as Vodafone and AT&amp;T by releasing a report on its dealings with government agencies. Last month Vodafone, one of the world's largest mobile phone companies, revealed that government agencies in 29 countries were eavesdropping on its networks.

      "bodyText": "Fresh calls for a US crackdown on so-called tax inversion have hit shares in British pharmaceutical firm Shire, which is trying to hammer out a \u00a331bn deal with US suitor AbbVie. The news comes at a time of intense negotiations ahead of Friday's formal 5pm bid deadline and both sides are likely to seek protective clauses in the agreement in case the deal later falls apart over this issue. AbbVie wants to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal, a move that would cut its effective corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. The Chicago based drug firm is one of a string of US companies looking to redomicile abroad to save billions on tax, most notably Pfizer, whose failed \u00a369bn attempt to buy AstraZeneca in May was partly motivated by the tax savings it could make. But the US treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, urged the leaders of the congressional tax-writing committees to act now to stop US firms redomiciling for tax purposes. He wrote: \"Congress should enact legislation immediately \u2013 and make it retroactive to May 2014 \u2013 to shut down this abuse of our tax system,\" the Wall Street Journal reported. Lew called for comprehensive business tax reform to lower the US corporate tax rate, broaden the tax base, close loopholes and simplify the tax system. Shares in Shire were the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 100 indexclosing down 79p at \u00a347.86, a 1.6% fall. AbbVie, which makes the world's top-selling drug Humira for rheumatoid arthritis, and Shire, known for its hyperactivity treatments, have been in \"detailed talks\" since the board of Shire decided to back AbbVie's latest offer (its fifth) on Monday, despite harbouring doubts over the tax structure. Shire is likely to be pushing for a sizeable reverse break fee in the event the deal collapses. AbbVie, for its part, may want to add a clause that allows both sides to walk away if the US clamps down on tax inversion. It is also taking a closer look at Shire's drug pipeline in light of its forecast that it can double revenues to $10bn by 2020. As both sides have agreed on the price of a deal \u2013 although the mix of the shares-and-cash offer could still change \u2013 the UK Takeover Panel is likely to grant an extension of the deadline if this is requested. Shire's chief executive Flemming Ornskov, who took the reins in January 2013, could land a windfall of up to \u00a321m if the deal goes through at \u00a353.20 a share and all his long term incentive schemes pay out. His predecessor, Angus Russell, owns shares worth \u00a321m in the company, while the former finance director, Graham Hetherington, who left in March, could pocket nearly \u00a330m from his shareholdings and long-term awards. Two days ago, the US drugmaker Mylan clinched a $5.3bn (\u00a33.9bn) deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' generic drugs business in developed markets outside the US, with plans to transfer the assets to a new firm set up in the Netherlands so that Mylan can shift its tax base there. UK baby goods chain Mothercare has rejected two takeover proposals from US rival Destination Maternity, which wants to incorporate the combined business in Britain. Its boss, Ed Krell, described tax savings as the \"icing on the cake\". President Barack Obama included in his latest budget a proposal to ensure that companies cannot change their corporate tax domicile without a change in control of the company itself. About 50 US firms have reincorporated overseas through inversion over the last decade, most of them since 2008. US lawmakers remain divided on the issue. Republicans as well as some influential Democrats in Congress favour a comprehensive overhaul of the tax regime to limit inversions, with some warning that a quick fix could lead to competitive disadvantages for US companies. Even Democratic senator Ron Wyden, who chairs the Senate finance committee and urged in May that \"this [inversion] loophole must be plugged,\" has not pushed for a quick fix. At the weekend, UK business secretary Vince Cable said the government was looking at introducing multimillion-pound fines for foreign firms that break promises on protecting jobs and investment after taking over British businesses. He said the government may go even further and widen the public interest test to offer British companies greater protection against hostile takeovers. AbbVie's approach to Shire has not led to the same job fears as Pfizer's abortive bid for AstraZeneca did.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fears of reform fatigue notwithstanding, the troika\u2019s latest review of the debt-saddled Greek economy was surprisingly low-key \u2013 devoid of massive protest and riots on any real scale worth noting. In the ongoing drama that orbits international surveillance of Greek finances that can only be described as a success. Aides to the newly installed finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, felt fit to call the review \u201cconstructive.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cWe had constructive talks, they wanted to take stock of where we are in terns of the [bailout] program,\u201d one senior finance official was quoted as saying. Mission chiefs representing Greece\u2019s triumphirate of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF return to Athens in September for what will likely be a much more hard-hitting audit.</p> <p>This time, Hardouvelis who joins the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in talks in Brussels this evening, was spared the agonizing task of having to make any decisions. Instead, talks focused on privatizations, structural reforms and what many are calling the increasingly explosive problem of bad bank loans (at the latest count around 40% of total loans). Creditors are fearful that following May\u2019s European elections, which saw the stridently anti-austerity radical left Syriza party trump government forces, the ruling coalition is running our of steam on pressing ahead with reforms. Athens needs to press ahead with a number of them to qualify for its next installment of aid.</p> <p>However, Greece has the ear of the new EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, an ardent philhellene who happens to also have very good relations with Samaras. More than once, Juncker is believed to have rooted for Greece in his former role as head of the eurogroup of finance ministers when fears of a Greek exit from the single currency were at their highest. Juncker\u2019s ardent admiration for Greece is believed to go back to his school days \u2013 and will play a big role in his unwavering support of Athens remaining at the core of the EU.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53c69510e4b00bd3ef823def\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-16T15:07:21.435Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's something which links both Yellen and Murdoch:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/statuses/489420204553031680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Given Yellen&#39;s comments on bubble stocks, ironic Time Warner now being bid for even if Fox&#39;s mooted valuation tag is not eye-watering</p>&mdash; Tony Tassell (@TonyTassell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/statuses/489420204553031680\">July 16, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53c68f16e4b0c03358f50b4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-16T14:41:57.790Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the media world and Rupert Murdoch's tilt at Time Warner, here's an interesting graph:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge/statuses/489417441546489857\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Did Rupert Murdoch Top Tick The Market Again? <a href=\"http://t.co/G9eRQfMwnm\">http://t.co/G9eRQfMwnm</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/mswWJOsyzs\">pic.twitter.com/mswWJOsyzs</a></p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zerohedge/statuses/489417441546489857\">July 16, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53c6869fe4b0c03358f50b3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-16T14:11:37.092Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/15/uk-inflation-data-mark-carney-janet-yellen-business-live#block-53c53331e4b0a5cadf153001\"><b>yesterday's appearance before the Senate</b> </a>by Fed chair Janet Yellen - with the central bank seeming to warn rates could rise earlier (or perhaps later) than people expected and that small cap biotech and social media stocks looked overvalued - she is up before the House of Representatives.</p> <p>And to no-one's surprise (courtesy Reuters):<br></p> <p><i>- Fed chair Yellen's prepared testimony to House of Representatives panel identical to remarks delivered on Tuesday to Senate banking committee.</i></p> <p>But with better than expected housing data from the National Association of Home Builders showing confidence at a six-month high, some believe she may need to tweak her remarks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/statuses/489411074035572736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Maybe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yellen?src=hash\">#Yellen</a> should recast her views on housing as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NAHB?src=hash\">#NAHB</a> rises 4 pts to 53--highest level since January (before weather dampened activity).</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

A bounce back by troubled Portuguese bank Espirito Santo also helped European bourses.The closing scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 74.22 points or 1.11% higher at 6784.67 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 1.44% to 9859.27 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.48% better at 4369.06 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 3.17% higher at 21,069.97 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 1.84% to 10,668.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its record breaking run, and is currently 65 points or 0.38% higher. On that note, it's time to shut up shop. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back to do it all again tomorrow. Over to Greece where mission chiefs representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors have concluded talks with government officials ahead of tonight\u2019s EU summit meeting. Helena Smith reports: Fears of reform fatigue notwithstanding, the troika\u2019s latest review of the debt-saddled Greek economy was surprisingly low-key \u2013 devoid of massive protest and riots on any real scale worth noting. In the ongoing drama that orbits international surveillance of Greek finances that can only be described as a success. Aides to the newly installed finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, felt fit to call the review \u201cconstructive.\u201d \u201cWe had constructive talks, they wanted to take stock of where we are in terns of the [bailout] program,\u201d one senior finance official was quoted as saying. Mission chiefs representing Greece\u2019s triumphirate of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF return to Athens in September for what will likely be a much more hard-hitting audit. This time, Hardouvelis who joins the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in talks in Brussels this evening, was spared the agonizing task of having to make any decisions. Instead, talks focused on privatizations, structural reforms and what many are calling the increasingly explosive problem of bad bank loans (at the latest count around 40% of total loans). Creditors are fearful that following May\u2019s European elections, which saw the stridently anti-austerity radical left Syriza party trump government forces, the ruling coalition is running our of steam on pressing ahead with reforms. Athens needs to press ahead with a number of them to qualify for its next installment of aid. However, Greece has the ear of the new EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, an ardent philhellene who happens to also have very good relations with Samaras. More than once, Juncker is believed to have rooted for Greece in his former role as head of the eurogroup of finance ministers when fears of a Greek exit from the single currency were at their highest. Juncker\u2019s ardent admiration for Greece is believed to go back to his school days \u2013 and will play a big role in his unwavering support of Athens remaining at the core of the EU. Here's something which links both Yellen and Murdoch: Back with the media world and Rupert Murdoch's tilt at Time Warner, here's an interesting graph: After yesterday's appearance before the Senate by Fed chair Janet Yellen - with the central bank seeming to warn rates could rise earlier (or perhaps later) than people expected and that small cap biotech and social media stocks looked overvalued - she is up before the House of Representatives. And to no-one's surprise (courtesy Reuters): - Fed chair Yellen's prepared testimony to House of Representatives panel identical to remarks delivered on Tuesday to Senate banking committee. But with better than expected housing data from the National Association of Home Builders showing confidence at a six-month high, some believe she may need to tweak her remarks: Here is the full statement from Time Warner rejecting the Fox bid. And here are its main reasons: The execution of Time Warner\u2019s strategic plan will continue to drive significant and sustainable value for Time Warner stockholders; The unique value of Time Warner\u2019s industry-leading businesses including its portfolio of networks and its film studio and television production business is only going to increase; There is significant risk and uncertainty as to the valuation of Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s non-voting stock and Twenty-First Century Fox\u2019s ability to govern and manage a combination of the size and scale of Twenty-First Century Fox and Time Warner; and There are considerable strategic, operational, and regulatory risks to executing a combination with Twenty-First Century Fox. Time Warner shares have opened up 15% following the Fox takeover approach. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is around 70 points higher in early trading, a new record high (inevitably). Away from the world of mighty media mega mergers for a moment, and back to shareholders kicking up a fuss about pay. More than 25% of investors at FirstGroup voted against the company's remuneration report, before counting abstentions. Including those it was closer to 31%. And 11% of those voting failed to back the company's remuneration policy. FirstGroup of course is also unpopular with commuters who suffer its rail services and recently lost the Thameslink franchise. And here's confirmation of Time Warner's response to the Fox bid: Here's our early take on the news that Rupert Murdoch has tried to pull another mega-merger: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s $80bn Time Warner bid rebuffed And Wall Street will give its verdict in around half an hour, when trading begins. Time Warner share are expected to surge, in anticipation that Fox won't give up its pursuit..... So that a good moment to hand over to Nick Fletcher... GW That was quick. 21st Century Fox has now issued a statement confirming that it had, indeed, made an approach to Time Warner in June, but was rebuffed: \u201c21st Century Fox can confirm that we made a formal proposal to Time Warner last month to combine the two companies. The Time Warner Board of Directors declined to pursue our proposal. We are not currently in any discussions with Time Warner.\" 21st Century Fox Confirms Proposal to Combine with Time Warner Inc. Shares in Time Warner have jumped 12% in pre-market trading, following a report that it has turned down an $80bn takeover offer from media magnate Rupert Murdoch. The New York Times's Dealbook sent Wall Street into a spin this morning, reporting that: Twenty-First Century Fox, the media empire run by Rupert Murdoch, made an $80 billion takeover bid in recent weeks for Time Warner but was rebuffed, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The bold approach could put Time Warner in play and might again ignite a reshaping of the media industry, prompting a new spate of mega-mergers among the nation\u2019s largest entertainment companies. Rupert Murdoch Said to Have Made Offer for Time Warner Twitter is agog: In other news, there's been a decent-sized shareholder rebellion at Experian, the card-checking company. Almost one in three investors failed to back the election of the chairman, Don Robert, in protest at the decision to elevate Robert from the chief executive's chair. As my colleague Jill Treanor explains, it means outgoing chairman Sir John Peace has been rebuked by investors three times this summer alone: Sir John Peace suffers hat-trick of shareholder revolts Here's our news story on today's labour market statistics: Rising employment fails again to boost wages And here's a round-up of analyst reaction: Unemployment figures - what the economists say The Resolution Foundation also flags up that two records have been set in a single day, as Britain's \"job-rich, wage-poor recovery\" continued. As I explained earlier, the employment rate has matched its historic high (see 9.52am). but wage growth of 0.7% in the March to May quarter is the weakest in at least 12 years. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, warned that wages probably suffered last month too: \u201cThe closing of the jobs gap marks a key point in the economic recovery and the continued strong rebound in employment should be celebrated. But the pay squeeze shows no signs of coming to end just yet, reinforcing the sense that we are in the midst of a jobs-rich but wage-poor recovery. \u201cSome slow-down in wage growth was expected, but this fall is much sharper than most would have predicted. With yesterday\u2019s inflation figures rising to 1.9%, the chances are that we\u2019ll see a further fall in pay with next month\u2019s figures too.\u201d Over in Parliament, David Cameron and Ed Miliband have clashed over today's unemployment data. Cameron hailed the rise in employment, saying the UK has reached an \"important milestone\" with more people in work than ever before. And long-term youth unemployment is lower than before the start of this parliament. It's disappointing that pay isn't rising faster, but it's a consequence of the financial crisis and the deep recession suffered by the UK, the prime minister added. The Labour leader, though, seized on the record low pay increases. The recovery is not helping millions of ordinary people, Miliband warned, who are \"working harder for longer for less\". My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering PMQs in detail here: Cameron and Miliband at PMQs: Politics live blog Although the pay rise figures are bad, the true situation is probably even worse. The Resolution Foundation points out that the average weekly earnings take no account of the UK\u2019s 4.6 million self-employed. It calculated earlier this month that if self-employed income was included, the squeeze on wages since 2008 would be \"more than 20 per cent deeper than the official figures suggest\". It's not just union leaders who are worried about the quality of new jobs being created in the UK. Anthony Harmer, chief executive of ELATT (East London Advanced Technology Training), says the key is to get more people into work experience and apprenticeships: \u201cToday's figures highlight the important progress that is being made to help people find work. However, whilst there is an increasing number of people in employment, many remain in low pay or part time positions. More work doesn\u2019t yet mean better work. Ordinary people are working harder and getting poorer, warns that Unite union. It says that the weak pay growth shows many people aren't benefiting from the recovery, echoing the concerns raised by the TUC (at 10.31am). Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary said inflation is \"vastly\" outstripping wage rises. \"Falling unemployment is welcome, but now is not the time to pop the champagne open. Behind these figures is a story of rising insecurity as self-employment soars to record levels while the assault on living standards continues as wages lag behind inflation. \"For many any sense of an economic recovery is simply passing them by as this government fosters a low paid, low skilled economy built on the back of precarious employment. We must always remember that the growing number of self-employed have no rights or protections, let alone a stable income. McCluskey urged the Bank of England to consider this when deciding whether to raise interest rates: Too many people are living pay cheque to pay cheque and there is simply not the slack for additional demands on their incomes.\" Alan Clarke, economist at Scotia, says the weak earnings growth is a worrying sign: Underlying wage inflation of 0.7% and inflation of 1.9% y/y adds up to very negative real income growth - not good for the prospects of consumption growth when the sugar rush from housing runs out of steam. The pay statistics are distorted because companies held back bonus payments a year ago, until the top rate of tax fell from 50% to 45% in April 2013. That's why the total pay is up just +0.3 year-on-year, and why I've been using the regular pay (ex-bonuses) figure of +0.7% instead. James Knightley of ING reckons the bonus distortion will fade, meaning real wages could start rising before the year is out. We suspect wages will be pushing back up to 2-2.5% YoY towards the end of the year, especially with the minimum wage rising 3% in October. Britain's wages packets haven't been squeezed so tightly in at least 150 years, flags up Ed Conway of Sky: The latest UK labour market data continue to show \"an unusual mixture of strong employment growth but stagnant wages\", says Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics. Economists are puzzled as to why the UK economy has become less productive since the crisis. But there's no doubt it has happened. Today's report shows that the total number of hours worked in the UK is up by 7.6% over the last five years, to 69.4 million. But the economy only just back to its pre-crisis peak: Ben Brettell, Hargreaves Lansdown Senior Economist, comments: GDP is now broadly the same as it was before the financial crisis, but employing a significantly higher number of workers to produce that output. This is clear indication that slack in the labour market remains \u2013 I believe the Bank of England will want to see hard evidence that this spare capacity has been absorbed before considering higher interest rates.\u201d Unions are alarmed to see that UK pay growth hit a record low (going back to 2001) of 0.7% in the three months to May. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it shows that many of the new jobs being created are of low-quality, and low productivity: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see unemployment falling, but with pay growth falling to a record low, serious questions must be asked about the quality of jobs being created in Britain today. \u201cIf all the recovery can deliver is low-paid, low-productivity jobs \u2013 many of which don\u2019t offer enough hours to get by \u2013 then it will pass most working people by and Britain\u2019s long-term economic prospects will be seriously diminished.\u201d Today's unemployment data does include signs that Britain's labour market has improved. More people are in work (although many are self-employed), hitting a record high of 30.64m the number of unemployed people is down by another 121,000, pushing the rate to 6.5%, the lowest since October-December 2008 and the claimant count has fallen sharply again too, down by 36,300 in June alone. But Britain's workers simply aren't feeling the benefits -- indeed, the pay squeeze has worsened, with regular pay up just 0.7% annually in March-May. That's the lowest in at least 12 years. With inflation running around 1.6% during the quarter, that means real wages shrank by 0.9% -- continuing a trend that began six years ago: And here's the proof that the average UK family has been suffering falling real wages (pay minus inflation) since the financial crisis began: The prime minister isn't dwelling on the weakest rise in regular pay in over a decade: Here's another stat: the number of people in employment is up by 929,000 over the last 12 months - the largest rise in over 40 years. If you look at the unemployment data for May alone, you can see that the jobless rate fell to just 6.2%. Chris Giles of the FT tweets the chart: And this chart shows how the slump in regular pay growth means real wages shrank again in the three months to May: The employment rate has equalled its record high, of 73.1%, last set in the quarter to February 2005. Since records began in 1971, it has never been higher, the ONS says. The number of people in work hit a new record high of 30.64 million. But a sizeable chunk of that is people becoming self-employed. The ONS reports: The number of employees increased by 552,000 to reach 25.83 million. The number of self-employed people increased by 404,000 to reach 4.58 million. But the earnings figures are a shocker, showing that real wages are still shrinking. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by just 0.7% annually in the three months to May. That's the slowest rate since the Office for National Statistics started measuring it 13 years ago. Inflation over the same period was around 1.6%. The ONS says: For March to May 2014, regular pay for employees in Great Britain was 0.7% higher than a year earlier. This was the lowest annual growth rate since records begin in 2001 and reflects low pay growth across a wide range of industrial sectors. That strips out the impact of companies shifting bonus payments a year ago to profit from the cut in the top rate of tax. If you include bonuses, pay was up by a measly 0.3%. There are encouraging signs that the UK labour market is recovering: The number of people out of work is fell by 121,000 in the three months to May. And the Claimant Count, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit, dipped by 36,300 in June. May's figure has also been revised to show more people stopped claiming JOoseeker's allowance in that month too. Here we go! The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 6.5% in the three months to May, the lowest since the last quarter of 2008. Nearly time for the UK jobs data to be released. A reminder: Economists expect to see another rise in the employment total in the three months to May, to a fresh record high around 30.589m. This could pull the unemployment total down from last month's 6.6%, to 6.5%. And the claimant count could also fall again. IHS Global Insight expects a fall of 27,000 in June, to a 68-month low of 1.10590 million. But earnings figures are unlikely to match inflation. Royal Mail could be fined a maximum of \u00a3160m if French authorities conclude it broke antitrust rules, reckon analysts at Espirito Santo. They told clients: \"French antitrust law permits a maximum fine of 10 percent of worldwide turnover,\" \"This would lead to a worst-case scenario of around a \u00a3160m pound fine for Royal Mail (10 percent of GLS revenue) and about a \u20ac670 fine for TNT Express (group revenue of 6.7 billion euros).\" Typically, antitrust penalties rarely reach this maximum level, though. Last year, Royal Mail reported operating profits of \u00a3671m. Royal Mail isn't the only company hit by the French antitrust inquiry - shares in Dutch postal operator TNT are down 3.3% this morning. JP Morgan has hiked its forecast for China's growth this year, on the back of this morning's GDP figures: Nick Bubb, retail analyst, reckons Mike Ashley pulled out of the Sports Direct bonus scheme after realising he'd get too much of the pie. If staff learned they'd been \"squeezed out\" by their billionaire boss, morale would suffer. \"Plenty of people thought Mike Ashley shouldn\u2019t need any more motivation, given his huge shareholding in the company, so presumably that is what will keep him going from now on... For example, a 10p dividend would generate him income of well over \u00a330m, which would keep the wolf from the door.\" Here's our full story: Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley leaves controversial bonus scheme Mike Ashley, the billionaire boss of Sports Direct (and owner of Newcastle United), never ceases to amaze me. The company has revealed this morning that Ashley has decided he doesn't want to take part in its 2015 bonus scheme, just two weeks after cajoling shareholders to accept it. The plan was controversial as it wasn't clear how much of the \u00a3180m package would go to Ashley, and how much to staff. Keith Hellawell, non-executive chairman, told the City: Following recent unhelpful speculation surrounding his potential allocation, he [Ashley] is determined to ensure that there is the maximum number of shares available for the eligible employees. So is Ashley simply playing games with the City again? Or has the threat of a shareholder rebellion against the board (as reported by the Guardian two weeks ago) prompted an about-turn? Ashley owns rather more than half of Sports Direct -- so frankly it was never clear that the bonus would make him work harder. Maybe he just wanted to feel appreciated.... This antitrust probe into the French postal service has been running for four years, but the City didn't realise until now that Royal Mail's French parcel delivery firm could suffer 'material' losses Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says the probe has put Royal Mail shares under the cosh: While still early days, and linked to a broader investigation into the French postal industry which dates back to 2010 (Dutch group TNT has been assisting all along) this could weigh on the shares in the short term, hampering recovery of the recently lost ground. The statement this morning that fines/ losses could be material sounds ominous but likely just cautious at such an early stage, but after all the talk of the group being sold off too cheap last October it just goes to show that even previously nationalized entities (still 30% government owned) aren\u2019t whiter than white and represent risks to investors. Shares in Royal Mail have slid 1.7%, after the recently privatised postal operator's French subsidiary was accused of breaching competition rules. Royal Mail warned the City this morning that the French competition authority, Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, has claimed that its GLS France division has broken antitrust laws. It told shareholders: This is in connection with a broader investigation into alleged activities within the industry in France. We are currently considering the notice received from the French regulator. Given the early stage of this matter, we cannot yet determine the amount or range of potential loss; however, it is possible that it could be material. This knocked 8.3p off Royal Mail's share price, to 480p. Chinese GDP rises 7.5% European stock markets have been cheered by the news that China's economy beat forecasts, by growing at an annual rate of 7.5%. Economists had expected a growth rate of 7.4%. The FTSE 100 rose 30 points, or 0.45%, at the start of trading, and the French, Italian, and Spanish markets all rose by 0.5%. Investors were also encouraged that Chinese retail sales rose 12.1% year on year, and industrial production gained 9.2%. But as Reuters explains, there are still fears over China's property market, where prices have now begun falling.... The data confirmed the Asian giant had stabilised after a shaky start to the year but still left the global outlook cloudy, particularly given recent weakness in the eurozone. \"The GDP figure is in line with our expectation, but the underlying momentum and recovery is still at a fragile state, especially given the property market correction,\" said Chang Jian, an analyst at Barclays based in Hong Kong. \"The recovery is quite dependent on the government support.\" James Knightley of ING reckons we'll see a \"strong\" labour report at 9.30am, with more people joining the UK workforce. We should get more evidence of this today with a strong labour report. We look for another 250,000+ reading for the 3M change in employment with the unemployment rate dropping to 6.5%. Knightley also reckons real wages will pick up later this year: Wages are likely to be disappointingly weak, but this reflects payment timing adjustments relating to tax changes last year* and so they should drop out of the equation in a couple of months. Indeed, we suspect wages will be pushing back up to 2- 2.5% YoY towards the end of the year, especially with the minimum wage rising 3% in October. * - the reduction in the top rate of tax to 45%, which led some companies to delay paying bonuses. And Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons pay may have picked up in May: We see underlying annual earnings growth actually picking up to 1.3% in May itself after relapsing to just 0.4% in April itself from 1.0% in March, 1.2% in February and 1.7% in January. But that would still be below May's inflation rate of 1.5% -- meaning falling real wages. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Has Britain's labour market continued to recover, and are people feeling the benefits of the recovery in their pockets? We find out this morning, when the latest unemployment data is released by the Office for National Statistics (at 9.30am). Economists predict that the UK unemployment rate could fall again, from 6.6% to 6.5%, and that the claimant count will drop by perhaps 27,000. That's the good news. The bad news is that wages are unlikely to have picked up significantly, meaning real pay packets (adjusted for inflation) will still be falling. Last month's data showed wages rose by a meagre 0.7% year-on-year in February-April. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets fears income growth may actually have slowed, in the three months to May: Today's average earnings data for May is expected to show a further drop from the 0.7% seen in April to 0.5%, widening the gap further. The figures could be better if you strip out bonuses, but it's unlikely to show the cost of living crisis easing. We'll find out in two hours time.... What else is coming up today? Overnight, we've seen that the Chinese economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter, at a rate of 7.5%. Encouraging news for the global economy, but also suggesting Beijing may not be as generous with its stimulus measures (I'll post a wire story with the details shortly). European leaders will be gathering for an European Council meeting in Brussels today, and Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is expected to grab the ear of president Juncker. There could be shareholder revolts today; Experian, Severn Trent, First Group and BT are all holding their annual general meetings. Janet Yellen will be testifying to Congress again, but that's likely to be a re-run of yesterday's session. And we'll also be keeping an eye on Portugal's Esp\u00edrito Santo.....",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment fell last month as Britain's economy added jobs at an unprecedented pace, according to official figures. But the recovery failed to lift wages by more than a fraction, leaving workers suffering another real-terms cut in living standards. The jobless rate fell to 6.5% of the workforce, while the number of people in work edged higher to a fresh record of 30.6 million. The proportion of those aged 16 to 64 in work reached 73.1% in the three months to May, a rate only equalled before in 2004-5 and in 1974. But a 0.7% rise in wages, excluding bonuses, was well short of the 1.5% May inflation rate. With bonuses factored in, wage growth was only 0.3%. Average wage rises have remained stubbornly below inflation during the recovery and forecasters have repeatedly predicted an imminent return to above-inflation rises in wages over the last year only for each month's official figures to prove them wrong. A rise in inflation last month to 1.9% and the fall in total average wage increases from 0.8% to 0.3% appeared to show the situation worsening. The Office for National Statistics argued that the cut in the 50p top rate of tax to 45p last year prompted people to delay their bonus payments, making comparisons difficult. However, as the 0.7% rise in regular pay shows, the decline in real wages is only alleviated a little when bonuses are excluded. Peter Patterson, deputy chief economist at the ONS, said: \"The striking divergence between employment and pay continues. While the employment rate has never been higher, the average weekly earnings of employees excluding bonuses have risen by only 0.7% over the past year.\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said many of the new jobs being created are of low quality, and low productivity: \"It's good to see unemployment falling, but with pay growth falling to a record low, serious questions must be asked about the quality of jobs being created in Britain today. \"If all the recovery can deliver is low-paid, low-productivity jobs \u2013 many of which don't offer enough hours to get by \u2013 then it will pass most working people by and Britain's long-term economic prospects will be seriously diminished.\" A survey of household finances by the financial data provider Markit painted an equally gloomy picture with people reporting their perception of their overall financial wellbeing falling. The survey firm's household finances index stands at a six-month low, with households on the lowest incomes the most fearful of a worsening outlook for family budgets. James Knightley of ING said he supported the ONS view that distortions last year were artificially depressing official wage growth figures and they would soon return to around 2-2.5%, which he believes is the experience of most workers. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the Bank of England was likely to remain concerned about below-inflation wages growth. He said: \"Following on from the rise in consumer price inflation to 1.9% in June, the further marked drop in unemployment will likely fuel expectations that the Bank of England will be raising interest rates before the end of 2014. \"However, ongoing very low earnings growth and some recent signs that growth could be losing momentum (a marked relapse in industrial production and construction output in May as well as a soft BRC retail sales survey for June) highlights the fact that any interest rate hike this year is far from a done deal,\" he added. Unemployment fell 121,000 to 2.12 million people in the three months to May, the lowest since October 2008. The number of people who left the unemployment register over the last year hit 383,000, while the workforce was swelled by 929,000 people. Economists said women were returning to work, migrant professionals were taking up jobs in London and the south-east, and there was a steady rise in self-employment. Job vacancies were at a post financial crash high of 648,000, which some employers groups say indicates a growing problem of skill shortages. However, the vacancy total remains well short of the 900,000 pre-crash level. Unemployment fell in all regions bar the north-east, which recorded a rise of 5,000 to 129,000. This left the region with an unemployment rate of 9.6%, the highest in the UK. Minister for employment, Esther McVey, said: \"An important milestone has been reached in our country's recovery. With one of the highest employment rates ever, it's clear that the government's long-term economic plan to help businesses create jobs and get people working again is the right one. \"With an employment rate which has never been higher, record women in work and more young people in jobs, the resilience of the country during the downturn is being rewarded. We know there is more to do, and the best way to do so is to go on delivering a plan that's creating growth.\"",

    "webTitle": "Sir John Peace suffers latest shareholder revolt at Experian", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Serial boardroom director Sir John Peace is under pressure after facing a hat-trick of shareholder rebellions at the three FTSE 100 firms he chairs. Following his recent embarrassments with revolts over pay at high fashion retailer Burberry and Standard Chartered bank, investors in Experian vented their anger over succession planning at the credit-checking company. After Peace had chaired his last annual meeting of Experian \u2013 the company he founded more than 30 years ago \u2013 it was announced that 30% of investors had failed to support the election to the board of his successor, Don Robert. The revolt by nearly one in three investors came after the intervention of the Institute of Directors, which warned that Robert's appointment to chairman breached City codes stipulating that chief executives should not jeopardise the independent oversight of the board by stepping up to the crucial role of chairman. It came on a day when other top companies also faced dissent from investors. At Icap, the interdealer broker run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, nearly 33% of investors showed their anger over pay by voting against the remuneration report while at Aberdeen-based transport company First Group 25% of shareholders voted against pay deals for its boss, Tim O'Toole. The revolts come amid heightened scrutiny of pay at leading companies after business secretary Vince Cable gave shareholders a new vote on future pay deals for bosses. At Standard Chartered, 41% of investors voted against pay deals for the management team while at Burberry, almost 53% of investors cast a non-binding vote last week against the pay report. At Experian the focus had been on succession planning and while just a handful of investors attended the annual meeting in Dublin, the drama came in votes that had been cast before the meeting by institutional investors. About 11% of investors voted against Robert's re-election to the board but the level of opposition rose to 30% if deliberate abstentions are included. Company directors usually expect a much more solid endorsement by their shareholders, as was the case for the other directors on the Experian board who were elected with about 98% support. Robert has been chief executive of Experian since it was spun out of GUS in 2006 and floated on the stock market. He has received \u00a345m over five years and there was also a smaller revolt over pay after 15% of investors failed to support the remuneration report. He took up his new post as chairman after the annual meeting where he paid tribute to his predecessor's \"foresight, leadership and determination\". But shareholders said they were frustrated by Peace's oversight of the companies he continued to chair. One said: \"He has a reputation of being difficult and is not helping to foster good relationships between the companies' management and major shareholders\". Experian focused on the 90% of votes cast in favour of Robert's re-election rather than the level of dissent. \"As chairman, Don brings considerable value to Experian and has unrivalled, deep knowledge of the business which he has built up over nine highly successful years as chief executive officer. The board places enormous value on Don remaining with the business, particularly given the retirement of founder Sir John Peace,\" the company said. \"We endeavour to listen carefully to our shareholders and are always happy to engage with any investors on this or any other resolution that was put to today's meeting.\" Investor advisory bodies such as the Investment Management Association had warned about the breaches of corporate governance codes, issuing an \"amber top\" alert before the annual meeting to signal potential concerns. An amber top is its second highest warning. It is thought that investor bodies were also concerned about the bonuses at money broker Icap \u2013 which was fined \u00a355m in September for rigging Libor \u2013 as there is no upper limit on the amount that can be paid out. At the annual meeting in the London headquarters of the broker, chairman Charles Gregson told shareholders: \"Our remuneration policy is historical, the process is changing and during this coming year we will be consulting with shareholders on a new design of the policy in 2016.\" At First Group, Wednesday's rebellion was less strong than the 30% vote against pay policies in 2013. \"Imelda Walsh, the newly appointed chair of our remuneration committee, will engage with investors to seek their views and ensure ongoing support for the group's remuneration policy and practices,\" a First Group spokesman said.",

At Icap, the interdealer broker run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, <a href=\"http://www.icap.com/~/media/Files/I/Icap-Corp/pdfs/2014-07-16-Proxy-Results-.pdf\" title=\"\">nearly 33% of investors showed their anger over pay by voting against the remuneration report</a> while at Aberdeen-based transport company First Group <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/firstgroup-plc--fgp-/prn/result-of-agm/20140716135612PE118/\" title=\"\">25% of shareholders voted against</a> pay deals for its boss, Tim O'Toole.</p> <p>The revolts come amid heightened scrutiny of pay at leading companies after business secretary Vince Cable gave shareholders a new vote on future pay deals for bosses.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/18/standard-chartered-pressure-executive-pay-investor-revolt\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered, 41% of investors voted against pay deals for the management team</a> while at<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/11/burberry-shareholders-revolt-christian-bailey-pay-package\" title=\"\"> Burberry, almost 53% of investors cast a non-binding vote last week against the pay report.</a></p> <p>At Experian the focus had been on succession planning and while just a handful of investors attended the annual meeting in Dublin, the drama came in votes that had been cast before the meeting by institutional investors.</p> <p>About 11% of investors voted against Robert's re-election to the board but the level of opposition rose to 30% if deliberate abstentions are included. Company directors usually expect a much more solid endorsement by their shareholders, as was the case for the other directors on the Experian board who were elected with about 98% support.</p> <p>Robert has been chief executive of Experian since it was spun out of GUS in 2006 and floated on the stock market. He has received \u00a345m over five years and there was also a smaller revolt over pay after 15% of investors failed to support the remuneration report.</p> <p>He took up his new post as chairman after the annual meeting where he paid tribute to his predecessor's \"foresight, leadership and determination\".</p> <p>But shareholders said they were frustrated by Peace's oversight of the companies he continued to chair. One said: \"He has a reputation of being difficult and is not helping to foster good relationships between the companies' management and major shareholders\".</p> <p>Experian focused on the 90% of votes cast in favour of Robert's re-election rather than the level of dissent. \"As chairman, Don brings considerable value to Experian and has unrivalled, deep knowledge of the business which he has built up over nine highly successful years as chief executive officer. The board places enormous value on Don remaining with the business, particularly given the retirement of founder Sir John Peace,\" <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/experian-plc--expn-/rns/agm-statement/201407161224464993M/\" title=\"\">the company said</a>.</p> <p>\"We endeavour to listen carefully to our shareholders and are always happy to engage with any investors on this or any other resolution that was put to today's meeting.\"</p> <p>Investor advisory bodies such as the Investment Management Association had warned about the breaches of corporate governance codes, issuing an \"amber top\" alert before the annual meeting to signal potential concerns. An amber top is its second highest warning.</p> <p>It is thought that investor bodies were also concerned about the bonuses at money broker Icap \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/25/icap-fined-55m-pounds-libor-rigging-charges-former-staff\" title=\"\">which was fined \u00a355m in September for rigging Libor</a> \u2013 as there is no upper limit on the amount that can be paid out. At the annual meeting in the London headquarters of the broker, chairman Charles Gregson told shareholders: \"Our remuneration policy is historical, the process is changing and during this coming year we will be consulting with shareholders on a new design of the policy in 2016.\"</p> <p>At First Group, Wednesday's rebellion was less strong than the 30% vote against pay policies in 2013. \"Imelda Walsh, the newly appointed chair of our remuneration committee, will engage with investors to seek their views and ensure ongoing support for the group's remuneration policy and practices,\" a First Group spokesman said.</p>",

There had been concerns that Intel would be gaining market share in Arm's key area of mobile technology, while Arm's attempts to enter the server market could prove problematic. But Intel's results painted a more favourable picture to Arm. FinnCap analyst Lorne Daniel moved from hold to buy with a \u00a310 target, saying:</p> <blockquote> [Arm's] share price is taking a traditional mid-summer dip, helped on its way by fears of a revival in the fortunes of rival Intel.

      "bodyText": "With leading shares lifted by a mixture of good Chinese data and bid talk, one of the biggest risers is Arm following an update from US rival Intel. Ahead of its results next week, the chip designer has added 21.5p to 855p. There had been concerns that Intel would be gaining market share in Arm's key area of mobile technology, while Arm's attempts to enter the server market could prove problematic. But Intel's results painted a more favourable picture to Arm. FinnCap analyst Lorne Daniel moved from hold to buy with a \u00a310 target, saying: [Arm's] share price is taking a traditional mid-summer dip, helped on its way by fears of a revival in the fortunes of rival Intel. However, Intel's second quarter results show that while its PC market has had a bounce, its mobile unit continues to haemorrhage cash and Intel's focus on gaining traction in tablets leaves the higher volume smartphone market still safely in the hands of its Cambridge-based rival. Earnings look relatively secure and a 35 times forward PE is cheap for Arm. Rival Imagination Technologies is also gaining ground, up 6.9p at 205.5p. Elsewhere Meggitt is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, adding 46.9p to 537p after a report that US group United Technologies could be planning a 635p cash bid for the engineer. Meanwhile easyJet has added 39p to \u00a313.16 as Goldman Sachs repeated its conviction buy rating, although the bank did cut its target price from \u00a321.05 to \u00a320.10. Mining shares were supported by the latest Chinese data, which showed a 7.5% annual rate of GDP growth compared to expectations of 7.4%. Rio Tinto has risen 53p to 3297.5p while BHP Billiton is 16p better at \u00a320.08. Rio also announced a 23% rise in second quarter iron ore shipments. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 47.24 points higher at 6757.69, as the UK unemployment rate fell to an expected 6.5% in the three months to May. Among the fallers, Royal Mail is down 6.1p at 482.6p after being caught up in a French competition investigation which could lead to a fine. Imperial Tobacco - which agreed a deal to buy $7.1bn worth of assets from the soon-to-be-merged Reynolds and Lorillard - has lost 43p to \u00a325.95 as its shares went ex-dividend.",

      "bodyText": "When Luke Hook finally agreed after six months' unemployment to take a placement at the Port of Tilbury, he was only grudgingly doing it to oblige the job centre. As the recovery boosted jobs in the economy but appeared to leave young people largely behind \u2013 a pattern expected to continue in Wednesday's unemployment figures \u2013 the 18-year-old had been holding out for paid work rather than an internship. But he could have faced losing unemployment benefits if he had refused. Now, a few months on, he is a paid apprentice at the busy river Thames port and says the traineeship has helped him where school failed. \"With the atmosphere of school and the way they treat you, you don't feel like you are getting somewhere. Here they treat you like an adult, they are trying to push you forwards,,\" he says. A fellow apprentice, Conner Bragg, has just come off a night shift. The 19-year-old took a traineeship there after asking his job centre about where he could get a forklift truck licence. Bragg was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia as a child and says he struggled at school. Having mentors and practical work at the port has suited him better, he says. \"Give me an exam and I will fail it, but ask me questions and I can answer them.\" He wants to finish the apprenticeship and work his way up at the port, where 800 employees work across a range of jobs from controlling huge cranes to managing its renewable power supply. Both teenagers are among the UK's first cohort of young people on the government's new traineeship scheme \u2013 a training programme with work experience to help get young jobseekers \"work ready\". With more than a million young people not in education, employment or training \u2013 the so-called Neets \u2013 the coalition came up with traineeships last year. The government-funded programmes last up to five months, with businesses providing work experience placements while training organisations help run classes in English and maths and teach skills like timekeeping. Trainees keep their Jobseeker's Allowance while on the scheme. Trade unions have expressed concerns that traineeships must not become a way of hiring young people for unpaid work or push paid workers out of their jobs. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has created a \"model traineeships charter\" to help unions negotiate for high-quality traineeships. \"We are supportive of traineeships but we think there need to be safeguards in place to ensure young people are not being exploited,\" says Iain Murray, senior policy officer at the TUC. Matthew Hancock, the former skills minister now promoted to business, enterprise and energy, says traineeships are an important stepping stone for young people who are \"within six months of getting a good job\". They came out of a drive to raise the quality of apprenticeships, which in isolation would have left some school leavers behind. \"That would have left a gap for people who need support to get to the position where they can hold down a sustainable job or apprenticeship. So we developed traineeships,\" says Hancock, who took on a trainee in his own parliamentary office. \"It is all about building ladders of opportunity so people can climb from traineeship to apprenticeship, which ultimately can now lead to degree-level qualifications.\" At the latest count, three-quarters of the way through the academic year, there were 7,400 trainee starts, and the scheme has signed up some big employers, including the BBC, BT, Jaguar Land Rover and Virgin Media. It is a small dent in the youth unemployment figures, which have improved slightly in recent months but remain far worse than for the population as a whole. The jobless rate of 18.5% for 16- to 24-year-olds is several times the UK's overall unemployment rate of 6.6%. There are still 975,000 Neets. But Hancock is pleased with progress on traineeships, given that he hoped to reach 10,000 young people in this first academic year. He says there is already anecdotal evidence that a high proportion are staying on and getting jobs. At carmaker Nissan, 80% of trainees are progressing to a job or apprenticeship, he adds. Now he wants to see more companies supporting the scheme. But opinions from businesses themselves are mixed. The National Apprenticeship Service recently published an ICM poll of employers where less than half \u2013 43% \u2013 said they believed it was their duty to help develop the next generation of the workforce. Simon Harper, training and development manager at the Port of Tilbury, says when other employers ask him about traineeships, he recommends them but paints a \"warts and all\" picture. \"It's tough, it's hard work,\" says Harper, who has 21 trainees and hopes to reach 60 by the end of the year. \"We have had quite a few who have come through who have learning needs, who have trouble engaging with the outside world and we look after them.\" But he stresses that the benefits of getting young people into the port's ageing workforce outweigh the investment. \"What used to happen was you would have sons, daughters, nephews all working together. The port has always had jobs and people would walk into it. But now we need people with education, which is why we do traineeships and apprenticeships. Gone are the days when we heaped sacks across our backs and loaded them on and off ships ... the work is a lot more technical now,\" he says. Tilbury is the biggest paper-handling port in the UK, taking delivery of thousands of tonnes of paper from the Baltic states and a large proportion of the UK's newsprint. The drab, grey, two-storey training centre was once the logistics centre for the London Olympics, overseeing the arrival of millions of pieces of sports equipment from around the world. \"There's a variety between the jobs. It's whatever you are best at,\" says Hook. \"You get to see how everything works, how it comes into this country.\" Hook completed the traineeship but others dropped out, particularly when offered paid work. Harper would like to see a safety net for those struggling to survive on benefits during their work experience. \"We have had people drop out because of the short-term need to earn,\" he says. But overall he is optimistic about the scheme. \"If you had a programme of five people and two stayed on, that's still a win for us because we have got young people into our business.\"",

He says there is already anecdotal evidence that a high proportion are staying on and getting jobs. At carmaker Nissan, 80% of trainees are progressing to a job or apprenticeship, he adds. Now he wants to see more companies supporting the scheme.</p> <p>But opinions from businesses themselves are mixed. The <a href=\"http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Apprenticeship Service</a> recently published <a href=\"http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/news-media/latest-news/article423.aspx\" title=\"\">an ICM poll of employers</a> where less than half \u2013 43% \u2013 said they believed it was their duty to help develop the next generation of the workforce.</p> <p>Simon Harper, training and development manager at the Port of Tilbury, says when other employers ask him about traineeships, he recommends them but paints a \"warts and all\" picture.</p> <p>\"It's tough, it's hard work,\" says Harper, who has 21 trainees and hopes to reach 60 by the end of the year. \"We have had quite a few who have come through who have learning needs, who have trouble engaging with the outside world and we look after them.\"</p> <p>But he stresses that the benefits of getting young people into the port's ageing workforce outweigh the investment.</p> <p>\"What used to happen was you would have sons, daughters, nephews all working together. The port has always had jobs and people would walk into it. But now we need people with education, which is why we do traineeships and apprenticeships. Gone are the days when we heaped sacks across our backs and loaded them on and off ships ... the work is a lot more technical now,\" he says.</p> <p>Tilbury is the biggest paper-handling port in the UK, taking delivery of thousands of tonnes of paper from the Baltic states and a large proportion of the UK's newsprint. The drab, grey, two-storey training centre was once the logistics centre for the London Olympics, overseeing the arrival of millions of pieces of sports equipment from around the world.</p> <p>\"There's a variety between the jobs. It's whatever you are best at,\" says Hook. \"You get to see how everything works, how it comes into this country.\"</p> <p>Hook completed the traineeship but others dropped out, particularly when offered paid work. Harper would like to see a safety net for those struggling to survive on benefits during their work experience. \"We have had people drop out because of the short-term need to earn,\" he says.</p> <p>But overall he is optimistic about the scheme. \"If you had a programme of five people and two stayed on, that's still a win for us because we have got young people into our business.\"</p>",
