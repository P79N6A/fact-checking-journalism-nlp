      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has launched its own brand of milk, which it claims will make it \u201crain money\u201d for the world\u2019s biggest drinks company. The new Fairlife milk will cost more than twice as much as regular milk, but the company reckons consumers will be prepared to shell out more as it will contain 50% more protein and half the sugar of normal milk. The milk went on sale on Tuesday in selected US supermarkets, priced at $4.59 for a 52-ounce bottle compared to the national average of $2.18 for a half-gallon (64 ounces) of milk. The milk also comes in chocolate flavour. Steve Jones, a former Coke executive who is now chief executive of the company\u2019s Fairlife joint venture with dairy farmers, said all major US retailers \u2013 including Walmart, Target, Kroger and Safeway \u2013 would sell the milk. It will be distributed by Coke\u2019s Minute Maid team. Sandy Douglas, Coke\u2019s global chief customer officer, let slip last year that the company was planning a massive investment in the new \u201cpremiumized\u201d milk which he hoped would prove so profitable it would \u201crain money\u201d for the firm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand, so it won\u2019t rain money in the early couple of years. But like Simply [Coke\u2019s premium fruit juice line], when you do it well, it rains money later,\u201d he told an investment conference. Jones said Coke\u2019s new milk, which has already been branded \u201cMilka-Cola\u201d on Twitter, would help reverse the decline in milk consumption by offering a superior product that he claims would taste nicer. He claimed the milk would be \u201cbetter for cows, better for people and better for the planet\u201d. Jones dismissed claims that the new drink amounted to the \u201cFrankensteining of milk\u201d. \u201c[This is about] leaving all the calcium and protein intact, just giving us a [end result of] higher level of protein and less sugars,\u201d he said on a conference call with journalists, during which the company declined to answer any questions from the Guardian. Comedian Stephen Colbert has already joked about the product, which he described as \u201cextra expensive science milk\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like they got Frankenstein to lactate,\u201d he added. Early adverts for the milk in the test markets of Minneapolis and Denver featured women wearing nothing but milk splashes in the shape of dresses with taglines including \u201cBetter Milk Looks Good On You.\u201d Jones defended the adverts, which have been criticised for being sexist, and described the media campaign as \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Coca-Cola will roll out a new nationwide marketing campaign around the end of March or early April. Jones said the company was planning to \u201ccrank up the awareness level very, very quickly\u201d. The company does not yet have plans to sell the milk in the UK or elsewhere in Europe.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Compare and contrast. Last week Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, opined that the \u201clong-term equilibrium\u201d for the oil price lay at about $90, which sounded semi-cheerful from the point of view of a producer. Van Beurden thought it was important not to \u201cover-react\u201d to current lower prices. On Tuesday Bob Dudley at BP warned of a \u201craging gale\u201d in the oil industry that could last for years. He wasn\u2019t talking long-term equilibriums, let alone suggesting where they might lie. Instead, he said the current situation \u201cfeels like 1986\u201d, when the oil price crashed by three-quarters, rather than the mere halving that has been witnessed since last summer. Over-reaction \u2013 or, at least, a big reaction \u2013 sounds like Dudley\u2019s starting position. BP is cutting capital spending by 20% to $20bn (\u00a313bn), a deeper reduction than Shell\u2019s 14%. If BP sounds more alarmed or pragmatic than its rival, there are probably three reasons why. First, BP is trying to do two things at once: react to lower oil prices and adapt to changes in its own business. After the Deepwater Horizon disaster it shed $40bn of assets, from Alaska to Egypt, in a hurry to raise funds. Its timing, it turns out, was excellent but BP seems to have been slower in shedding central overheads. It now needs to hurry up. Second, the eventual bill for Deepwater Horizon is still not clear. The maximum penalty under the US Clean Water Act has been set at $13.7bn but the company hopes the actual sum will be substantially less. But, given that BP was been consistently disappointed by the US legal process, it is wise to prepare for the worst. Third, one slug of BP\u2019s future continues to be tied up in Russia. Dudley says he is still keen to invest there, but that ambition will surely have to be revised if the politics become trickier. Again, the position argues for caution. The big question for BP and Shell, of course, is whether they can muddle through without cutting their dividends, which currently offer yields of close to 6%. Nobody doubts the determination and both companies have balance sheets capable of absorbing some pain. The best guess is that the dividend ought to survive a two-year gale, if that is defined as an oil price (which has actually been rising this week) sticking around current levels. But a three-year storm? That might be the limit of endurance for the dividends. Ocado starts to deliver About \u00a3450m has been spent building Ocado over the past 15 years so, viewed through that lens, the first appearance of a pre-tax profit, albeit only \u00a310.1m, is not much to shout about. If the above sounds churlish, it\u2019s not meant to. Ocado is in the happy position of being funded for its first decade by investors who were prepared to take a very long-term view of the online grocery revolution. Even after flotation in 2010, management came under little pressure to alter its mantra of \u201cinvestment comes first\u201d. The only real danger came in late 2012 when funding became tight. But Ocado secured a new \u00a3100m banking facility and \u00a336m from shareholders. The share price took off from a low of 50p in January 2013, quickly passed the float price of 180p, and touched 600p a year ago after signing a partnership deal with Morrisons. It was 435p on Tuesday, making the company worth \u00a32.5bn. The chief executive, Tim Steiner, is entitled to crow. If you sold all your shares in Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons in 2010 and stuck the proceeds into Ocado at float, you would have done very nicely. Eat your heart out Sir Terry Leahy, ex-Tesco boss and chief Ocado sceptic of old. For all that, shares still seem priced for perfection. Operating cash flow last year was only \u00a374.6m, which hardly justifies a \u00a32.5bn valuation for a business increasing revenues at 15%. The hope, of course, is that Ocado will be able to sell its model and expertise to retailers around the globe. Steiner says the first such deal could be struck this year. One assumes he is confident, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be raising expectations now. But the deal closer to home \u2013 with Waitrose \u2013 remains far more important. The next potential break-point is March 2017 and relations in the past have been frosty. Viewed from outside, it seems commercially rational for both sides to renew. But, you never know how negotiations will turn out. The Ocado brand, conceivably, is now strong enough for the group to pursue the DIY option of seeking its own deals with suppliers. But the hassle factor would be immense. That lingering risk is the reason why Ocado seems fundamentally overvalued. It\u2019s a pioneer, with a stunning record of defying the doomsters. But a 15-year wait for pre-tax profits may be followed by a 15-year wait for dividends. Despite the commendable focus on long-term horizons, that still matters. Greek rationalism Down 10% one day, up 10% the next. The Greek stock market, unfortunately, is behaving rationally. Tuesday\u2019s outbreak of optimism was prompted by Syriza\u2019s proposal that Greece\u2019s debt payments be linked to GDP growth. It\u2019s a sensible idea and, if it is also evidence of the new Greek government\u2019s willingness to compromise, very welcome. Do not be surprised, however, if the market\u2019s next reaction is pessimism: eurozone officials sounded cool on the proposal. The only safe bet is that the talks will go down to the wire. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, does not negotiate in a rush \u2013 or before she has a decent view of how German voters will react to any proposal.",

Lawyers acting for the part-time staff sent letters to Sports Direct\u2019s legal team on Friday claiming a total of just over \u00a31m in compensation for missed bonuses for a first batch of 30 workers. The individual claims average about \u00a336,000 each but the highest is worth more than \u00a3100,000. All of the first 30 seeking compensation, with help from the legal firm Leigh Day, have a minimum of five and a half years in continuous employment with Sports Direct, including the period covered by the bonus. Some of the staff involved, whose claims were gathered in partnership with workers rights group Pay Justice, have worked for the company for considerably longer, despite being employed on insecure contracts. Letters relating to the remaining 268 workers will be gradually filed over the next six months or so. It is not clear if the average claim for all those workers will be \u00a336,000 but, if it is, the total cost to Sports Direct could amount to nearly \u00a310m. Some of the workers making claims for the missed bonuses still work for Sports Direct, and Leigh Day has called on the company to confirm they will not be penalised or dismissed for making the claims. The law firm says that to do so would be unlawful under regulations that protect part-time workers. On receiving the claim letters, Sports Direct is required to provide a response. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, the claims will go to court, which will then have to determine whether the long-serving, zero-hours staff had a contractual right to the bonus awards and should therefore be compensated. Sports Direct, which is controlled by the billionaire Newcastle United football club owner Mike Ashley, has been widely criticised for employing nearly 90% of its staff on zero-hours contracts. In October last year, the retailer was forced to make clear the limitations of such contracts to staff and to inform them that they were entitled to sick pay and holiday pay after legal action by former worker Zahera Gabriel-Abraham. Gabriel-Abraham left the retailer\u2019s Croydon branch in 2013 after suffering panic attacks, which she blamed on a lack of financial security as her contract offered no guaranteed work or income. Her legal action was backed by the financial support of more than 5,000 members of the campaign group 38 Degrees. Sports Direct said the settlement was made without admission of any liability whatsoever. Lawyers said the public nature of the company\u2019s promise to communicate more clearly about zero-hours contracts with staff meant it could be held to account. The latest legal action highlights how zero-hours workers, many of whom have worked for the company for long periods of time, have been excluded from Sports Direct\u2019s generous staff bonus scheme. The company has credited the payouts for helping it achieve strong sales growth and halving the rate at which workers leave the company. A second bonus scheme is due to pay out to about 3,000 employees this summer and again in 2017. In July last year, shareholders passed a third bonus plan that would hand 25m free shares in the company to about the same number of \u201cpermanent\u201d staff, including Ashley, if earnings double by 2019. Ashley pulled out of the scheme a few days later. The business secretary, Vince Cable, has warned \u201cunscrupulous employers\u201d that he plans to ban clauses in zero-hours contracts that prevent workers accepting shifts with more than one employer. Cable launched a review in October that he said would ensure employers knew their responsibilities and individuals their rights. Sports Direct declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Belgium has come under investigation by the European commission over tax breaks for multinational companies as Brussels widens its crackdown on corporate tax avoidance. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the commission believed Belgium\u2019s tax system violated European Union rules on illegal state aid by giving international companies an unfair advantage over Belgian competitors. Belgium allows companies to reduce their tax bills by claiming deductions for \u201cexcess profits\u201d that result from being part of a multinational group. These include economies of scale that flow from being an international business. But the commission said the deductions could significantly overstate the actual benefits, usually amounting to more than 50% of profits covered by the tax ruling, and in some cases 90%. Vestager said: \u201cThe Belgian \u2018excess profit\u2019 tax system appears to grant substantial tax reductions only to certain multinational companies that would not be available to standalone companies. \u201cIf our concerns are confirmed, this generalised scheme would be a serious distortion of competition, unduly benefiting a selected number of multinationals.\u201d Like other countries, including Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK, Belgium has tried to use its corporate tax system to attract large foreign companies. Belgium has high labour costs but the \u201cexcess profit\u201d provision lets multinational businesses cut their corporate tax bills to well below the standard 34% rate. Vestager rejected Belgium\u2019s argument that the arrangement avoided \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of a company in two or more countries, saying that no other country had made a claim to tax the same profits. The Brussels crackdown comes after the Guardian and other news organisations published details of leaked tax rulings in Luxembourg showing how some of the biggest multinationals and household names had used complex financial webs to legally cut their liabilities. After the Luxleaks revelation the commission in December asked all 28 member countries for details of tax deals made with companies between 2010 and 2013. To qualify for the Belgian tax break, a company needs to secure a ruling from the country\u2019s tax authorities. The scheme appears only to benefit multinational companies and the rulings are often granted to companies that have moved large parts of their activities to Belgium, the commission said. Vestager declined to name companies that benefited but said they were based in the US and elsewhere. The commission\u2019s inquiry seeks to stop EU countries using unfair tax breaks to lure companies trying aggressively to reduce their tax bills. The commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Amazon and Italian carmaker Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands. Tax avoidance is not illegal but revelations about low tax bills for multinational corporations such as Apple and Amazon have prompted protests about the power of \u201cstateless capital\u201d to avoid paying a fair contribution towards the societies in which corporations do business. Europe and the US have increased efforts to stop countries competing unfairly to attract companies and to reduce corporations\u2019 ability to move their business to the cheapest jurisdiction. The commission started its investigation into some states in June 2013 but expanded it to include all member countries at the end of last year. Under pressure from the commission, Ireland was forced in October to close a tax loophole, the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d that had attracted companies such as Apple and Facebook to base their European headquarters in the country. President Obama set out plans on Monday to force US multinationals to pay tax on more than $2tn (\u00a31.3tn) of profits held in countries with lower corporate taxes. The White House has also clamped down on so-called inversion acquisitions of foreign companies by US companies that then move their tax bases to the takeover target\u2019s country to make savings. Vestager, Denmark\u2019s former deputy prime minister and economic minister, became competition commissioner in November and was soon in the spotlight when the Luxleaks documents revealed tax deals in Luxembourg when her boss, commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister. The revelations led to calls for Juncker to be investigated over allegations that he encouraged corporate tax avoidance. Juncker has rejected the allegations.",

      "bodyText": "It has taken 15 years to get there - but the online grocery firm Ocado has finally delivered a profit. The company, founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in 2000, is cashing in on changing shopping habits as more customers choose to drop the weekly supermarket shop in favour of buying online. The business was built on selling Waitrose groceries, but it now offers a range of own-brand goods and last year did a deal with Morrisons to offer an online grocery service to the supermarket chain\u2019s shoppers. Tim Steiner, one of the founders and the company\u2019s chief executive, said that while traditional grocers such as Tesco and Morrisons were battling with declining sales, price wars and cautious consumers, Ocado was growing \u201cahead of the online grocery market and significantly ahead of the market overall\u201d. Ocado was in the black to the tune of just over \u00a37m \u2013 from revenues of nearly \u00a31bn\u2013 in the year to the end of November. Every previous year it has been in the red, recording a \u00a312.5m loss in 2013. The lack of profits has not stopped the founders becoming multimillionaires. Two of the original three \u2013 Jason Gissing and Jonathan Faiman \u2013 have retired from the business. Gissing cashed in shares worth \u00a315m last year to spend more time working on environmental projects, while Faiman now lives in Monaco. The number of Ocado shoppers increased by 68,000 over the year to 453,000 and they are big spenders: the average amount spent by customers per online shop was \u00a3112.25. Steiner said he expected the pace of growth to continue at a similar rate because online shopping would become more efficient, enabling Ocado to cut prices. \u201cOur early association with Waitrose means we are seen to be an expensive retailer, but we offer outstanding value for people in the UK who can shop like they\u2019re rich but don\u2019t need to be,\u201d he said. Steiner said Ocado had been able to book a profit because it was pushing more goods through its highly-mechanised distribution centres, making them more efficient. The extra goods are partly the result of the deal with Morrisons. The business\u2019s move into the black comes during a difficult time for Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets, which are jostling for market share amid the switch to online shopping and the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Steiner said profits would have been \u00a310m higher if the firm had not been forced to cut prices to stay competitive, which had hit profit margins but Ocado had been relatively unscathed by falling food prices, which was \u201cdecimating the profitabilty\u201d of some supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s blamed an intense price war for its first fall in Christmas sales in a decade and announced it was pulling out of building 40 new supermarkets. Tesco last week revealed the identities of 43 unprofitable stores it will close in an attempt to turn around the embattled company. It has also abandoned 49 new store developments. Steiner said he did not know if Ocado would remain profitable, because this year\u2019s profit had been a happy accident rather than part of the plan. \u201cWe\u2019re not sitting here popping open the champagne,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may or may not [book a profit this year]. It\u2019s not our primary focus to make short-term profit. We are focused on long-term shareholder value.\u201d Ocado is increasing its investment spending by more than a third to \u00a3150m to open new distribution centres and increase the size of its fleet of vans. It also plans to launch a specialist online beauty store in partnership with women\u2019s magazine Marie Claire. The firm has delivered groceries for Waitrose since it was founded in 2000, and launched a separate partnership with Morrisons in January last year, enabling the supermarket chain to offer an online service for the first time. Steiner would not be drawn on speculation that Waitrose could end its long-standing relationship with Ocado in 2017, when there is a break clause in the contract. He said that while Ocado saw no reason to terminate the deal, \u201cthere is no point me speculating about what other people want to do\u201d.",

Every previous year it has been in the red, recording a \u00a312.5m loss in 2013.</p> <p>The lack of profits has not stopped the founders becoming multimillionaires. Two of the original three \u2013 Jason Gissing and Jonathan Faiman \u2013 have retired from the business. Gissing cashed in shares worth \u00a315m last year to spend more time working on environmental projects, while Faiman now lives in Monaco.</p> <p>The number of Ocado shoppers increased by 68,000 over the year to 453,000 and they are big spenders: the average amount spent by customers per online shop was \u00a3112.25.</p> <p>Steiner said he expected the pace of growth to continue at a similar rate because online shopping would become more efficient, enabling Ocado to cut prices.</p> <p>\u201cOur early association with Waitrose means we are seen to be an expensive retailer, but we offer outstanding value for people in the UK who can shop like they\u2019re rich but don\u2019t need to be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Steiner said Ocado had been able to book a profit because it was pushing more goods through its highly-mechanised distribution centres, making them more efficient. The extra goods are partly the result of the deal with Morrisons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/11/ocado-sales-rise-beats-forecast\">Ocado dismisses fears over Waitrose supply deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The business\u2019s move into the black comes during a difficult time for Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets, which are jostling for market share amid the switch to online shopping and the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Steiner said profits would have been \u00a310m higher if the firm had not been forced to cut prices to stay competitive, which had hit profit margins but Ocado had been relatively unscathed by falling food prices, which was \u201cdecimating the profitabilty\u201d of some supermarkets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/sainsburys-150m-price-cuts-slumps-first-half-loss-profits\">Sainsbury\u2019s blamed an intense price war</a> for its first fall in Christmas sales in a decade and announced it was pulling out of building 40 new supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to pay more than \u00a32m to its former chief executive and finance director after being told it had no legal grounds to continue withholding the payouts. The supermarket chain announced in October it was blocking payments of \u00a31.2m to Philip Clarke and \u00a3970,800 to Laurie McIlwee while it investigated last year\u2019s \u00a3263m accounting scandal, which came to light after the pair left last year. Tesco said it would pay the two men because \u201cdefending costly claims for the payments would not be in the company\u2019s best interests\u201d. The company said it might attempt to claw back the cash in the future. \u201cThe company is contractually committed to make the relevant payment to each former director unless it can legally establish a case of gross misconduct against him. The company has taken legal advice and has concluded that it does not have the basis for continuing to withhold the payments,\u201d it said. The payout is the latest blow for the supermarket which has suffered a string of profits warnings in the past few years as sales in the UK and overseas have fallen. Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, is cutting hundreds of jobs, closing 43 stores, pulling out of building 49 new outlets and abandoning Tesco\u2019s emblematic head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire as he attempts to shave \u00a3250m off annual running costs and recover investor confidence in the wake of the accounting scandal. Mcllwee resigned as chief finance officer in April last year while Clarke was ousted in July. After succeeding Clarke, Lewis stunned the City in September when he revealed that profits had been artificially inflated by \u00a3250m, a figure later increased to \u00a3263m. Nine executives were suspended; two have returned to work and four have left while there has been no update on the other three. McIlwee continued to be employed by Tesco until October but was told to stay away from the office during a \u201ctransition period\u201d when financial oversight of the business was handled by a \u201cgroup of senior finance personnel\u201d, according to Tesco. Clarke received his final pay cheque only last month and is still entitled to exercise nearly 900,000 free bonus share options which have a value of about \u00a32m at the current share price. He holds many more share options but the vesting price of all of those is above Tesco\u2019s share price. Clarke\u2019s departure after 40 years was regarded as particularly bruising, as he was preparing to attend a party to celebrate his tenure. The Serious Fraud Office is continuing to investigate the way that the accounts were stated. Tesco said: \u201cIf new information were to come to light which would change this assessment, the company will pursue recovery of the payments and damages and has fully reserved all its legal rights in this respect.\u201d The problems came to light after Lewis was brought in to maintain Tesco\u2019s dominance, which faced an increasing challenge from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers such as Waitrose. (Tues)Lewis suffered another blow on Tuesday as it emerged that Tesco\u2019s head of technology, Mike McNamara, who headed the national rollout of Tesco.com, is leaving after 15 years at the company to join US retailer Target. Lewis said: \u201cMike has been a tremendous asset to our business and we are sad to see him go.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At first sight, you would think something terrible had happened to the town centre of Kirkby. And in a way, it has. To all intents and purposes, this is a new town, built in the 1950s and 60s to house human \u201coverspill\u201d from Liverpool, 10 miles to the south-west. Its main feature is the modernist shopping centre that runs down Cherryfield Drive, Kirkby\u2019s main drag \u2013 though these days, any visitor\u2019s attention is more likely to be drawn to what sits on the other side of the road: two great mountains of rubble, which then give way to a strip of boarded-up buildings and an expanse of empty houses, some of which are already being demolished. Look closely, and you can see curtains still draped in the windows, different shades of wallpaper, and, among the nearby debris, traces of the lives now being lived somewhere else. Nestling next to bricks and severed pipes are satellite dishes, garden furniture and a child\u2019s car window shade featuring the incongruous image of Disney\u2019s Winnie the Pooh. All of this sits behind a tangle of steel fences, and hoardings that feature the Tesco logo, along with the insignia of Spenhill \u2013 one of the supermarket giant\u2019s subsidiaries, which specialises in construction \u2013 and a slogan that now has a grimly ironic ring: \u201cMaking life better.\u201d A huge Tesco supermarket \u2013 and retail park \u2013 was meant to be coming to Kirkby. But last month, the company announced that the town was one of 49 places that wouldn\u2019t be getting one after all. Local people are angry, baffled and, in some cases, still optimistic that the development plan might be rescued. This story is complicated. Tesco might have abandoned its new supermarket, but it still owns the lion\u2019s share of Kirkby\u2019s town centre, which it bought for \u00a365m and was going to redevelop as part of its plans. The day I arrive, as if to prove that it still wants to do right by the place, paving stones are being ripped up as part of what the borough council calls Tesco\u2019s \u201congoing work to transform public spaces\u201d. More sceptical voices say they have already had a bellyful of Tesco\u2019s idea of transformation, and the results are clear to see: abandoned playing fields, a demolished former hotel and nursing home, and the closed-down former home of the local Council for Voluntary Service. The biggest source of fury, though, is the 72 homes whose occupants were moved to brand new houses elsewhere in the town in preparation for Tesco\u2019s arrival \u2013 all structurally sound, but still destined for demolition. My guides are three of the founders of a pressure group-cum-political party called 1st 4 Kirkby, founded to try to break through what they see as deadened local politics (there are 63 councillors in the borough of Knowsley, all of them Labour), and push for a very different regeneration plan. \u201cKirkby is not a particularly prosperous town,\u201d says Matt Donnelly, 27. \u201cIt needed regeneration 20 years ago. The economy of the borough is on its backside. Just recently, we had a communication from the leader of the council, asking us all to shop locally to boost the local economy.\u201d He looks out the window. \u201cBut who\u2019s going to come to the town centre now?\u201d Tesco\u2019s descent into crisis and uncertainty has been dramatic. In 2012, it announced its first fall in profits in 20 years (to \u00a32.5bn), boasted of new investment in a \u00a31bn \u201cmakeover\u201d, and served notice that it was calming its aggressive plans for expansion. The next year, pre-tax profits dropped by a cool 51%. By early 2014, Tesco was issuing profit warnings, as their market share tumbled to its lowest in 10 years, and in September, it was revealed the company had overstated its profits by \u00a3250m. In early 2015 news broke of those 49 cancelled projects \u2013 in places ranging from Aviemore in Scotland to Dartford in Kent \u2013 and, in turn, 43 existing supermarkets set to close. This fit of streamlining caused Tesco\u2019s share price to bounce up, but the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, said he was announcing the cancellations \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. He went on: \u201cMy absolute imperative has to be to protect the future of our business for the 300,000 colleagues we employ in communities all over the UK. I know that this news will be a real disappointment to many and we\u2019re extremely grateful for the support we\u2019ve received for each of the 49 projects. I am very aware of the importance of our sites to their local areas and I am determined that we will work closely with local councils to find the right solution for each community.\u201d Underneath the statistics, there are two intertwined stories. One is about the fate of places that had either pinned all their hopes on Tesco\u2019s arrival, or opposed its plans from the start. The other is the demise of what has effectively become Britain\u2019s only viable model of regeneration, and the fact that no one seems to have a clue what might replace it. By the mid-1990s, this regeneration strategy was well established: base your plans on an \u201canchor store\u201d and attract one of the big four supermarkets. If you were lucky, whichever store had designs on your neighbourhood might extend its proposals to an entire retail development, and perhaps assent to a so-called Section 106 agreement (a reference to part of the 1990 Planning Act), and build not just a big store and a handful of satellite shops, but something for the local community: a new library, say, or a public square. If you were less fortunate, you would just get a bog-standard supermarket. Throughout the 1990s and all the way up to the crash of 2008 and beyond, this was how whole swaths of Britain were rebuilt, and Tesco led the charge, to the point that it sometimes seemed to be a wing of government, and some people began to fear the dystopia crystallised in the title of Andrew Simms\u2019s best-selling book Tescopoly. Now, though, Tesco is in retreat, and its sudden withdrawal from scores of places has left behind resentment, anger and what feels like a strange state of shock. On a freezing Tuesday afternoon in Bridgwater, the Somerset town that sits next to the M5, 35 miles south-west of Bristol, I meet some of the people who have spent six years opposing the now-abandoned plans for their town centre. The first thing I see is a vast expanse of grey gravel, extending into the distance: what would have been a cluster of shops surrounding a new Tesco, on a site between the town centre and the old docks, and eating into a much-used park called the Brewery Field. This used to be the site of a big leisure centre, the Sedgemoor Splash, built in 1991 and based around a huge swimming pool with slides and wave machines, which, say some locals, attracted visitors from as far away as South Wales. But in 2009, Sedgemoor district council announced it was to close, claiming it was losing money and in need of repairs. The day before it finally shut its doors on 31 August 2009, it was occupied by protesters, incensed by the news that once the site had been cleared, it was to be the home of a new Tesco Extra. The occupiers claimed the pool had simply been shut to make way for a supermarket, and that Tesco was in the frame long before it was closed; Sedgemoor council says the pool\u2019s closure and negotiations with Tesco \u201cwere two separate processes which overlapped at some stages\u201d. Whatever, local people opposed to the development founded a campaign group called Bridgwater Forward, and the row simmered for the next four years. A replacement pool was promised, but it took more than three years to open, on the site of a school a mile and a half out of town, well away from most local bus routes. A facility for people with learning difficulties on Tesco\u2019s intended site \u2013 owned by Somerset county council, which, for some reason, donated \u00a320,000 to Tesco\u2019s planning fees \u2013 also had to find a new home. Given that Bridgwater already has a Sainsbury\u2019s, an Asda and a Morrisons \u2013 as well as eight other supermarkets of various sizes \u2013 there was widespread bafflement about why the town needed another. Party politics were also streaked through the story: though Sedgemoor council is Conservative-run, Bridgwater has a long tradition of Labour-voting, and local politicians felt the Tesco plan was yet another example of folly and stupidity being imposed from outside. The borough council finally approved Tesco\u2019s plans in February 2013. Then, at the end of last year, news leaked out that Tesco was not coming after all. For Labour councillors Brian Smedley and Ian Tucker, and Glen Burrows, a local woman who is one of the founders of Bridgwater Forward, there is a mixture of relief and seething frustration at how this story played out. \u201cI\u2019m glad; I\u2019m really glad,\u201d says Burrows. \u201cBut it was market forces that stopped Tesco, not the fact that we had a massive campaign, and we had all the arguments. The council should have listened to us, and they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the biggest lesson: the fact that we\u2019ve got a problem with democracy.\u201d The council claims the pool was demolished as \u201ca purely financial decision\u201d, because it no longer had the money to support it, but she is having none of that. \u201cIt got knocked down, because they wanted to flog the land to Tesco,\u201d she says. \u201cWe lost something fabulous. It was used; it was popular. We lost all of that: an asset to the town, available to disabled people and elderly people \u2013 and for nothing.\u201d Quite what will now replace it is now unclear: with their customarily elegant use of English, Sedgemoor council will only say that \u201cfurther consultation will be had with the public and key stakeholders, with such consultation having due regard to the need to deliver any new project at no cost, apart from feasibility funds\u201d. If the timescale of the Bridgwater story seems achingly long, it has nothing on the epic tale of uncertainty seen in Wolverhampton, where Tesco\u2019s plans for a vast supermarket have also come to nothing. It was meant to be built on the site of the town\u2019s old Royal Hospital, a Grade II listed building. Indeed, the morning I arrive, behind imposing wooden walls done out in Tesco\u2019s trademark red and blue, construction workers in hi-vis jackets and hard hats are busy doing what Tesco calls \u201crestorative works\u201d, expected to be completed by the spring \u2013 but the rattles and bangs that echo around the site offer no hope of any real conclusion to this story. Tesco bought the hospital site in 2000, and promised a huge regeneration scheme that would also include other shops, offices and \u201ccommunity facilities\u201d. But they soon locked horns with Sainsbury\u2019s over another site in the city, and their plans fell into inertia. As far back as 2007, rumours begin to circulate that they would not be building the scheme after all \u2013 though at the start of 2014, the local Labour MP Pat McFadden received assurances everything would go ahead. McFadden has recently accused Tesco of \u201ca betrayal of the people of Wolverhampton\u201d. The Royal Hospital \u2013 or what remains of it \u2013 is the main landmark in an area known as All Saints, Wolverhampton\u2019s red-light district, named after the church that looks out on to the hospital site. For the last eight years, its vicar has been Sarah Schofield, a thoughtful and passionate emigree from Manchester, who was hurled into the Tesco story as soon as she took her current job. She talks about what Tesco has \u2013 or, rather, hasn\u2019t \u2013 done in terms of poor ethics, and \u201ctotal neglect\u201d. \u201cThe children who were born the year Tesco took on the site are now starting their GCSEs,\u201d she says. \u201cThat, to me, is a frightening fact.\u201d Schofield went along with the idea that, on balance, Tesco\u2019s arrival would be a good thing: \u201cDecent jobs \u2026 and cheap, fresh vegetables.\u201d But around four years ago, she says, she began to lose faith. \u201cTesco sacked their PR company then,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018If you\u2019ve not got a PR operation, you\u2019re obviously not planning to open any time soon.\u2019 But their line was always, \u2018It\u2019s about to happen.\u2019 There\u2019s a line in the Anglican liturgy: \u2018The hope of glory to come.\u2019 It was like that.\u201d As time went on, she says, the mood of the All Saints neighbourhood came to be defined by the empty expanse of land at its heart. \u201cAfter a while, people lose any sense of confidence in their own power,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t get people to take an interest in how to effect change, because they\u2019ve seen a case study in how not to effect change. Involvement in local politics is fairly poor, you don\u2019t get residents groups \u2026\u201d Tesco\u2019s current line on Wolverhampton is that, despite its withdrawal, \u201call parties are committed to bringing forward the development of the site as soon as possible, and engaging with the local community throughout this process\u201d, and \u201cat the first available opportunity\u201d the company will \u201cupdate the local community on progress and the potential viable uses for the site\u201d. Schofield translates this crisply. \u201cI think it\u2019ll sit as it is, for another few years,\u201d she says. Back in Kirkby, campaigners were also broadly sympathetic to the principle of a new supermarket for the town. Besides a cramped and rather shabby branch of the Co-op, the nearest is five miles away down the M57. \u201cWhen we first met Tesco, I said that they would probably have the very unusual circumstances of being welcomed into this town by all the residents, because we haven\u2019t had a decent supermarket here since the early 1980s,\u201d says 1st 4 Kirkby co-founder Dave Kelly. He and his fellow campaigners, though, were perplexed about why Tesco wouldn\u2019t entertain the idea of building something in the existing town centre \u2013 which, they pointed out, already contained a huge vacant supermarket, left behind by Asda in 1984. Kirkby\u2019s Tesco story goes back to 2006, when Everton Football Club announced it wanted to leave its age-old home at Goodison Park in north Liverpool and relocate to a new site in Kirkby, which would also include a Tesco Extra and retail park. The plan was thrown out by the-then Labour government. In 2013, Tesco was still promising to come. \u201cHoardings went up,\u201d says Donnelly. \u201cWe were told Tesco were definitely coming. Labour councillors were putting out leaflets with a timeline: they gave total assurances that they were on their way. Even in November last year, they were still saying they were coming.\u201d As it turned out, though, they were not. The Kirkby campaigners think the council\u2019s biggest mistake was the signing of an exclusivity agreement with Tesco that ruled out negotiations with other potential developers. In response, Dave Lonergan, the borough councillor in charge of \u201cregeneration, economy and skills\u201d, says that if they hadn\u2019t done that deal, \u201cTesco would have walked away\u201d. Local sceptics reckon the idea of any new developer being interested in acres of scrubland and rubble is a forlorn hope; Lonergan says the council has recently been \u201cin discussions with other retailers and developers who have expressed an interest in stepping into replace Tesco\u201d. And though plenty of people in Kirkby think the demolition of houses to clear the way for something that may never arrive is close to madness, Lonergan insists that \u201cthe site where the disused and vacant homes stand \u2026 is still needed for future development\u201d. In the town centre, I pop into a barber\u2019s called Billy Wizz, which has been here for seven years, and now pays its rent to Tesco. Local people, the staff tell me, are annoyed by the latest turn of events, and an array of empty shops testifies to nearly a decade of uncertainty: in effect, a plan for regeneration achieving its exact opposite. Given that Tesco isn\u2019t coming, how do people here feel about all those empty houses? The answer is unexpected. \u201cIf someone else is going to come along,\u201d says 43-year-old Carol Gorman, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to clear the space. And now that has happened. So it\u2019s more appealing.\u201d Never mind the rise of the discounters, the fall of one of the big four supermarkets, and the fact that an entire model of regeneration might have bitten the dust: she and her colleagues, she says, have heard rumours that another chain might be on its way. Round here, at least, hope apparently springs eternal. So who exactly is meant to coming? \u201cAsda,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard, anyway.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2015 to correct a reference to the cancellation of a Tesco store planned for Dartmouth, Kent.

To all intents and purposes, this is a new town, built in the 1950s and 60s to house human \u201coverspill\u201d from Liverpool, 10 miles to the south-west. Its main feature is the modernist shopping centre that runs down Cherryfield Drive, Kirkby\u2019s main drag \u2013 though these days, any visitor\u2019s attention is more likely to be drawn to what sits on the other side of the road: two great mountains of rubble, which then give way to a strip of boarded-up buildings and an expanse of empty houses, some of which are already being demolished.</p> <p>Look closely, and you can see curtains still draped in the windows, different shades of wallpaper, and, among the nearby debris, traces of the lives now being lived somewhere else. Nestling next to bricks and severed pipes are satellite dishes, garden furniture and a child\u2019s car window shade featuring the incongruous image of Disney\u2019s Winnie the Pooh. All of this sits behind a tangle of steel fences, and hoardings that feature the Tesco logo, along with the insignia of <a href=\"http://companycheck.co.uk/company/04827219\">Spenhill</a> \u2013 one of the supermarket giant\u2019s subsidiaries, which specialises in construction \u2013 and a slogan that now has a grimly ironic ring: \u201cMaking life better.\u201d</p> <p>A huge Tesco supermarket \u2013 and retail park \u2013 was meant to be coming to Kirkby.

Tesco might have abandoned its new supermarket, but it still owns the lion\u2019s share of Kirkby\u2019s town centre, which it bought for \u00a365m and was going to redevelop as part of its plans. The day I arrive, as if to prove that it still wants to do right by the place, paving stones are being ripped up as part of what the borough council calls Tesco\u2019s \u201congoing work to transform public spaces\u201d. More sceptical voices say they have already had a bellyful of Tesco\u2019s idea of transformation, and the results are clear to see: abandoned playing fields, a demolished former hotel and nursing home, and the closed-down former home of the local Council for Voluntary Service. The biggest source of fury, though, is the 72 homes whose occupants were moved to brand new houses elsewhere in the town in preparation for Tesco\u2019s arrival \u2013 all structurally sound, but still destined for demolition.</p> <p>My guides are three of the founders of a pressure group-cum-political party called <a href=\"http://1st4kirkby.org.uk\">1st 4 Kirkby</a>, founded to try to break through what they see as deadened local politics (there are 63 councillors in the borough of Knowsley, all of them Labour), and push for a very different regeneration plan. \u201cKirkby is not a particularly prosperous town,\u201d says Matt Donnelly, 27. \u201cIt needed regeneration 20 years ago. The economy of the borough is on its backside. Just recently, we had a communication from the leader of the council, asking us all to shop locally to boost the local economy.\u201d</p> <p>He looks out the window. \u201cBut who\u2019s going to come to the town centre now?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fda6f20e07a16dd70e1fc9f4e81889150a8349cd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/3/1422981491338/a9e233a6-470d-442b-a826-3c2c33527986-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco branch in London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last few years have seen Tesco plunge from one crisis to another.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tesco\u2019s descent into crisis and uncertainty has been dramatic.

The next year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/11/morrisons-profits-slump-2014-supermarkets-dividend\">pre-tax profits dropped by a cool 51%</a>. By early 2014, Tesco was issuing profit warnings, as their market share tumbled to its lowest in 10 years, and in September, it was revealed the company had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/22/tesco-loses-2bn-value-250m-profit-overstatement-investigation\">overstated its profits</a> by \u00a3250m.

One is about the fate of places that had either pinned all their hopes on Tesco\u2019s arrival, or opposed its plans from the start. The other is the demise of what has effectively become Britain\u2019s only viable model of regeneration, and the fact that no one seems to have a clue what might replace it.</p> <p>By the mid-1990s, this regeneration strategy was well established: base your plans on an \u201canchor store\u201d and attract one of the big four supermarkets. If you were lucky, whichever store had designs on your neighbourhood might extend its proposals to an entire retail development, and perhaps assent to a so-called <a href=\"http://www.pas.gov.uk/3-community-infrastructure-levy-cil/-/journal_content/56/332612/4090701/ARTICLE\">Section 106 agreement</a> (a reference to part of the 1990 Planning Act), and build not just a big store and a handful of satellite shops, but something for the local community: a new library, say, or a public square. If you were less fortunate, you would just get a bog-standard supermarket. Throughout the 1990s and all the way up to the crash of 2008 and beyond, this was how whole swaths of Britain were rebuilt, and Tesco led the charge, to the point that it sometimes seemed to be a wing of government, and some people began to fear the dystopia crystallised in the title of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/21/communities.supermarkets\">Andrew Simms</a>\u2019s best-selling book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tescopoly.html\">Tescopoly</a>. Now, though, Tesco is in retreat, and its sudden withdrawal from scores of places has left behind resentment, anger and what feels like a strange state of shock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"828d8c0670ed9c57d5938cc985acc6003a880846\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/3/1422981783528/af059470-06ef-40ff-9dca-b0cfdb90cde9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco Spenhill sign\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco and its Spenhill subsiduary aren\u2019t doing much to make life better in Kirkby, Bridgwater or Wolverhampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a freezing Tuesday afternoon in Bridgwater, the Somerset town that sits next to the M5, 35 miles south-west of Bristol, I meet some of the people who have spent six years opposing the now-abandoned plans for their town centre. The first thing I see is a vast expanse of grey gravel, extending into the distance: what would have been a cluster of shops surrounding a new Tesco, on a site between the town centre and the old docks, and eating into a much-used park called the Brewery Field.</p> <p>This used to be the site of a big leisure centre, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIJvcdabA1g\">Sedgemoor Splash</a>, built in 1991 and based around a huge swimming pool with slides and wave machines, which, say some locals, attracted visitors from as far away as South Wales. But in 2009, Sedgemoor district council announced it was to close, claiming it was losing money and in need of repairs. The day before it finally shut its doors on 31 August 2009, it was <a href=\"http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Protesters-stage-sit-save-pool-closure/story-11440897-detail/story.html\">occupied by protesters</a>, incensed by the news that once the site had been cleared, it was to be the home of a new Tesco Extra.</p> <p>The occupiers claimed the pool had simply been shut to make way for a supermarket, and that Tesco was in the frame long before it was closed; Sedgemoor council says the pool\u2019s closure and negotiations with Tesco \u201cwere two separate processes which overlapped at some stages\u201d. Whatever, local people opposed to the development founded a campaign group called <a href=\"http://bridgwaterforward.blogspot.co.uk\">Bridgwater Forward</a>, and the row simmered for the next four years.</p> <p>A replacement pool was promised, but it took more than three years to open, on the site of a school a mile and a half out of town, well away from most local bus routes. A facility for people with learning difficulties on Tesco\u2019s intended site \u2013 owned by Somerset county council, which, for some reason, donated \u00a320,000 to Tesco\u2019s planning fees \u2013 also had to find a new home. Given that Bridgwater already has a Sainsbury\u2019s, an Asda and a Morrisons \u2013 as well as eight other supermarkets of various sizes \u2013 there was widespread bafflement about why the town needed another. Party politics were also streaked through the story: though Sedgemoor council is Conservative-run, Bridgwater has a long tradition of Labour-voting, and local politicians felt the Tesco plan was yet another example of folly and stupidity being imposed from outside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/jan/28/tescos-store-closures-and-abandoned-developments-interactive\">Tesco's store closures and abandoned developments - interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The borough council finally approved Tesco\u2019s plans in February 2013. Then, at the end of last year, news leaked out that Tesco was not coming after all. For Labour councillors Brian Smedley and Ian Tucker, and Glen Burrows, a local woman who is one of the founders of Bridgwater Forward, there is a mixture of relief and seething frustration at how this story played out.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad; I\u2019m really glad,\u201d says Burrows. \u201cBut it was market forces that stopped Tesco, not the fact that we had a massive campaign, and we had all the arguments. The council should have listened to us, and they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the biggest lesson: the fact that we\u2019ve got a problem with democracy.\u201d</p> <p>The council claims the pool was demolished as \u201ca purely financial decision\u201d, because it no longer had the money to support it, but she is having none of that. \u201cIt got knocked down, because they wanted to flog the land to Tesco,\u201d she says. \u201cWe lost something fabulous. It was used; it was popular. We lost all of that: an asset to the town, available to disabled people and elderly people \u2013 and for nothing.\u201d Quite what will now replace it is now unclear: with their customarily elegant use of English, Sedgemoor council will only say that \u201cfurther consultation will be had with the public and key stakeholders, with such consultation having due regard to the need to deliver any new project at no cost, apart from feasibility funds\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fb1ede58fa934ff035f02ad71d9d6a26e091624\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/3/1422981983880/ea938048-a382-4c95-98dc-980d651e35dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco's Royal Hospital site in Wolverhampton\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco\u2019s Wolverhampton project, on the site of the former Royal Hospital, has been abandoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the timescale of the Bridgwater story seems achingly long, it has nothing on the epic tale of uncertainty seen in Wolverhampton, where Tesco\u2019s plans for a vast supermarket have also come to nothing.

Besides a cramped and rather shabby branch of the Co-op, the nearest is five miles away down the M57. \u201cWhen we first met Tesco, I said that they would probably have the very unusual circumstances of being welcomed into this town by all the residents, because we haven\u2019t had a decent supermarket here since the early 1980s,\u201d says 1st 4 Kirkby co-founder Dave Kelly. He and his fellow campaigners, though, were perplexed about why Tesco wouldn\u2019t entertain the idea of building something in the existing town centre \u2013 which, they pointed out, already contained a huge vacant supermarket, left behind by Asda in 1984.</p> <p>Kirkby\u2019s Tesco story goes back to 2006, when Everton Football Club announced it wanted to leave its age-old home at Goodison Park in north Liverpool and relocate to a new site in Kirkby, which would also include a Tesco Extra and retail park. The plan was thrown out by the-then Labour government. In 2013, Tesco was still promising to come. \u201cHoardings went up,\u201d says Donnelly. \u201cWe were told Tesco were definitely coming. Labour councillors were putting out leaflets with a timeline: they gave total assurances that they were on their way. Even in November last year, they were still saying they were coming.\u201d As it turned out, though, they were not.</p> <p>The Kirkby campaigners think the council\u2019s biggest mistake was the signing of an exclusivity agreement with Tesco that ruled out negotiations with other potential developers. In response, Dave Lonergan, the borough councillor in charge of \u201cregeneration, economy and skills\u201d, says that if they hadn\u2019t done that deal, \u201cTesco would have walked away\u201d. Local sceptics reckon the idea of any new developer being interested in acres of scrubland and rubble is a forlorn hope; Lonergan says the council has recently been \u201cin discussions with other retailers and developers who have expressed an interest in stepping into replace Tesco\u201d. And though plenty of people in Kirkby think the demolition of houses to clear the way for something that may never arrive is close to madness, Lonergan insists that \u201cthe site where the disused and vacant homes stand \u2026 is still needed for future development\u201d.</p> <p>In the town centre, I pop into a barber\u2019s called Billy Wizz, which has been here for seven years, and now pays its rent to Tesco. Local people, the staff tell me, are annoyed by the latest turn of events, and an array of empty shops testifies to nearly a decade of uncertainty: in effect, a plan for regeneration achieving its exact opposite. Given that Tesco isn\u2019t coming, how do people here feel about all those empty houses?</p> <p>The answer is unexpected. \u201cIf someone else is going to come along,\u201d says 43-year-old Carol Gorman, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to clear the space. And now that has happened. So it\u2019s more appealing.\u201d</p> <p>Never mind the rise of the discounters, the fall of one of the big four supermarkets, and the fact that an entire model of regeneration might have bitten the dust: she and her colleagues, she says, have heard rumours that another chain might be on its way. Round here, at least, hope apparently springs eternal. So who exactly is meant to coming?</p> <p>\u201cAsda,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2015 to correct a reference to the cancellation of a Tesco store planned for Dartmouth, Kent. This should have read Dartford, Kent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some late breaking news tonight... the European Central Bank is reportedly planning to play \u2018hardball\u2019 with Greece over its bailout. The FT\u2019s ever-well-informed Brussels correspondent, Peter Spiegel, reckons the ECB will refuse Athens\u2019 request for permission to borrow an extra \u20ac10bn to tide itself over while negotiations take place. He writes: The ECB is unwilling to approve the debt sale. It will not raise a \u20ac15bn ceiling on T-bill issuance by the requested \u20ac10bn, according two officials involved in the deliberations. \u201cThe Greek plan relies fully on the ECB,\u201d said another eurozone official briefed on the talks. \u201cThe ECB will play hardball.\u201d And that would leave Greece without any funding, when its bailout runs out on 28 February.... Doubtless we\u2019ll learn more tomorrow, when Yanis Varoufakis meets Mario Draghi..... GW European shares have moved sharply higher after Greece unveiled a debt swap plan to end the standoff with its European creditors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.32% at 6871.80 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.58% to 10,890.95 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.09% to 4677.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.57% to 21,011.55 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.62% better at 10,598.2 The Athens market (as noted earlier) was 11.27% better at 840.57 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 171 points or 0.99% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for When Varoufakis Met Draghi.

Helena Smith reports: Yanis Varoufakis was accused of not only leading Greece to certain bankruptcy by pursuing an economic policy \u201cthat will fail resoundingly\u201d but of committing the cardinal sin of behaving improperly while representing the country abroad. In unsparing language, the veteran politician, Theodore Pangalos, lashed out at the finance minister for his comportment, dress code and habit of keeping his hands in his pockets! \u201cWhat I think is most annoying about the Greek finance minister is his rudeness which is displayed in different ways. First of all that he doesn\u2019t tuck his shirt in. which is awful. Either you put it in or you don\u2019t\u2019 wear it. When you go to Downing Street you adjust your dress accordingly with that of your host. When everyone is wearing ties you don\u2019t go with your slippers. The second thing is, he constantly has his hand in his pocket \u2026 it is extremely rude to keep your hand in your pocket and the third thing is he \u2026 never introduces any [other Greek ministers] to his counterparts,\u201d he said. Pangalos, who held several ministerial posts, including foreign minister under former socialist Pasok administrations accused Varoufakis of paying more attention to his clothes than his job. \u201cIs it possible that in a country, in which the government itself claims that two thirds of the population face poverty, the man responsible for [handling] those problems focuses solely on what he wears.\u201d Greece\u2019s new Syriza-led government was heading towards disaster, Pangalos railed. \u201cThis policy is going to fail resoundingly and Syriza will enforce its Plan B to which it has never admitted or accepted and that is none other than bankruptcy. I see the state not being able to pay what it owes, including wages and pensions and because it will have to pay something the drachma will come back.\u201d More details of Greek finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 plans to meet German officials on Thursday, courtesy of Athens newspaper Kathimerini: [Varoufakis] said on Tuesday he would meet his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble in Berlin on Thursday for talks on his country\u2019s debt crisis. The minister announced the keenly-awaited encounter after meeting in Rome with his Italian counterpart. Varoufakis also confirmed he would meet ECB president Mario Draghi in Frankfurt on Wednesday. Germany is seen as the strongest opponent of any easing in the terms of the massive debts Greece has built up as a result of a series of international bailouts in the wake of the global financial crisis. Quite a contrast in styles in prospect: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has tweeted a picture of his meeting with his Italian counterpart Matteo Renzi: Meanwhile That\u2019s it! The Athens stock market has just closed, and a day of fevered buying has driven the main index up over 11%. That\u2019s despite the MNI newswire reporting that the European Central Bank will not accept the debt swap proposed by Yanis Yaroufakis (see earlier post for details). Clearly there\u2019s optimism that a deal can be hammered out..... Unfortunately, the Greek-Italian talks weren\u2019t broadcast (or at least I couldn\u2019t find them), so here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Tuesday that Greece needs to achieve strong economic growth through structural reforms in order to put its public debt on a sustainable path. \u201cAttention to growth is paramount to guarantee the sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt,\u201d Padoan said in a statement after meeting with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. Varoufakis is meeting his European counterparts this week to present the proposals of Greece\u2019s new government which wants to re-negotiate its public debt repayments and roll back austerity policies. Varoufakis told reporters his meeting with Padoan had been \u201cuseful and constructive\u201d and had addressed \u201call the main parameters for financial stability in the euro zone.\u201d He added that he would meet the European Central Bank on Wednesday and travel to Berlin on Thursday. [end] One could suggest that Italy could also use a spot of growth, having contracted or stagnated for most of the last three years... Italy\u2019s finance minister is pushing Greece on reforms and growth: ITALY\u2019S PADOAN SAYS GROWTH SHOULD BE PRIORITY TO GUARANTEE GREEK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY, CREATE JOBS ITALY\u2019S PADOAN SAYS IS CONFIDENT SOLUTIONS FOR GREECE CAN BE FOUND IN INTEREST OF WHOLE OF EU Newsflashes from Rome, following the talks between the Italian government and Greece\u2019s anti-austerity roadshow: GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS HAD CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH ITALY FINMIN ON EURO ZONE FINANCIAL STABILITY, WILL TRAVEL TO BERLIN THURSDAY ITALY\u2019S PADOAN SAYS AFTER VAROUFAKIS MEETING THAT GREECE NEEDS STRONG GROWTH THROUGH STRUCTURAL REFORMS There\u2019s a rumour sweeping the City that the European Central Bank will not accept Greece\u2019s bond swap proposal (for the ECB to exchange its existing Greek debt for new \u2018perpetual bonds\u2019). That\u2019s via the MNI newswire. Greek deal optimism, and the surprise interest rate cut by Australia overnight, are cheering traders in New York. Wall Street just opened, and the Dow Jones index has followed Europe\u2019s lead by rallying almost 1%. The euro is also rallying today, up almost 1% or over a cent to $1.144 against the US dollar. Higher still, and higher, goes the Greek stock market.... The BBC\u2019s Linda Yueh explains why Varoufakis\u2019s meeting in Frankfurt with Mario Draghi tomorrow is crucial: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is looking terribly smooth at the start of his talks in Italy -- no bright-blue shirt or thigh-length coat this time.... Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has predicted that the Greek negotiations will last for months. Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, she also declined to comment on the new debt swap proposal: \u201cIt is clear that the Greek government is still working on its position - that is more than understandable if you look at how few days this government has been in office. \u201cWe are waiting for proposals and then we will enter talks ... I don\u2019t want to comment individually on all the details that are being disseminated.\u201d The Athens rally is picking up fresh momentum.... Newsflash from Italy -- Greece\u2019s finance minister has announced that he will see the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, on Wednesday. And then German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Thursday. Their reaction to Greece\u2019s debt swap proposal will be crucial.... Reminder, Yanis Varoufakis should be meeting Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, shortly in Rome..... A quick recap: Greek bonds and stock have surged this morning on hopes of a breakthrough between Athens and its official creditors. The Athens stock market is up almost 8%, as investor confidence rallied. National Bank of Greece is up almost 23%. And Greek bond yields have tumbled, as default fears receded. The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has fallen by more than one percent, a big move, from 11.4% to 10.2%. The trigger for the rally came last night, after finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told City investors that he hopes to swap some existing debt for new bonds linked to Greek growth (as Germany received in 1953). He also suggests that the ECB\u2019s holdings could be changed for new \u2018perpetual bonds\u2019 - yielding a coupon, but never to be repaid. Full details here. Donald Kohn, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, has predicted that a deal will be agreed. But another BoE policymaker, Martin Taylor, warned that Greece\u2019s creditors need to realise they will not get all their money back. European markets are all up today, pushing towards their highest level in seven years. Analysts believe Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new government is showing a more conciliatory attitude; Hugo Dixon of Breaking Views reckons the risks of Grexit have receded to 20%. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Varoufakis is walking a tightrope. \u201dSwapping national debt for growth-linked bonds is indeed a way to ease austerity, but it falls short of the haircuts that are likely to be blocked by key creditors. As Greece\u2019s creditors chew the idea over, the clock is ticking on the nation\u2019s fiscal situation and the health of its banks.\u201d And there\u2019s still a risk that the European Central Bank could pull its support for the Greek banking sector if there isn\u2019t a deal by the end of February, when the current bailout expires. Three Greek banks have already sought emergency liquidity assistance from the ECB, it emerged today, showing tensions building in the system. Berich explains: The ECB has a tough, rather politicised choice to make if it continues to provide liquidity past this point Equally, the Greek government itself must find the funds to continue to function on a short term basis, and has asked for permission from the Troika to issue extra short term debt. Should the ECB or the Troika take a hard line on either of Greece\u2019s critical short term needs, a rapid collapse in the Greek banking sector or even the government\u2019s fiscal position remains a worrying possibility.\u201d Varoufakis has personally denied that the new government has ditched its plans; he pledges that his plan will ease Greece\u2019s debt burden. There\u2019s also excitement in Athens that the Troika could soon be abolished. Back in parliament, Bank of England policymaker Martin Taylor has warned that Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable and creditors are wrong to believe they can get all their money back. Martin Taylor, who sits on the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, told MPs that Germany needs to rethink its position. Reuters has the details: \u201cIt looks to me to be unsustainable,\u201d Taylor told Britain\u2019s parliament when asked about Greece\u2019s debt. \u201cIf the creditor nations really do believe they are going to get their money back, we are in an even worse situation than I think we are,\u201d Taylor told parliament\u2019s Treasury Select Committee. One of the \u201ctragedies of the European situation\u201d was that Germany was split between being pro-European at all times, and the need for monetary and financial rigour at all times, Taylor said. \u201cWhen these come into conflict, the easiest way to resolve it is to claim that monetary and financial rigour is pro-European,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis conflict needs to be laid bare ... and one just hopes that Germany will come to a coherent solution and I am sure they will,\u201d Taylor, a former senior banker, added. While we\u2019re collecting internet humour.... That Yanis Varoufakis/Steve McQueen meme is gathering speed: Hat-tip to General Boles and his military-class Photoshop skills. Elsewhere in the eurozone...Irish growth rates will be not as strong this year compared to 2014, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Moodys predict Ireland\u2019s economy will grow by 3.8% in 2015 which down from GDP growth rates for last year. In 2014 real GDP growth was estimated at around 5%. But the global ratings agency said the rate was \u201cstill a very solid performance\u201d for the Republic compared to other EU economies. Irish economic growth will continue to rise in 2016 - the year of the next general election in the Republic - by 3% despite underperforming banks and a still huge national debt. (via Henry McDonald) Yanis Varoufakis is expected to meet Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan around 2pm today, to push his debt swap plan. Another chance for Varoufakis to cement his growing reputation as Europe\u2019s coolest politician. As Helena Smith reported last weekend, he\u2019s made quite a splash: Yanis Varoufakis was forced to battle his way past high-school girls wielding mobile phones when he turned up for his first day at work. And that\u2019s not because the shaven-head economics professor likes to blog, or knows a thing or two about poetry, which he is prone to deliver with a rare panache. At 53, the Greek Australian takes his pecs seriously. Indeed, the real talk of the town, as it enters this most critical of times, is the pop star appeal of the man who will come face-to-face with creditors at the negotiating table. More here: Barricades down, ties off: welcome to Greece\u2019s style revolution There was also excitement in Athens after Varoufakis arrived at the prime minister\u2019s office on a giant 1300cc Yamaha motorbike. Very Steve McQueen-esque.... Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is also visiting Italy today, due to meet with Matteo Renzi around 5pm local time (4pm GMT). Donald Kohn, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, has forecast that a deal over Greece\u2019s debt will be hammered out. Kohn told MPs on parliament\u2019s Treasury committee this morning that the two sides are inching closer: \u201cMy expectation is that Greece and the euro zone members and the IMF will work together for an agreement,\u201d \u201cWe have heard some language in the last day or two that suggests a little bit of progress, a little bit of give.\u201d Hugo Dixon of Breaking Views argues that Greece\u2019s new government has made some important concessions over its debts, that limit the risk of exiting the eurozone. He laid it out in this small \u2018tweetstorm\u2019: The Greek stock market has surged by 7.5% today, as Athens investors give a thumbs-up to the debt swap plan devised by Yanis Varoufakis. It has now recovered most of its losses since the general election: Bank shares continue to lead the way: So, plenty of optimism around that the two sides will resolve the issue amicably, even though we\u2019ve not heard anything official from Germany or the European Central Bank about this plan. Reports on the wires that three Greek banks have accessed the emergency funding available from the European Central Bank. That\u2019s not a reason for panic. The ELA window is there to provide emergency liquidity assistance, to help banks who cannot access funds in the wholesale market. Overseas banks have been cutting their exposure to Greece in recent weeks, leaving its lenders at risk of a liquidity squeeze as some savers cut their deposits. There is much excitement in Athens today over reports that plans are afoot to dismantle the deeply unpopular \u201ctroika\u201d of auditors from the EU, ECB and IMF. Helena Smith reports: Senior officials are telling me it would be \u201can undoubted victory\u201d for a government otherwise facing a brick wall when it comes to demands for debt reduction and austerity cancellation. Following murmurings by the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker that Europe would be better off without the institution, the German business daily, Handelsblatt, reported this morning that the European Central Bank thinks it might not be a bad idea either. The paper quotes a German government source as saying \u201cthe ECB will use the chance to exit.\u201d There is growing speculation \u2013 mooted by Handelsblatt \u2013 that the Washington-based IMF is also considering following suit. Athens\u2019 new Syriza-led government has not wasted any time telling anyone who will listen that it will not be doing business with a mechanism the radical leftists have long argued is, first and foremost, undemocratically elected. One insider says: \u201cIt seems that they are coming round to the realization that the troika has to go.\u201d \u201cIt was very humiliating having these men fly in every three months [to monitor economic progress] like we were some colony.\u201d But Germany is still standing its ground with spokespeople for chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schauble both ruling out the abolition of the inspectorate. \u201cThe German government sees no reason to scrap this mechanism of evaluation \u2026 and we also see no indications that the European Union is distancing itself from this evaluation process,\u201d the chancellor\u2019s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz said. We first reported Alexis Tsipras\u2019 reaction to the news late last night. Update: The IMF currently has a permanent representative stationed in Athens. But the Greek government has stated it\u2019s willing to sacrifice the \u20ac7.2bn troika funding still outstanding (the tranche was held over amid disagreement over the country implementing further austerity) rather than subject itself to further inspection by the institution, Helena adds. The rally in Greek bonds has driven the yield on its 10-year debt down to 10.3%, from 11.4% last night. The BBC\u2019s Gavin Hewitt sums it up: Just in. Britain\u2019s construction sector grew faster than expected in January, as confidence rose and new orders picked up. Markit\u2019s monthly construction PMI rose to 59.1 in January, having hit a 17-month low of 57.6 in December (any reading over 50 shows growth) Fears that Britain\u2019s builders were suffering a slowdown should be allayed, says Markit. Firms reported that sub-contractors were particularly hard to find last month, pushing up their charges to a near record-high. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says construction made a \u2018perky\u2019 start to 2015, although hiring slowed down:\uf0a7 \u201cNew orders were up, but staffing levels have yet to catch-up showing at their lowest level of growth for 13 months, which may slow down activity as companies struggle to keep up with new demand. With supply chains under pressure, supply shortages, longer delivery times and a sharp fall in the performance of suppliers, there may still be challenges ahead. The FTSE 100 has now risen by 1.3%, gaining 93 points to 6875 points as Greek anxieties continue to ebb. Australia\u2019s overnight interest rate cut is also boosting sentiment, as it should help the resource sector. BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian mining, metals and petroleum company, has jumped 5%. Greece\u2019s proposal to link debt repayments to the future health of its economy has been seen before in Europe. After the second world war, when Germany succesfully negotiated a debt restructuring that set it on the path for recovery. Jeremy Cook, chief economist of currency exchange firm World First, says there\u2019s a clear comparison: Germany had to operate a current account surplus, i.e. exporting more than it imported, by around 3% for them to start paying off the loans. This encouraged other countries to purchase German exports and allowed them to rebuild a manufacturing industry that was crippled as part of the conflict. The benefits are clear to see now. Germany also had around 50% of its outstanding debt written off, that looks unlikely to happen in this instance. So rather than a climbdown, it\u2019s a logical move by Athens, Cook suggests. This is only the beginning of the solution however; nobody has accepted these plans as yet but there is a lot less within this plan to get overtly angry about. For the full story of 1953 London Agreement, check out this piece: A new idea steals across Europe \u2013 should Greece\u2019s debt be forgiven? Yanis Varoufakis is continuing his tour of Europe today, visiting Rome to meet Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Fingers crossed for another fashion triumph.... Money continues to flow into German debt this morning, even though the bonds are already extremely expensive. This has pushed the interest rate on bunds below the equivalent Japanese bond, for the first time ever. Greece\u2019s stock market is also rallying this morning, led by bank shares: Greece\u2019s three-year bond continues to jump in value, pushing down its yield to 16.64% from 19.84% last night. Another sign that default fears are easing.... City analysts are more hopeful today that Greece will avoid a confrontation with its partners that leads to its exit from the eurozone. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: While the initial debt swap proposals could well run into obstacles with respect to EU rules about monetary financing the fact that a new approach is being tried has to be welcome given how much of a disaster the current bailout program has been. The key question now is whether EU leaders and in particular the ones in Berlin, as well as the ECB are prepared to give the new proposals a decent hearing over the next few weeks as the proposals are fleshed out, or whether they get dismissed. European stock markets have all risen this morning, driven by hopes that Greece\u2019s creditors would agree to the debt swap proposal. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped 60 points, or nearly 1%. Mining stocks, which would suffer badly from an economic slowdown, are leading the risers. Greek bonds are continuing to strengthen, lowering the yield on its three-year, five-year and 10-year debt. But all three bonds still have an effective interest rate over 10%, or 18% for the three-year bonds, showing that investors are pricing in a significant default risk. Greece has asked for permission to issue \u20ac10bn in additional short-term bonds (or treasury bills) to cover the funding gap while it hammers out a new deal with its creditors. The Kathimerini newspaper has the story: According to a high-ranking official in Brussels who declined to be named, the request was submitted in Paris by Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to French counterpart Michel Sapin and European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Pierre Moscovici. Greece can currently issue a maximum of 15 billion euros in T-bills, a limit it has already reached. Varoufakis asked for the ceiling to be raised to 25 billion euros so that Greece can cover its needs during a \u201cbridge agreement\u201d ahead of a final settlement between the eurozone and Athens. Now, this might be a little awkward - given the new Greek government\u2019s blunt comments about its lenders. It\u2019s also not clear who\u2019ll buy this extra debt: Overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the latest central bank to ease monetary policy in response to weakening growth and deflation fears, as my colleagues in Australia live-blogged here: Dollar dives, shares soar as Reserve Bank cuts interest rate to 2.25% \u2013 as it happened The Greek government has insisted overnight that it \u201cwill not back down\u201d from seeking a cut in its overall debt burden. Athens appears to be stung by reports that it had dropped the plan altogether. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis confirmed that Greece hopes to use \u201cfinancial mechanical tools\u201d (ie, the debt swap explained earlier), but also claimed that some of his comments to City investors had been \u2018misinterpreted\u2019. Varoufakis added: \u201cThe essence is the same. Greek debt will become viable and will open up prospects for real growth and the Greek people will finally be able to breathe.\u201d Greek bonds have strengthened in value a little this morning, as investors react to the new debt swap plan. But yields (the interest rate on the loans) remain painfully high. The yield on the 10-year Greek bond has dropped to 11.2%, from 11.4% yesterday, still deep in the \u2018danger zone\u2019 where a country can\u2019t finance itself. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt negotiations, and other events across the world economy, finance and business. There\u2019s a sense of calm in the markets this morning after the new Greek government laid out its plan to renegotiate its some of its debt pile. And it\u2019s a more nuanced stance than some expected; Athens is asking for \u201cmenu of debt swaps\u201d to give it time and space to recover. That includes: 1) Growth Bonds, which would be linked to Greece\u2019s nominal economic growth. They would replace some of the debt held by European partners, who would only be paid if the Greek economy was growing. 2) Perpetual Bonds, to replace the debt currently held by the European Central Bank. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who outlined the plan to City investors yesterday, is dubbing the plan \u201csmart debt engineering\u201d. It won\u2019t actually involve a headline cut to Greece\u2019s debt, simply lift some of the burden of repaying it. Bloomberg TV, though, are calling it the Greek Retreat \u2013 as it\u2019s not the debt forgiveness that some voters hoped to see. If Athens got a deal, it would still commit to running a primary surplus and also implement some reforms. Varoufakis told the Financial Times that he hopes Greece\u2019s European partners will back the plan. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Help us to reform our country and give us some fiscal space to do this, otherwise we shall continue to suffocate and become a deformed rather than a reformed Greece\u2019.\u201d But will they bite? European leaders still fear that offering Greece more help will spark a flurry of requests from other countries being dragged back by austerity. And the ECB may feel that this kind of debt swap would break its rules banning monetary financing of a member state. But for now, investors are little more hopeful that the Greek drama won\u2019t blow up into a major crisis. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: There was encouragement late yesterday as the new finance minister seemed to climb down from initial demands for debt write-offs, proposing instead a bond swap arrangement; the details have yet to emerge. I\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction, and other developments, though the day....",

Labour should welcome \u201cattacks\u201d of that sort every day until 7 May. Pessina is almost a caricature of a business bogeyman. He is the man who rehomed Alliance Boots to Switzerland. Then, when he merged the business into Walgreens of the US, even the local directors objected to his ambition to flip back to Switzerland. Walgreens said it was \u201cmindful of the ongoing public reaction\u201d. If Pessina\u2019s vague musings are irrelevant, should Labour worry about more intelligent interventions from non-Mon\u00e9gasque business leaders? The short answer is yes. It\u2019s impossible to know if business opinion matters in general elections, but successful Labour administrations in the past have regarded it as helpful to have a few high-profile chairmen and chief executives in the camp. These days, however, you would be hard pressed to name a single FTSE 100 boss who would come out for Labour. But there will probably be many who will sign a letter to the Telegraph or Times expressing sympathy with some Tory policy, or bemoaning the prospect of a return to a 50p top rate of income tax under Labour. In the circumstances, there are two strategies available to the opposition. First, try to organise a retaliatory letter that demonstrates that the majority of business folk are firmly with Miliband on membership of European Union. Second, do not be afraid to examine the tax and employment records of companies where the bosses are making political statements. It is entirely legitimate to do so. There is something vulgar about the way chief executives and chairmen feel free to attach the names of their employers to their pre-election letters to newspapers, inviting the inference that they are speaking on behalf of the whole company. Bosses, at least at public companies, are hired hands. If they want to invoke the name of their employer in support of their political opinions, they should not be surprised if their policies on zero-hours contracts, tax and the like are put under the microscope. Co-op stamp of approval One strand of advice in Lord Myners\u2019 blistering report last year was crystal clear: the Co-operative Group needs better and more experienced independent non-executive directors. So far, though, only Sir Christopher Kelly, author of his own Co-op report, has joined the revolution. Simon Burke, once of HMV, has also hopped aboard, but only for a \u201ctransitional\u201d period ending in May this year. Allan Leighton, if he joins as chairman, would represent a serious upgrade. He\u2019s been around the block and earned his spurs at Asda in food retailing, an activity where the Co-op needs to get sharper in a hurry. From his Royal Mail days, Leighton also has experience of what might, euphemistically, be called an entrenched culture. He won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cup of tea at the Co-op, but that, presumably, is the point. Leighton\u2019s arrival might also give confidence to would-be outside directors that a term on the Co-op board is a safe career move. He\u2019s a promising hire. Standard dithering There are worse things in life than being paid a salary of \u00a33,000 a day to do a job you\u2019ve done for eight years, but Peter Sands at Standard Chartered may feel he deserves a better send-off than the one he\u2019s receiving. Speculation on likely replacements for Sands comes daily. Public support from the bank\u2019s two big shareholders \u2013 Aberdeen Asset Management and Temasek of Singapore \u2013 is conspicuous by its absence. Meanwhile, the share price grinds lower as City analysts downgrade their profit forecasts: another five-year low was recorded on Monday. If Sands has run out of time, and if his $400m restructuring plan is deemed too little, too late, why doesn\u2019t chairman Sir John Peace just confirm that change is afoot? Changing a bank boss is never easy, and the task is made harder these days by regulators\u2019 insistence on conducting a full checkup. But there is also a commercial danger in running for too long with a lame duck chief executive. Standard Chartered needs to get on with it.",

      "bodyText": "Age: 127. Appearance: leathery. I\u2019m not surprised, at his age. Smythson isn\u2019t a person \u2013 it\u2019s a leather goods and stationery brand of some renown, with a flagship store in Bond Street and a Royal Warrant from the Queen. Of course. I know someone who works there. You\u2019re probably thinking of Samantha Cameron, the wife of the prime minister, who used to be creative director and is still employed part-time as a consultant. No, he\u2019s called Gav. Now I think of it, he worked at Smiths, until he was replaced by an automatic till. The two concerns are not affiliated \u2013 the Y in Smythson is long: s-MY-sthon. Both solid British businesses, though. Well, sort of. What do you mean, sort of? Smythson may be the epitome of British luxury, but in 2009 it was bought by businessman Jacques Bahbout, who purchased it through his Italian handbag manufacturing concern Tivoli Group. SamCam, as a director, received an estimated \u00a330k bonus when the sale went through. Sounds fair enough. According to reports, Smythson is now controlled by a holding company called Holdsmyth Ltd, which is in turn owned by Greenwill SA, a company incorporated in Luxembourg. According to documents filed at Companies House, Greenwill itself is ultimately controlled by The Barracuda Trust, in Guernsey. What does it all mean? It means that Smythson is actually based in a tax haven, or even two tax havens. Isn\u2019t that sort of embarrassing news for David Cameron? It is. The PM has spoken out about tax avoidance many times, usually with reference to multinationals including Starbucks and Amazon. Typical. They go over there, they sell our posh clobber and they don\u2019t even pay any tax! Actually, Holdsmyth Ltd has paid just over a million quid in tax in the past six years. Huh. Do they not understand what a tax haven is for? But when it comes to dividends paid out \u2013 not to mention any future sale of the business \u2013 it\u2019s possible that the company could benefit from the low tax regimes it currently spreads itself across. Do say: \u201cThat this arrangement is perfectly legal and shows the urgent need for European tax reform.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a3450 for the handbag.

Do they not understand what a tax haven is for? </strong>But when it comes to dividends paid out \u2013 not to mention any future sale of the business \u2013 it\u2019s possible that the company could benefit from the low tax regimes it currently spreads itself across.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>\u201cThat this arrangement is perfectly legal and shows the urgent need for European tax reform.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say: </strong>\u201cThat\u2019s \u00a3450 for the handbag.

    "webTitle": "BP makes $1bn loss as oil prices slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP plans to cut its exploration activity in half and reduce overall spending by 20% after crashing to a $1bn (\u00a3660m) loss in the final quarter of the year as a result of low oil prices. Its chief executive, Bob Dudley, said a \u201craging gale\u201d was sweeping through the industry and he believed it could be years before there was a significant bounce-back in the value of Brent crude. Asked exactly how low crude prices could go and how long that might last, especially since prices have risen slightly in recent days, Dudley said: \u201cIt feels like 1986 to me,\u201d referring to a dramatic period when the price plunged from $40 to $9. Dudley\u2019s comments came as BG, another British-based oil and gas group, underlined the depth of the problems facing the sector when it wrote down the value of its assets by $9bn and reported a pre-tax annual loss of $2.3bn. \u201cWe have now entered a new and challenging phase of low oil prices through the near and medium term,\u201d warned Dudley: \u201cOur focus must now be on resetting BP: managing and rebalancing our capital programme and cost base for the new reality of lower prices while always maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations.\u201d The company took a $6.5bn writedown charge \u2013 $3.6bn after tax \u2013 on the value of its North Sea and other fields to reflect the fall in oil prices from $115 per barrel last June to $56 today. The drop was largely responsible for BP reporting a $969m (\u00a3645m) replacement cost loss in the final three months of the year compared with a profit of $1.5bn for the same period last year. The underlying replacement cost loss \u2013 a \u201cclean\u201d figure preferred by analysts \u2013 came in at $2.2bn, compared with $2.8bn last time, helped by an unexpectedly high contribution of $470m from its holdings in Moscow-based Rosneft. Dudley unexpectedly said he was still keen to invest further in Russia, saying that there were opportunities to expand even with western sanctions in place, but BP admitted that it expected to see the annual dividend from Rosneft to BP cut in half to about $350m this summer. Shares in BP fell by more than 2% in early trading despite the company raising the dividend for investors to 10c, but analysts at the broker Jefferies liked what they saw. \u201cCompared to peers, we believe BP has offered one of the most responsive outlooks to the lower near-term crude environment,\u201d it said in a research note. The troubled oil company, which has in the past been a subject of takeover speculation, said it would be slashing its spending for 2015 to $20bn, down from a target of between $24bn to $25bn in 2014. Among the projects that are being put on hold is the multibillion-dollar Mad Dog development in the Gulf of Mexico. BP also revealed it had spent $43.5bn on fines and other liabilities resulting from the Deepwater Horizon blowout of 2010. It could still face charges of $13.7bn under a Clean Water Act, but is hopeful it can avoid this and has only set aside $3.5bn in its accounts to pay for this contingency. BP admitted it was difficult to judge the final financial impact of the Deepwater Horizon accident. \u201cThe total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all the obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty, and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors. These could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results and cashflows,\u201d it said in a statement accompanying the accounts. BP made no comment on the impact of its new spending cuts on jobs. The company, which has cut hundreds of jobs in Aberdeen and thousands around the world, has also frozen pay for its 84,000-strong workforce. Last week the British-based oil company raised more cash to pay for its Gulf liabilities by handing over a larger stake and operatorship of the Gila and Tiber fields in US waters to Chevron and ConocoPhillips. Meanwhile, BG said it would reduce investment by almost a third this year to between \u00a34bn and \u00a34.7bn and gave a downbeat assessment of prospects for oil in Britain. Andrew Gould, the BG chairman, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can, at these oil prices, hope for a major resurgence of the North Sea on the basis that there are a lot of other places in the world where the reserves\u2019 life is a lot more promising than it is in the UK sector of the North Sea.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s builders enjoyed a rebound in business growth last month but have gone into the new year in a cautious mood amid signs of an economic slowdown. After expansion in the construction sector hit a 17-month low in December, it enjoyed faster growth in January in all three areas \u2013 homebuilding, civil engineering and commercial construction \u2013 according to the latest Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI survey. But the report showed that growth was less strong than the average for last year and hiring slowed to its weakest pace for more than a year as worries about the outlook intensified. Construction firms also reported continuing challenges in getting the materials they need as suppliers adjust to a revival in demand since the industry\u2019s sharp recession. Skilled workers were also hard to come by, sending subcontractor charges rising at a near record pace, the survey said. The poll\u2019s main activity index rose to 59.1, from 57.6 in December, defying expectations for a drop to 57.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cUK construction companies have found their feet again after a protracted slowdown in output growth at the end of 2014,\u201d said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and the report\u2019s author. \u201cStronger trends were recorded across housing, commercial and civil engineering, although each category of activity still experienced much slower growth than the high-water marks achieved last year. In short, the peak speed of the construction recovery seems to be over, but reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.\u201d Almost half of those surveyed forecast a rise in business activity over the next 12 months, while fewer than one in 10 expect a drop. But the report, based on questionnaires sent to purchasing executives in more than 170 construction companies, highlighted a mood of caution seen in several other recent business surveys. \u201cThe degree of business optimism was the second-lowest since October 2013, with some firms citing heightened uncertainty about the overall economic outlook.\u201d The survey follows official data last week that showed the UK economy losing momentum at the end of 2014. The figures showed construction, which accounts for about 6% of the economy, was the worst performing sector as output dropped 1.8% on the quarter. The mixed construction report follows news that factory activity accelerated last month, according to Markit\u2019s sister survey of the manufacturing sector. That report also showed manufacturers\u2019 costs fell on the back of tumbling oil prices, reinforcing economists\u2019 forecasts that cheaper crude will support UK growth this year. \u201cWith tonnes of stimulus in the pipeline, from low oil prices to now rising real wages, economic growth is shaping up to accelerate through the first half of this year,\u201d said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the German bank Berenberg.",

The proposed dismantling of the Delta platform comes at a time when some industry executives have raised the prospects of major shutdowns because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/07/oil-price-brent-crude-falls-below-50-barrel\" title=\"\">the price of crude</a> \u2013 the benchmark price is named after the Brent field \u2013 has dropped by 60% in the past seven months.</p> <p>Shell believes the decommissioning industry is a sizable opportunity in its own right. \u201cIt\u2019s far from a gloomy scenario,\u201d said Erik Bonino, the Shell UK chairman. \u201cNorth Sea oil and gas fields offer the UK the chance to create a world-class hub for the safe and responsible decommissioning of platforms and pipelines. We have the potential to develop expertise that can be exported throughout the world, from the Gulf of Mexico to the South China Sea, and create thousands of highly skilled jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next 30 years, almost all the 470 offshore installations, such as platforms, in the North Sea\u2019s UK continental shelf will need to be decommissioned, according to Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s 2013 economic report. That means expenditure of \u00a335bn to \u00a350bn, at least as much as the UK government plans to spend on the railway network over the next five years, says Shell.</p> <p>In 1995, Shell took the decision to dump the Brent Spar into the North Sea but was heavily criticised for the lack of consultation.</p> <p>Bonino said : \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that did not happen two decades ago when we decommissioned Brent Spar, a redundant oil storage installation in the North Sea. Although the technical and scientific assessments led to our initial plan to safely sink Brent Spar in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean [a plan supported by the government at the time], we failed to engage sufficiently with others and win public acceptance.\u201d</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Shell is to start the process on Tuesday which will lead to the dismantling of a platform on the Brent oil field in the North Sea, closing a chapter in Britain\u2019s post-war industrial history. At its peak Brent, which was discovered in 1971, 115 miles east of the Shetland Islands, was producing half a million barrels a day, more than half Britain\u2019s current total output, but Shell has decided to decommission the former cornerstone of the UK oil industry now that its output has dwindled. The Anglo-Dutch group is beginning consultations on a plan to remove the topside of the 23,500 tonne Brent Delta platform, which stands higher than the Eiffel Tower and is one of four platforms in the field, and transport it by sea to Teesside for onshore demolition. The 30-day public consultation will rekindle one of the most controversial episodes in offshore history when Shell\u2019s 1995 plans to bury a Brent Spar storage buoy in the sea triggered a huge stand-off with environmental activists Greenpeace. Various options for turning the massive steel structure into a windfarm, offshore prison or even a casino have been turned down in favour of its complete removal. \u201cWe hope many people will play an active part in the consultation,\u201d said Alistair Hope, the Brent decommissioning project director at Shell. \u201cThe Brent field has been a prolific national asset for many years, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs and contributing billions of pounds to the UK government.\u201d If this part of the operation obtains approval from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, a second decommissioning programme will follow for the remaining parts of Brent infrastructure, including 140 wells and 28 pipelines. Shell claims the field has produced 4bn barrels of oil equivalents over four decades, almost 10% of the UK North Sea total, but is now close to the end of its life. Brent is not the first North Sea field to be taken out of commission but it is one of the biggest and best known. The proposed dismantling of the Delta platform comes at a time when some industry executives have raised the prospects of major shutdowns because the price of crude \u2013 the benchmark price is named after the Brent field \u2013 has dropped by 60% in the past seven months. Shell believes the decommissioning industry is a sizable opportunity in its own right. \u201cIt\u2019s far from a gloomy scenario,\u201d said Erik Bonino, the Shell UK chairman. \u201cNorth Sea oil and gas fields offer the UK the chance to create a world-class hub for the safe and responsible decommissioning of platforms and pipelines. We have the potential to develop expertise that can be exported throughout the world, from the Gulf of Mexico to the South China Sea, and create thousands of highly skilled jobs.\u201d Over the next 30 years, almost all the 470 offshore installations, such as platforms, in the North Sea\u2019s UK continental shelf will need to be decommissioned, according to Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s 2013 economic report. That means expenditure of \u00a335bn to \u00a350bn, at least as much as the UK government plans to spend on the railway network over the next five years, says Shell. In 1995, Shell took the decision to dump the Brent Spar into the North Sea but was heavily criticised for the lack of consultation. Bonino said : \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that did not happen two decades ago when we decommissioned Brent Spar, a redundant oil storage installation in the North Sea. Although the technical and scientific assessments led to our initial plan to safely sink Brent Spar in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean [a plan supported by the government at the time], we failed to engage sufficiently with others and win public acceptance.\u201d",
