      "bodyText": "The 10th anniversary of the worst downturn since the Great Depression finds the global economy at risk of a fresh crisis and ill-prepared for the disruption likely from the robot age, the World Economic Forum has warned. The body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos each January used its annual league table of competitiveness to stress that the failure to push through growth and productivity-friendly policies since the crash of 2007-08 had jeopardised chances of a sustained recovery. WEF sources said recent Bank of England concerns about a potential consumer debt crisis were timely since there was evidence that the global banking system was less sound than before the financial crisis and that conditions were deteriorating in some parts of the world. Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned of a \u201cdangerous\u201d growth in China\u2019s debt. The WEF said there was also a need to combine labour market flexibility with enhanced rights for workers, with countries that had managed to do so enjoying higher employment and lower levels of inequality. Zero-hours contracts were a \u201csticking plaster\u201d rather than a long-term solution, it added. According to the 12 criteria used by the WEF, Switzerland retained its place as the world\u2019s most competitive country in this year\u2019s standings. The next four countries in the table were the US, Singapore, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK slipped one place to eighth, although the WEF said the decline was due to a better performance from other countries rather than the impact of the Brexit vote. The UK\u2019s overall competitiveness score was the highest since the WEF started using its current method of calculating competitiveness a decade ago. The 12 categories looked at in the WEF report are institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labour market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation. Britain\u2019s weakest performance was in the macroeconomic environment where the persistence of a large budget deficit meant it ranked 68th in the world. In the other 11 areas, the UK was in the top 20, ranking fourth in technological readiness \u2013 the category highlighted by the WEF as essential if countries were to make the most of the new wave of innovation. \u201cGlobal competitiveness will be more and more defined by the innovative capacity of a country. Talents will become increasingly more important than capital and therefore the world is moving from the age of capitalism into the age of talentism. Countries preparing for the fourth industrial revolution and simultaneously strengthening their political, economic and social systems will be the winners in the competitive race of the future,\u201d said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. Further down the league table, there was little evidence that the pick-up in growth in the eurozone had boosted the competitiveness of the bigger economies or narrowed the region\u2019s north-south divide. France dropped one place to 22, and there was little change in the rankings for Spain (34), Italy (43), or Greece (87).",

      "bodyText": "The American Chamber of Commerce in Europe has warned that the EU\u2019s plans to take more tax from technology giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon will damage the continent\u2019s economic growth and could lead to a breakdown in cooperation with the US on global tax reform. The European commission, on the prompting of France and Germany, is seeking ways to capture a greater amount of tax from companies that exploit their lack of physical offices in a country to book their profits in low-tax states. Taxing tech companies is on the agenda of an EU leaders\u2019 summit devoted to the digital economy in Tallinn, Estonia, on Friday. A recent study found that Amazon\u2019s corporation tax bill in the UK is 11 times smaller than that of British bookstores. In Ireland, the European commission concluded that Apple paid 0.005% to Irish tax authorities in 2014. France is pushing a proposal to tax technology companies on turnover, rather than a conventional corporation tax on profits. It has won support from 10 EU member states, including Germany, Italy and Spain. The commission\u2019s first choice, meanwhile, is a common corporate tax base for companies aimed at introducing a common set of tax rules, but not rates, in order to prevent the hiding of profits from the appropriate tax authorities. The development is just the latest move by Brussels to try and keep pace with the activities of tech companies. On Tuesday it was reported that Google is to create a standalone unit for its shopping service and require it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page, in an effort to oblige with an EU ruling that it was abusing its monopolistic position in the internet search market by artificially promoting its service. The company had been given a deadline of this Thursday to provide a remedy when it was fined a record \u20ac2.4bn in June. Neither the company nor the European commission commented. Some have accused Brussels of having a vendetta against Silicon Valley. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (AmCham EU) said on Tuesday that they were concerned \u201cby the recent proposals from the European commission and some member states to introduce new measures to tax digital activities\u201d, adding that it would make Europe less attractive to investors. The US business organisation added that the initiatives had been floated by Brussels last week without any assessment of the impact and that they \u201ccould both harm the competitiveness of the EU and jeopardise international efforts to tackle tax issues if they are not subject to very broad multilateral agreement\u201d. A statement said: \u201cTurnover taxes, as proposed by some member states, can substantially reduce the amount of company profits available for investment and reinvestment, with a negative effect on jobs and growth. \u201cThey penalise startups, low-margin companies and loss-making companies because they do not seek to tax the value created. \u201cThe European commission\u2019s proposal to consider including digital taxation under the scope of the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) may also adversely affect EU competitiveness and growth if it is not in line with internationally agreed rules on value creation.\u201d During a meeting of finance ministers in Estonia two weeks ago, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond spoke of his concern that unilateral efforts to clamp down on the tax affairs of US technology companies would be met with retaliation from Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The EU is working with the US on a rewriting of global tax laws to avoid aggressive tax avoidance. Susan Danger, chief executive of AmCham EU, said: \u2018Unilateral action by the EU would seriously undermine international efforts to address tax issues. \u201cThe EU should continue to support tax reforms and the harmonisation of tax regimes within the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] framework.\u201d Danger went on to say: \u201cCurrent EU plans risk putting Europe at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other global players. Internationally agreed-upon tax standards ensure the EU remains an attractive destination for foreign investment\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here comes Simon Breakwell, hauled from the crew of non-executive directors, to perform running repairs on the AA as its new chief executive. His first tweak? A delay to an IT upgrade and a warning that an extra \u00a335m must be spent. The shares hit another all-time low. On the plus side, boring talk about computers makes a change from recent excitement, such as last month\u2019s removal of executive chairman Bob Mackenzie for gross misconduct after an altercation with a colleague in the bar of a Surrey hotel. We\u2019ll leave the two sides\u2019 lawyers to chew over the details of the incident and ask a different question. How is that the AA, which ought to be the model of a dull and reliable investment, has performed so dreadfully for shareholders? The core product, a roadside breakdown service, is a must-have for most motorists. The brand is well known, the field of direct competitors is small and the cash flows are mostly solid. Steady progress ought to be easy. Instead, the AA\u2019s have fallen by a third since it has brought to market via a management buy-in in 2014. The short explanation is debt \u2013 too much of it. The AA arrived from the world of private equity, in this case CVC and Permira, and has continued the same aggressive financing model (with potential jackpots for executives, naturally) in the public arena. Most mature consumer-based companies might regard borrowings of two times trading profits as a tolerable upper limit. At the AA, Tuesday\u2019s half-year results showed a net debt ratio of 6.7 times, unchanged on a year ago. That\u2019s fine (ish) only if you avoid potholes. But financial gearing also works in reverse, why is why the AA grumbled so loudly about changes in insurance taxes and the regulator\u2019s demand for transparency on renewal quotes. Those events \u2013 hardly exceptional \u2013 had already helped to push shares back down from a high of 420p to the float price of 250p before Mackenzie\u2019s exit. Now they\u2019re at 157p as investors wonder where AA is going next. This is a company worth \u00a31bn towing a \u00a32.7bn caravan of debt. Breakwell will unveil the fruits of his review next year, but a focus is insurance. That seems sensible given that the AA has 3.3 million roadside members and only 616,000 car insurance policies. Rather than combine with an established insurer \u2013 there were brief talks with Hastings \u2013 the plan is for the AA to do more underwriting directly, which is where the real money is made. Fine, but how are you going to pay for it? Underwriting requires upfront capital, and the AA\u2019s heavy annual interest payments, plus a deficit in its pension fund, don\u2019t obviously leave much loose change. The roadside business does indeed generate lots of cash but even an extra \u00a335m for IT hurts. Breakwell insists there are funds to invest, but the open question is how much. Investors can kick the tyres on the plan when it arrives. For the time being, the market\u2019s judgment looks correct: the AA is a classic tale of a lovely business spoiled by financial games. The original private equity backers have an excuse of sorts \u2013 aggressive financing is what they do. It\u2019s hard to understand why the big City funds agreed to follow the same sat-nav. Tolerating almost seven times leverage at a listed company that has been through the private equity\u2019s wringer was asking for trouble. Equifax scores lowly on corporate governamce If you think UK directors get off lightly when calamity strikes, you can always rely on a US company to redefine the meaning of reward for failure. By rights, Richard Smith would have lost his job as chairman and chief executive of Equifax when the huge credit-scoring firm confessed a fortnight ago to a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 143 million people. After all, you will struggle to promote yourself a \u201cconsumer advocate\u201d if you can\u2019t be trusted to protect the public\u2019s sensitive information and then wait weeks to tell the world about one of the biggest cyber-raids seen in the US. As the share price tumbled, Smith somehow clung on. Now he\u2019s gone, but what a send-off he received. Smith wasn\u2019t sacked, he \u201cretired\u201d with expressions of \u201cappreciation\u201d from the board. The man himself said it had been an honour to serve. But, actually, it was more than an honour. He was paid $14.9m (\u00a311m) last year and, by calling his departure a retirement, Equifax is presumably signalling that it doesn\u2019t intend to claw back a dollar of his bonus. Governance is far from perfect in the UK, but a FTSE 100 firm would struggle to get away with such a brazen manoeuvre.",

      "body": "<p>Here comes Simon Breakwell, hauled from the crew of non-executive directors, to perform running repairs on the AA as its new chief executive. His first tweak? A delay to an IT upgrade and a warning that an extra \u00a335m must be spent. The shares hit another all-time low.</p> <p>On the plus side, boring talk about computers makes a change from recent excitement, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/01/aa-shares-plunge-as-boss-is-fired-for-gross-misconduct\">last month\u2019s removal of executive chairman Bob Mackenzie</a> for gross misconduct after an altercation with a colleague in the bar of a Surrey hotel. We\u2019ll leave the two sides\u2019 lawyers to chew over the details of the incident and ask a different question. How is that the AA, which ought to be the model of a dull and reliable investment, has performed so dreadfully for shareholders?</p> <p>The core product, a roadside breakdown service, is a must-have for most motorists. The brand is well known, the field of direct competitors is small and the cash flows are mostly solid. Steady progress ought to be easy. Instead, the AA\u2019s have fallen by a third since it has brought to market via a management buy-in in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The short explanation is debt \u2013 too much of it. The AA arrived from the world of private equity, in this case CVC and Permira, and has continued the same aggressive financing model (with potential jackpots for executives, naturally) in the public arena. Most mature consumer-based companies might regard borrowings of two times trading profits as a tolerable upper limit. At the AA, Tuesday\u2019s half-year results showed a net debt ratio of 6.7 times, unchanged on a year ago.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine (ish) only if you avoid potholes. But financial gearing also works in reverse, why is why the AA grumbled so loudly about changes in insurance taxes and the regulator\u2019s demand for transparency on renewal quotes. Those events \u2013 hardly exceptional \u2013 had already helped to push shares back down from a high of 420p to the float price of 250p before Mackenzie\u2019s exit. Now they\u2019re at 157p as investors wonder where AA is going next. This is a company worth \u00a31bn towing a \u00a32.7bn caravan of debt.</p> <p>Breakwell will unveil the fruits of his review next year, but a focus is insurance. That seems sensible given that the AA has 3.3 million roadside members and only 616,000 car insurance policies. Rather than combine with an established insurer \u2013 there were brief talks with Hastings \u2013 the plan is for the AA to do more underwriting directly, which is where the real money is made.</p> <p>Fine, but how are you going to pay for it? Underwriting requires upfront capital, and the AA\u2019s heavy annual interest payments, plus a deficit in its pension fund, don\u2019t obviously leave much loose change. The roadside business does indeed generate lots of cash but even an extra \u00a335m for IT hurts. Breakwell insists there are funds to invest, but the open question is how much.</p> <p>Investors can kick the tyres on the plan when it arrives. For the time being, the market\u2019s judgment looks correct: the AA is a classic tale of a lovely business spoiled by financial games. The original private equity backers have an excuse of sorts \u2013 aggressive financing is what they do. It\u2019s hard to understand why the big City funds agreed to follow the same sat-nav. Tolerating almost seven times leverage at a listed company that has been through the private equity\u2019s wringer was asking for trouble.</p> <h2>Equifax scores lowly on corporate governamce</h2> <p>If you think UK directors get off lightly when calamity strikes, you can always rely on a US company to redefine the meaning of reward for failure. By rights, Richard Smith would have lost his job as chairman and chief executive of Equifax when the huge credit-scoring firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/07/equifax-credit-breach-hack-social-security\">confessed a fortnight ago</a> to a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 143 million people.</p> <p>After all, you will struggle to promote yourself a \u201cconsumer advocate\u201d if you can\u2019t be trusted to protect the public\u2019s sensitive information and then wait weeks to tell the world about one of the biggest cyber-raids seen in the US. As the share price tumbled, Smith somehow clung on.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/equifax-boss-richard-smith-retires-data-breach\">Now he\u2019s gone</a>, but what a send-off he received. Smith wasn\u2019t sacked, he \u201cretired\u201d with expressions of \u201cappreciation\u201d from the board. The man himself said it had been an honour to serve. But, actually, it was more than an honour. He was paid $14.9m (\u00a311m) last year and, by calling his departure a retirement, Equifax is presumably signalling that it doesn\u2019t intend to claw back a dollar of his bonus. Governance is far from perfect in the UK, but a FTSE 100 firm would struggle to get away with such a brazen manoeuvre.</p>",

      "bodyText": "And here is the sign-off in Yellen\u2019s speech: To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC\u2019s outlook that, with gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will stabilize at around the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening in labor market conditions. But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and other factors. As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here are Yellen\u2019s quotes on the pace of interest rate changes: How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Moving too quickly risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass. A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock. But we should also be wary of moving too gradually. Job gains continue to run well ahead of the longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession. Persistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications for financial stability. For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent. After last week\u2019s Fed meeting, Yellen admitted the central bank did not really understand why inflation had not returned to target. In her Ohio speech, she says: Key among current uncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions. ...This low inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time. But .. many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent. My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation. In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability. Yellen\u2019s comments have pushed the US dollar index to its highest level since August 31, as investors bet another rise is coming. Yellen\u2019s speech can be seen here. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has hinted at further rate rises, prompting renewed suggestions a December move is on the cards. Last week\u2019s Fed meeting seemed to indicate as much, and in a speech in Ohio Yellen said it would be imprudent to leave rates on hold until inflation reached 2%. But she added that the current uncertainties strengthened the case for gradual rate rises, although the Fed had to be careful not to move too gradually. The risk of a stock market fall seems to be growing, reckons Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: After Monday\u2019s sell-off, Wall Street opened sharply higher as downbeat tech names found support on \u201cbargain\u201d hunting and amid short-side profit-taking. However, the gains appeared to be short-lived as at the time of this writing, the major indices were coming off their best levels again. I still think a major correction could be on the cards soon, possibly in the coming days. With US stock markets holding near their all-time highs and volatility being suppressed to record low levels, I just can\u2019t help but feel investors are becoming unjustifiably complacent. Valuations have already become overstretched and at some point even the most bullish of market participants will have to accept that. A growing number of analysts agree that the bullish run cannot continue rising at this pace for much longer, at least without a sizeable correction of some sort. One also has to remember that the number one reason why stocks are where they are is because of the unprecedented era of cheap central bank money flooding the financial markets. But with the Federal Reserve set to normalise its balance sheet, monetary conditions are going to tighten in the US. While the Bank of Japan will pick up the slack, a growing number of other central banks are turning or have already turned hawkish. The Bank of Canada has already started raising interest rates, while the Bank of England is set to do so in the coming months. The European Central Bank will likely announce the start of its own QE tapering soon. Investors remained cautious, in the wake of the continuing tensions between the US and North Korea and the outcome of the German election. So European markets ended the day little moved, while in the US, Wall Street lost some of its early gains but so far has remained in positive territory. The dollar recovered but the euro remained weak, while oil slipped back from its 26 month highs as profit takers moved in. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 15.55 points or 0.21% at 7285.74 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.08% to 12,605.20 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.03% to 5268.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.18% better at 22,430.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.26% at 10,189.6 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% to 740.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 9 points or 0.04%. The pound remains ahead against the euro but lower against the dollar. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The euro continued to hog the limelight this Tuesday, as investors chew over the various German, French and Spanish issues facing the Eurozone. Down half a percent against the dollar, the euro is now sitting at a fresh month low of around $1.178. Against sterling it is doing a tiny bit better; though the euro\u2019s still at an effective 2 month low, it has halved its losses to 0.2%, forcing the pound back below \u20ac1.14. That\u2019s because sterling has been softened up by former MPC member David Blanchflower\u2019s warning [in the Guardian] that there is \u2018absolutely no basis\u2019 for a rate hike in November, a comment that also dragged cable lower by 0.4% fall. All this was further complicated by the hawkish signals sent out by New York Fed President William Dudley, who claimed the rate hike obstacles facing the Fed are \u2018fading\u2019... Still to come this Tuesday is a speech from Janet Yellen, tantalisingly titled \u2018Inflation, Uncertainty and Monetary Policy\u2019. That\u2019s potentially attention-grabbing stuff for investors \u2013 even if these kinds of talks can end up providing less insight than hoped for \u2013 with the dollar looking to extend today\u2019s gains with a few juicy hawkish morsels. Oil prices have fallen from their highs after profit takers moved in. Brent crude had risen to more than $59 a barrel, its highest level since July 2015, on a combination of growing demand, Opec production cuts and Turkey\u2019s threat to shut the pipeline that runs from Northern Iraq through Turkey to the port of Ceyhan. But it has slipped back just over 1% to $58.39 as investors decided to cash in some of their gains. American consumers were less confident in September than the previous month, partly due to the impact of the recent hurricanes. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index came in at 119.8 this month, below the expected level of 120. It was also below August\u2019s figure of 120.4, itself revised down from 122.9. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the board, said: Consumer confidence decreased slightly in September after a marginal improvement in August. Confidence in Texas and Florida, however, decreased considerably, as these two states were the most severely impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Despite the slight downtick in confidence, consumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions remains quite favorable and their expectations for the short-term suggest the economy will continue expanding at its current pace. US markets have moved ahead at the start of trading, as technology stocks recovered from Monday\u2019s falls. But investors remained nervous amid the continuing tensions between North Korea and the US. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 50 points or 0.23% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.37%. Back with oil, and the latest surge may not continued but the market may now be better balanced, says Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics: The latest rise in oil prices reflects concerns about Kurdish supply and hopes for another extension of OPEC\u2019s output cuts, neither of which may have a lasting influence on prices. But the oil market has become better balanced over the past year, suggesting that prices should remain fairly stable... There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices. Most significantly, the underlying demand and supply for oil have been coming into balance over the past year or so. There has been a steady increase in demand as global growth has picked up. And the increase in supply has been constrained by the OPEC-led production cuts, for which compliance has continued to be surprisingly good. More recently, leading OPEC members have hinted that they may extend their production cuts of 1.8 million bpd beyond March 2018. This in turn is partly a response to oil stocks not dropping back as rapidly as OPEC members had hoped, due to a surge in oil production by Nigeria, Libya and the US. And prices jumped in the past day or so due to yesterday\u2019s unofficial referendum on independence in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkey\u2019s threat to close the pipeline for Kurdish oil exports. Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region produces around 650,000 bpd, the bulk of which goes through Turkey. We suspect that the latest surge in oil prices marks the end of an upward trend. Admittedly, some kind of deal to extend the OPEC cuts is now likely, but it is not a done deal as there are several obstacles to be overcome...And Turkey is unlikely to block Kurdish oil exports unless tensions in the region escalate dramatically. Looking further ahead, it seems likely that oil prices will be fairly stable in the coming years. Not only are global demand and supply now better balanced, but several \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d should take effect. A significant increase in prices would lead to higher shale production and weaker OPEC compliance, and a significant decrease may well prompt OPEC to reinforce its agreement to restrict supply. Our forecast remains for Brent crude to end this year and next at $57pb and $55pb respectively. Over in the US, the boss of credit reporting agency Equifax is leaving after a data breach which exposed personal data of 143m Americans. Richard Smith is stepping down as chief executive after 12 years in the top job. The company\u2019s management had come under fire for lax security and its response to the hacking, which took place in May. Over in Greece, bank shares have suffered an alarming plunge, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Shares have been sliding since the IMF announced that it wanted to conduct a bank asset review as part of a third bailout compliance review with Greece. The prospect of multiple stress tests would further highlight Greek lenders\u2019 huge non-performing loan problem. This fear was reinforced yesterday when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi hinted that the Single Supervisory Mechanism may front-load stress tests for Greek banks, once again raising the prospect that banks would need more capital. Shares have fallen further on news that banks will float fresh plans to reduce NPLs early next month. Shares in Alpha Bank, Attica Bank and Piraeus Bank have all tumbled by at least 10%, while National Bank of Greece has lost over 6%. The spectre of shrinkflation is stalking through the UK economy again today - and this time Jaffa Cakes are the victims. Manufacturer McVities is facing a revolt after reducing the number of Jaffa Cakes in each pack from 12 to just 10. Fans of the orange-centred snack are outraged..... McVities are trying to calm the storm (which the BBC have seen fit to dub \u2018Jaffa Quake\u2019...), insisting that wholesale prices have also been cut. A spokesperson also insists that the firm haven\u2019t done a Toblerone and messed around with the sizing, saying: \u201cThere is no change in the size, shape or weight of individual cakes in the McVitie\u2019s Jaffa Cake range.\u201d But, there are reports that some shops are selling the new downsized Jaffa Cakes at the old price! It\u2019s turning into the biggest Jaffa Cake row since the British taxman tried to prove they were actually biscuits. The drop in the pound has driven up the cost of sugar, chocolate and flour for UK producers, so this may not be the last example of shrinkflation. Still, Jaffa Cake fans who can\u2019t cope with less than a dozen in one sitting could always make their own... The Unite union is urging the UK government to raise its efforts to protect jobs at Bombardier\u2019s Belfast factory. Assistant general secretary Tony Burke says Bombardier workers are \u201cholding their breath\u201d ahead of today\u2019s ruling on the trade dispute with Boeing. Burke adds: \u201cThe prime minister and the government need to make it clear to Trump they will not stand back and watch our members jobs and our communities threatened like this. \u201cMrs May needs to stand up for our members in the aerospace industry and for decent jobs and for manufacturing in the U.K.\u201d More here: Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire is currently meeting the Unite union in Belfast to hear their fears over a legal ruling in the United States that could put thousands of jobs in peril at the Bombardier aerospace factory in the east of the city. Unite and the 4,000 plus workforce at the East Belfast plant are waiting anxiously for news on a ruling in the United States over claims by rival plane-maker Boeing that Bombardier received anti-competitive state support in Canada. Boeing\u2019s legal action, which the US Department of Commerce and US International Trade Commission will adjudicate on later on Tuesday, relates to Bombardier winning a contract to make the wings for Delta Airlines C-Series aircraft. The wings are constructed in Bombardier\u2019s Belfast base. Unite told The Guardian the union will remind Secretary of State Brokenshire that the UK government has extensive contracts with Boeing in particular for purchasing military aircraft from the American aerospace giant. The union wants the Cabinet in London to apply greater pressure on Boeing to end its legal action against its rival. Boeing has argued that a \u00a3750 million support grant to Bombardier from the Quebec regional government in Canada two years ago that rescued the company from bankruptcy breaks US anti-competition laws and is tantamount to illegal state support for their rival. The Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard has just been launched, showing how the UK economy is faring since last June\u2019s EU referendum. This month, the dashboard shows that the pound has recovered to its highest levels since the vote, but that hasn\u2019t stopped inflation hitting four-year highs. Here\u2019s the full piece: So with real wages still falling, former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower argues that this is no time to raise borrowing costs. The euro has fallen sharply this week against the Swiss franc, as well as the US dollar and the pound. Piotr Bujak, chief economist at PKO Bank Polski, has tweeted the details: The euro is also suffering from jitters ahead of Catalan\u2019s independence referendum. The Catalan government plans to hold a referendum on whether to break away from Spain on Sunday, despite opposition from Spanish authorities. Madrid is trying to prevent the vote by confiscating millions of ballot papers, after the nation\u2019s constitutional court declared the referendum illegal. Last week, at least 12 people were arrested when police raided Catalan government offices. The situation is threatening to escalate further; on Monday, Spain\u2019s attorney general refused to rule out the possibility of arresting the Catalan president himself. The Catalan and Kurdish votes are a double-dose of worry for the markets, as Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: The impending Catalonian referendum is certainly a fear for many within the EU, with the result providing the potential for ongoing conflict in the region. Referendums are clearly a major market driver at the moment, with the Iraqi Kurdistan vote being a potential disruption to the region\u2019s oil supply. As President Erdogan threatens to cut off the Kurdistan oil pipelines, it comes as no surprise that we have seen another leg higher for Brent, which hit a two-year high yesterday. The pound has hit a 10-week high against the euro, as worries over the German election continue to drag the single currency down. Sterling has risen by 0.3% this morning to \u20ac1.14 for the first time since 14 July. This may annoy British holidaymakers who swapped pounds for euros in the summer holidays, as the pound fell during August to just \u20ac1.08, an eight year low. The euro has also dipped against the US dollar, to a one-month low of $1.1822, extending Monday\u2019s selloff. Investors are selling the euro because they expect it will take Angela Merkel many weeks to hammer out a new coalition (most likely with the Free Democrats and the Greens). The success of the far-right AfD party is also a concern, as it may restrain Merkel from driving closer eurozone integration. Ian Ormiston, manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, reckons Merkel has been \u201cdiminished\u201d, despite winning a fourth term as chancellor: We will have protracted coalition talks as the socialist SPD party have indicated that they wish to lead the opposition and so the most likely grouping is centre right CDU/CSU, pro-business FDP and left-leaning Gr\u00fcne (Green) party. This is likely to bring minor policy shifts at home, and more importantly, slow the momentum towards greater European integration which was building following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s election as president of France. This will disappoint those that wanted European rebalancing led by more expansionary German fiscal policy and those that hope for an expansion of European structures to cope with the next crisis. For equity markets, we can probably look for more of the same, modest but adequate growth across the region and political pragmatism having little impact on earnings and valuations. In contrast, the pound is still benefitting from the prospect of a UK interest rate rise soon, perhaps at the Bank of England\u2019s next meeting in early November. Just in: Britons took a break from hammering their credit cards last month, and dipped into their savings instead. That\u2019s according to new industry data from UK Finance, which suggests households are being squeezed hard by inflation and low wage growth. The figures show that annual growth in personal deposits with high street banks fell to 2.2% in August, in the weakest month since May 2009. Consumer borrowing from High Street banks slowed to 1.5% in August, down from 1.9% in July. Our economics correspondent Richard Partington explains: The trade body suggested consumers are saving a bit less each month, as opposed to borrowing more, amid a modest decline in the growth of credit card and personal loans. \u201cIt seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing,\u201d it said. Annual growth in credit card borrowing was 5% in August, compared to 5.3% in the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. The figures may show that recent warnings from the Bank of England against reckless lending have reached lenders\u2019 ears. But the drop in savings growth highlights that households may be ill-prepared for an economic downturn. UK Finance also reported that 41,807 mortgages were approved in August. That\u2019s higher than the monthly average of 41,133 over the last six months, despite a drop in buy-to-let loans following recent tax changes. UK Finance\u2019s Senior Economist Mohammad Jamei said: \u201cHousing market activity is in Goldilocks territory, growing only modestly since the start of the year, though the mix of activity has shifted towards first-time buyers, away from buy-to-let and cash. We\u2019ve not reached $60 per oil quite yet. Instead, Brent crude price are dipping a little.... European stock markets are subdued this morning, after the US and North Korea escalated their war of words last night. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down around 0.2%, despite a rally among oil producers. North Korea\u2019s claim that the US has \u201cdeclared war\u201d has unnerved some investors, and sent shares down on Wall Street last night. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets say: This has perked up safe haven demand for Gold, bonds, the Yen and Swiss Franc, although relative calm among risk assets suggests many expect the move to again be short-lived. However, the rally in Oil prices is helping buoy sentiment thanks to a Kurdish referendum that could threaten Iraqi exports, extending a summer Oil rebound. Energy trading group Trafigura believes the worst is over for the oil market. Ben Luckock, its co-head of Group Market Risk, told a conference this morning that the era of \u201clower for longer\u201d oil prices would soon be over. Luckock argued that rising demand, and tighter supply, would keep prices up. However...there\u2019s an argument that once prices go up, more supply comes onto the market - particularly from US shale producers. So we shall see.... Yesterday\u2019s Kurdish independence referendum took place without the support of the Iraq\u2019s government in Baghdad. But that didn\u2019t prevent widespread celebrations on the streets of Erbil, capital city of Kurdistan region in Iraq, last night as the polls closed. People chanted \u201cBye bye Iraq! Bye bye Iraq\u201d, set off fireworks and took to the streets in cars festooned with Kurdish flags. There are more than 30 million Kurds, living in Iraq, Syria, Iran and Turkey. So, last night\u2019s referendum has been criticised by Iraq\u2019s neighbours, who fear that their own Kurdish populations will also push harder for their own state. Turkey has a large Kurdish population, and its military forces have been clashing with the militant PKK group, which demands Kurdish autonomy in Turkey, for many years (Ankara insists that the PKK are a terrorist operation, but its leader was recently seen being protected by US soldiers, as his troops fight against ISIS.....) Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan fears that the Kurdish referendum will encourage his own Kurdish population to push for independence. That\u2019s why he\u2019s threatening to take economic, trade and security counter-measures, including possibly shutting the pipeline that runs from Northern Iraq through Turkey to the port of Ceyhan. Erdo\u011fan said yesterday that: \u201cAfter this, let\u2019s see through which channels the northern Iraqi regional government will send its oil, or where it will sell it. We have the tap. The moment we close the tap, then it\u2019s done.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Fercan Yalinkilic has tweeted a handy chart showing how the path of the pipeline: A former Saudi energy ministry official has predicted that the oil price will soon hit $60 per barrel. Ibrahim al-Muhanna told an audience in Washington last night that Opec\u2019s agreement to restrict supplies will keep prices rising. Al-Munhanna, who recently retired as an advisor to the Saudi Energy Ministry, argued: \u201cWith the current arrangement and commitment of major producers, and their willingness to adjust and extend the agreement, I believe as commercial oil stocks continue to contract, oil prices will gradually increase. We even might hit $60 per barrel before the end of this year or the beginning of next year.\u201d Signs that Opec members are enforcing their recent deal to cut production have also helped to drive the oil price up. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, explains: Oil prices have been going higher in recent weeks due first and foremost to evidence that OPEC and Russia\u2019s efforts to reduce the global supply glut was showing positive results and that the group was somewhat surprisingly sticking to their agreement. Indeed, according to the OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, the cartel and its partners had implemented more than 100% of their agreed cuts in August. Talks that the production cuts could be extended has been providing further confidence to oil investors that the rally could be sustained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Motorists face the prospect of higher prices at the pump after the price of oil hit its highest level in over two years. Brent crude has jumped over $59 per barrel, its highest level since July 2015, as concern grows over potential supply problems. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan sparked the rally, after threatening to cut off a pipeline that carries oil from northern Iraq to the outside world. Erdogan is deeply unhappy that the Kurdistan Regional Government held a referendum on independence yesterday, as part of their drive to break away from the rest of Iraq. That pipeline, which runs from Iraq\u2019s oilfields to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, usually pumps between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels per day (Reuters reports), so any disruption could have a significant effect on the market. Oil has already been rising, as US refineries have been hit by the hurricane season - Turkey\u2019s threats have given it another lift, putting Brent crude within sight of the $60 per barrel mark. US crude oil is also up, at $52 per barrel. Central bankers will be watching closely, as energy prices have a significant impact on inflation. A higher oil price could easily drive Britain\u2019s cost of living yet higher, intensifying pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says: The standout trend in markets right now is oil, moving higher pretty steadily.... All of this makes OPEC\u2019s life a little bit easier, but it\u2019s also significant at a wider level. Elsewhere in the markets, traders will be poised for developments following Germany\u2019s general election, as Angela Merkel tries to form a new coalition government. The euro has a bad day yesterday, after the far-right AfD party won seats, as Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever shows: On the corporate side, aerospace firm Bombardier will discover if it will suffer financial penalties over a trade dispute with its rival Boeing. Bombardier is accused of selling its C-Series airliners at artificially low prices. The wings for the plane are made in Northern Ireland, so the US trade court\u2019s initial ruling could affect thousands of jobs. We\u2019ll also be watching out for new housing figures from Britain and America through the day....

But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and other factors. As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. Moving too quickly risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass. A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock.</p> <p>But we should also be wary of moving <em>too</em> gradually. Job gains continue to run well ahead of the longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to overcome without triggering a recession. Persistently easy monetary policy might also eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications for financial stability. For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca858ae4b021792a4faa4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:53:05.334Z\">5.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After last week\u2019s Fed meeting, Yellen admitted the central bank did not really understand why inflation had not returned to target.

But .. many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent.</p> <p>My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation. In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:53:26.191Z\">at 5.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59ca8531e4b021792a4faa48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:50:21.707Z\">5.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yellen\u2019s comments have pushed the US dollar index to its highest level since August 31, as investors bet another rise is coming.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca8469e4b0a816872ae44f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:46:48.235Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yellen\u2019s speech can be seen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/912718067595186176\">here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca831fe4b0a816872ae448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T16:44:58.776Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen hints at further US rate rises</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has hinted at further rate rises, prompting renewed suggestions a December move is on the cards.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s Fed meeting seemed to indicate as much, and in a speech in Ohio Yellen said it would be imprudent to leave rates on hold until inflation reached 2%.

But the oil market has become better balanced over the past year, suggesting that prices should remain fairly stable...</p> <p>There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices. Most significantly, the underlying demand and supply for oil have been coming into balance over the past year or so. There has been a steady increase in demand as global growth has picked up. And the increase in supply has been constrained by the OPEC-led production cuts, for which compliance has continued to be surprisingly good.</p> <p>More recently, leading OPEC members have hinted that they may extend their production cuts of 1.8 million bpd beyond March 2018. This in turn is partly a response to oil stocks not dropping back as rapidly as OPEC members had hoped, due to a surge in oil production by Nigeria, Libya and the US. </p> <p>And prices jumped in the past day or so due to yesterday\u2019s unofficial referendum on independence in the Kurdish region of Iraq and Turkey\u2019s threat to close the pipeline for Kurdish oil exports. Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region produces around 650,000 bpd, the bulk of which goes through Turkey. </p> <p>We suspect that the latest surge in oil prices marks the end of an upward trend. Admittedly, some kind of deal to extend the OPEC cuts is now likely, but it is not a done deal as there are several obstacles to be overcome...And Turkey is unlikely to block Kurdish oil exports unless tensions in the region escalate dramatically. </p> <p>Looking further ahead, it seems likely that oil prices will be fairly stable in the coming years. Not only are global demand and supply now better balanced, but several \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d should take effect. A significant increase in prices would lead to higher shale production and weaker OPEC compliance, and a significant decrease may well prompt OPEC to reinforce its agreement to restrict supply. Our forecast remains for Brent crude to end this year and next at $57pb and $55pb respectively. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59ca5588e4b0ff24dc216345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-26T13:31:31.683Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, the boss of credit reporting agency Equifax is leaving after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/equifax-credit-firm-march-breach-massive-may-hack-customers\">a data breach which exposed personal data of 143m Americans.</a></p> <p>Richard Smith is stepping down as chief executive after 12 years in the top job.

The CMA declined to name the company, but Comparethemarket.com \u2013 made famous by its highly successful meerkat advertising campaign \u2013 said it expected to discuss the issue with the regulator. It also defended its relationships with insurers. The site faces allegations that it has done deals with insurers that prevent them from making cheaper offers on other websites \u2013 known in the trade as most favoured nation clauses.

The good news is that more than 90% of the people we surveyed were very or fairly satisfied with the sites they used. \u201cBut we have also found that improvements are needed to help people get even better deals. We have set out ground rules for how sites should behave, as well as being clear on how regulators can ensure people have a better experience online. We are also taking enforcement action where we suspect the law may have been broken.\u201d News of the further investigation at Comparethemarket.com will be a blow to the brand\u2019s owner BGL, which last month delayed plans for a float that had been expected to value the business at more than \u00a31bn.

A standard box of McVitie\u2019s Jaffa Cakes now contains 10 rather than 12 cakes, while a twin pack has also been put on a diet, dropping from 24 to 20. In a separate assault on snack time, Cadbury has also taken a bite out of the Double Decker and Picnic bars sold in multipacks. These are the latest examples of \u201cshrinkflation\u201d, a phenomenon whereby manufacturers reduce the size of products ranging from chocolate bars to fruit juice and even toilet roll but consumers still pay the same price. Notable examples include Toblerone spacing out its signature triangles and Mars shrinking its sharing bags of Maltesers by 15%. In a statement McVitie\u2019s, which is owned by Turkish group Pladis, said it had reduced the recommended retail price (RRP) of Jaffa Cakes to reflect the smaller packs, adding that \u201cpricing ultimately remains at the sole discretion of retailers\u201d. \u201cThere is no change in the size, shape or weight of individual cakes in the McVitie\u2019s Jaffa Cake range,\u201d it added. The RRP of a single pack of Jaffa Cakes has dropped from \u00a31.15 to 99p, while a twin pack is \u00a31.89 rather than \u00a32.19. However, despite the lower headline price, both still equate to a small increase in price per individual cake. A recent study by the Office for National Statistics found that 2,529 of the products it tracked had decreased in size over the past five years. ONS price collectors always check the size of an item as well as the price when they are gathering information for each month\u2019s inflation figures. Double Deckers and Picnic bars sold in multipacks are now 14% and 21.5% smaller respectively than those sold individually, while the overall pack price is unchanged. Cadbury, part of US food conglomerate Mondel\u0113z, said the move brought the products into line with its other multipacks, which all contain smaller bars than those sold as individual products. Cadbury said rising ingredient costs and the devaluation of sterling since Brexit were making food products more expensive to make. \u201cWe carry these costs within our business for as long as possible to keep our brands as affordable as possible,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cHowever, like all food manufacturers, we sometimes have to make changes to ensure that people can continue to buy their favourite chocolate brands, at affordable prices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of embattled credit agency Equifax announced his retirement on Tuesday, in the wake of a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 143 million people. Richard Smith, 57, retired with immediate effect, becoming the third senior executive to leave since the breach was reported earlier this month. Equifax\u2019s chief information officer and chief security officer have also left the company. In a statement issued by the company, Smith said: \u201cThe cybersecurity incident has affected millions of consumers, and I have been completely dedicated to making this right. At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward.\u201d Smith has been chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 2005. His total compensation was $14.9m in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Equifax is now the subject of multiple state and federal inquiries after the Atlanta-based company said \u201ccriminals\u201d had exploited a US website application to access files between mid-May and July of this year. Consumers\u2019 names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver\u2019s license numbers were exposed. The breach also involved the credit card numbers of about 209,000 US consumers \u2013 the largest credit card hack in US history. The company has also come in for criticism for its confusing response to the hack. A class action lawsuit has been filed against the company accusing it of negligence. The Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs will hold a hearing on the scandal on 4 October and Smith is still expected to testify. The company has been widely criticized for waiting a month before informing clients that its systems had been compromised. Several top executives sold stock totaling $1.7m days before the hack was made public, and the company has lost about a quarter of its value since making the announcement. In a statement, Mark Feidler, a board member who has been appointed chairman, said: \u201cThe board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. \u201cWe are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again. Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize. \u201cWe have formed a special committee of the board to focus on the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "London luxury property prices will stay flat until after Brexit, says Savills", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Prices for luxury homes in central London are forecast to fall 4% this year and will flatline for nearly two more years as Brexit uncertainty and tax changes weigh on the market, according to Savills. The upmarket estate agent is predicting that prices will start to recover towards the end of 2019, rising by 2%, with a stronger bounceback of 8% in 2020. The recovery will take a year longer than the firm previously expected. It blamed heightened political uncertainty, with the \u201ccomplexity of Brexit becoming much more apparent\u201d. Lucian Cook, the head of UK residential research at Savills, said: \u201cUncertainty fuelled by Brexit and a weakened government mandate since the June election means sentiment is fragile.\u201d Prices in central London have fallen by 3.2% in the first nine months of this year, and are 15.2% below their peak three years ago. Sellers are being forced to lower their prices: the number of properties worth \u00a31m or more where the asking price has been cut nearly doubled in the first half of 2017 from a year ago. Savills is forecasting 20% growth in central London luxury house prices over the next five years, which is less than half the 52% long-term average seen between 1979 and 2014. \u201cThat growth is more subdued than what we\u2019ve seen previously coming out of historic downturns,\u201d said Cook. \u201cLondon has pretty much matured. It might lose a few jobs in financial services.\u201d He also pointed to greater exposure to capital gains tax and inheritance tax for overseas buyers, on top of increases in stamp duty. Savills expects the City to lose about 20,000 jobs from its 350,000 workforce in coming years, but believes London will remain a key global financial centre and develop as one of several European hubs for the growing tech sector. Savills estimates there were 394,000 properties worth \u00a31m or more across the UK in 2016, down 3.4% from the year before, although the number has more than doubled in the past decade. Almost two-thirds of those homes are in London and a further 21% in the south-east. In Kensington and Chelsea in west London, almost half of all privately owned homes exceed the \u00a31m mark. Looking beyond the price declines at the top of the market, bloated London property prices have been fuelling an exodus from the capital. The number of people in their 30s who are moving out to the commuter belt or further afield in search of more affordable homes rose 27% in the five years to the end of June 2016, according to official figures. Savills said the most popular locations included Elmbridge, St Albans, Spelthorne, Epsom and Ewell, Oxford and Cambridge, Brighton and Hove, and Bristol and Bath. \u201cHere, the price gap is key, particularly for Londoners looking for more space,\u201d said Cook. \u201cFor example, while \u00a31m will buy just over 1,200 sq ft of home in Wandsworth, it will get you around 2,000 sq ft in Sevenoaks and more than 2,400 sq ft in Bath.\u201d Demand from Londoners fleeing the capital is likely to fuel house price growth in the commuter belt, 30-60 minutes outside the capital, to 15% over the next five years, making it the area with the strongest price growth in the UK apart from central London. Mortgage lending in August hit a one-and-a-half-year high, according to figures from UK Finance, the new trade body for the banking industry. Gross lending rose to \u00a324.2bn, the highest since March 2016 when buy-to-let buyers rushed to complete before a hike on stamp duty, taking lending to \u00a326.3bn. Before that, mortgage lending was last higher in April 2008.",

The US Department of Commerce is expected to announce its decision on Tuesday, after American firm Boeing alleged in April that Bombardier received unfair state subsidies from Canada and the UK, allowing it to sell its C-series passenger jets at below cost in the US. Bombardier has rejected the allegations. Should Boeing win, Montreal-based Bombardier faces a potentially large fine which could put at risk a major order from US airline Delta and the wider C-series programme. Last year Delta made a $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn) order for up to 125 of the jets. The wings for the C-series aircraft are made at Bombardier\u2019s plant in east Belfast, and the UK government and unions are fearful that defeat for the company could put in doubt the future of its Northern Ireland operation. Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-series, and about 4,000 people in total in Northern Ireland. The programme is also crucial to 15 smaller aerospace firms in the region which make components for the wings. This month it emerged that Theresa May had raised concerns about the potential implications for UK jobs of a Boeing victory during a telephone conversation with the US president, Donald Trump. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, accused Boeing of \u201ccorporate bullying\u201d. \u201cWorkers in Belfast are holding their breath,\u201d said Tony Burke, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, speaking at the Labour party conference in Brighton. \u201cThe prime minister and the government need to make it clear to Trump they will not stand back and watch our members\u2019 jobs and our communities threatened like this.

      "bodyText": "Pound jumps on rate hike talk ... Over the past month, sterling has surged to its highest level since the day after the referendum following firm suggestions from the Bank of England that it could raise interest rates from as early as November in order to curb inflation. Although many economists now expect a rate hike in the coming months, some argue the Bank may find it difficult to justify higher borrowing costs amid continuing uncertainty over Brexit. ... pushing the FTSE 100 into decline The surging pound caused the index of Britain\u2019s largest listed companies to record a decline on the previous month \u2013 down 1.6%. Companies on the FTSE 100 make a significant part of their earnings in foreign currencies, so a weak pound boosts their bottom line and thus their stock prices. When sterling rises, the opposite happens. The FTSE 250 list, which has more companies rooted in the UK economy, has fallen by about 1% over the past month compared with August. Worse than forecast Inflation surges ahead Inflation has risen since the Brexit vote as the pound\u2019s sharp drop \u2013 it has fallen 9.5% since 23 June 2016, despite a recent recovery \u2013 makes imports to the UK more expensive. Last month, the squeeze on living standards worsened due to the increased cost of importing fuel, clothes and food, pushing inflation up to 2.9%, from 2.6% in July. The Bank of England now estimates the consumer price index will peak above 3% in October. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, also used a speech in Washington to argue that a sharp reduction in migrant labour to Britain after the EU referendum has the potential to cause a spike in inflation. That\u2019s pushing the rate setters at Threadneedle Street to consider raising interest rates as soon as November. Better than forecast UK\u2019s trade performance worsens outside EU There has been some evidence since the vote of a boost to exports from the weaker pound, raising hopes that a stronger trade performance can offset a downturn in consumer spending. But the latest official trade figures show efforts to expand trade in goods beyond the EU\u2019s borders took a knock in July. Overall, the UK trade deficit for goods and services remained unchanged at \u00a32.9bn between June and July, beating economists\u2019 expectations for it to widen to \u00a33.2bn. Worse than forecast Growth in key services sector sputters Key barometers of companies\u2019 sentiments about business activity were disappointing in August, barring the manufacturing sector, which stands to benefit from the drop in the value of the pound making goods more attractive overseas. The UK\u2019s biggest sector, services, missed expectations amid uncertainty over the Brexit talks, as the Markit/CIPS purchasing mangers\u2019 index (PMI) came in at 53.2 in August, down from 53.8 in July, signalling the slowest pace of business expansion in 11 months. While construction also missed expectations, the August manufacturing PMI beat economists\u2019 forecasts. The PMI measures are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures. Better than forecast Smaller deficit gives Hammond budget boost Britain borrowed just \u00a35.56bn to balance the books last month, the smallest deficit for any August since the financial crisis. That beat City forecasts and was down from \u00a36.9bn a year ago. Higher-than-expected tax receipts gave the public sector finances a bump, which will help the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he prepares for November\u2019s budget. After a strong start to the year for the exchequer, if the pattern remains consistent over the full fiscal year, the deficit over 2017-18 \u2013 the difference between state expenditure and income \u2013 would come in well below the \u00a358.3bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March\u2019s budget. Better than forecast Unemployment lowest since mid-1970s The jobless rate fell to 4.3% from 4.4% in the latest labour market update. This beat economists\u2019 forecasts for no change and represented a 42-year low. Still, wages are not rising as fast as forecast by economists, indicating that tightness in the jobs market is not yet helping workers\u2019 bargaining power to drive up earnings. Analysts said the burgeoning gig economy \u2013 work that offers no guaranteed income \u2013 was behind the rise in jobs, leading to only modest rises in pay. Average earnings rose by 2.1% in the three months to July, although the Office for National Statistics said that left workers suffering a 0.4% cut in real wages when accounting for inflation. There could, however, be wage increases ahead, as Carney, the Bank of England governor, estimates that a sharp fall in EU migrants coming to work in Britain could push up earnings. Better than forecast Consumers keep spending despite soaring prices The squeeze on household budgets is having little impact on consumers\u2019 spending habits, despite prices rising in non-food stores and online at the fastest annual rate since 1992. Growth in retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August after the Office for National Statistics revised the figure for July up to 0.6%, beating expectations for an increase of 0.2%. Even with the jump in prices, non-food and online spending drove the growth in sales last month. The pound rose on the figures, adding weight for a potential rate hike in November. Better than forecast House price growth data mask London decline The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed house price growth improved in August from a month ago, although disguised was a drop in central London prices at the sharpest pace since 2008. A net balance of 6% of surveyors saw house prices increase rather than decrease, up from 1% in July, which was the lowest reading in four years. Sales weakness was largely concentrated in London, the south-east , East Anglia and the north. Meanwhile, healthy sales growth was reported in Northern Ireland, the south-west and Scotland. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... zero-hours contracts are falling The number of people on zero-hours contracts in the UK has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years, as companies appear to be moving away from employing staff without guaranteed working hours. Unions and Labour have raised fears that Brexit could lead to an explosion in insecure work, urging ministers to protect workers\u2019 rights after the UK leaves Europe. The official figures show a fall in the use of contracts that did not guarantee a minimum number of hours to 1.4m in May, down from 1.7m in the same month a year ago, the lowest level since January 2014. Labour said the figure still constituted a \u201cnational scandal\u201d. ONS data for the three months to June also found 883,000 people reported that they were on a zero-hours contract, a fall from 903,000 for the same period a year ago.",

After a strong start to the year for the exchequer, if the pattern remains consistent over the full fiscal year, the deficit over 2017-18 \u2013 the difference between state expenditure and income \u2013 would come in well below the \u00a358.3bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March\u2019s budget.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Unemployment lowest since mid-1970s</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-14T18:44:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Unemployment\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-14T18:44:43/embed.html\">Unemployment</a> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-14T18:49:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Wages\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-14T18:49:41/embed.html\">Wages</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The jobless rate fell to 4.3% from 4.4% in the latest labour market update.

Pathetic growth of 0.5% for the first half of the year wins the UK the wooden spoon. The euro area grew 1.1% and the EU28 by 1.2% over the same period. Germany grew 1.3%; France 1%; Spain 1.7%; Sweden 2.3% and the Netherlands by 2.1%. Even Greece grew by 1%. Among the major EU countries, the UK\u2019s inflation rate of 2.9% compares with 1.5% in the euro area and is only lower than Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Average weekly earnings did not rise at all between June and July. The annual growth of wages fell from 2.8% in June to 1.4% in July. Real wages continue to fall, for the fourth month in a row they were negative, squeezing purchasing power. Debt-fuelled spending can only go on for so long. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3%, its lowest level for 42 years. But underemployment, measured by the number of part-timers who want full-time jobs, rose by 23,000. Currently there are just over a million workers in this category compared with about 670,000 at the start of the \u201cgreat recession\u201d in 2008. Underemployment has replaced unemployment. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for services came in at 53.2 in August, down from 53.8 in July, signalling the slowest pace of business expansion in 11 months. The construction PMI was also weak although August\u2019s manufacturing PMI was strong. The Bank of England agents\u2019 report on business conditions for August was weak. In particular they noted that consumer spending had slowed further, while employment and investment intentions were both modest. Growth looks unlikely to pick up any time soon. On top of all this there was lots of silly talk from several MPC members \u2013 including the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney \u2013 about the possibility of a rate rise later this year. He has done this before and there has never been a rate rise and only a rate cut and more quantitative easing. There is absolutely no basis for a rate rise in the data. The enhanced uncertainty over the form Brexit will take will constrain growth even further. Cut the stupid stuff. Britain is the sick man of Europe. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The economic data over the past month has had a more positive flavour. The unemployment rate has continued to fall, reaching a new post-1970s low of 4.3%. Employment growth has remained resilient despite a slowdown in the rate of increase in spending and economic activity. Retail spending was relatively strong in August, perhaps reflecting the impact of more \u201cstaycations\u201d as the weak pound has pushed up the cost of foreign holidays. Retail sales growth seems to be fluctuating around an annual growth rate of 2% in volume terms. This is much weaker than the growth of about 4.5% seen in the three years of 2014 to 2016. But it is consistent with an economic growth slowdown, rather than something worse. The trade figures show that export volumes were up 9% on a year ago, excluding oil and erratics. This reflects the strength of the world economy and the rebound we are seeing in continental European economies. The trade deficit is not shrinking because import growth has also been strong \u2013 but this too suggests that domestic spending has been increasing, adding to the demand for goods produced overseas. The official figures for manufacturing output have been rather subdued. But business surveys \u2013 from organisations like the CBI and the EEF \u2013 point to healthy growth in industrial production. That is consistent with a picture of rising demand from overseas driving the growth of manufacturing and other export-oriented industries. The public borrowing numbers also provide encouragement for the chancellor and give him some room for manoeuvre in the forthcoming autumn budget. Tax receipts are holding up well, consistent with continuing growth in the UK economy. This more positive flavour to the economic data should encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates in November \u2013 for the first time in more than a decade. This should be seen as a positive development, reflecting the resilience of the economy. A quarter-point rise in the Bank rate would only take it back to the 0.5% level which was set from 2009 to 2016 \u2013 and is most unlikely to derail the economic recovery.",

      "bodyText": "British consumers have been dipping further into their savings amid a squeeze from rising prices and falling real wages, figures show, as growth in personal bank deposits fell to the slowest annual rate since the height of the financial crisis. Annual growth in personal deposits with high street banks fell to 2.2% in August, in the weakest month since May 2009, according to figures published by banking trade body UK Finance. There was also about \u00a31bn withdrawn from cash Isa accounts, with tax changes allowing up to \u00a31,000 of interest to be earned tax free. The trade body said: \u201cIt seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing.\u201d Annual growth in credit card borrowing was at 5% in August, compared with 5.3% the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. UK Finance said that overall the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Although consumer confidence has taken a hit amid rising prices as a result of the weak pound and uncertainty over Brexit, retail sales growth suggests shoppers have not cut back on spending just yet. Growth in retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August after the Office for National Statistics revised the figure for July up to 0.6% There have been fears Britons were increasingly turning to credit cards and loans in order to fuel their shopping habits. However, the falling rate of bank deposits also suggests consumers are dipping into their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available to save fell to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings slipped to 1.7% of disposable income \u2013 a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. A year ago, it was more than three times the current rate. The spending power of British consumers is likely to come further under pressure from inflation, with the Bank of England forecasting the consumer price index (CPI) to peak above 3% in October. The CPI measure of inflation stood at 2.9% in August, driven by the rising cost of importing fuel, clothes and food. Threadneedle Street kept the cost of borrowing on hold this month but said it could raise interest rates for the first time in a decade from as early as November to keep rising inflation in check. Mohammad Jamei, UK Finance\u2019s senior economist, said: \u201cAcross the UK some households have opted to save a little less, whilst others have not increased their borrowing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Noel Edmonds has a major problem with Prof Russel Griggs, the man appointed by Lloyds Banking Group to assess compensation claims for customers caught up in a \u00a3245m fraud. The Deal or No Deal host wants a \u00a3300m payout although Lloyds has set aside only \u00a3100m to cover claims from a total of 67 customers. Edmonds has compared Griggs to the Star Wars villain Jabba the Hutt and questions whether he has the experience to do his job. Indeed, the TV presenter is no longer part of the review process Griggs is running and is expected to go to arbitration instead. Griggs told the Guardian he had not expected such vitriolic personal attacks when he signed up to the job. \u201cI\u2019ve [had] lots of calls from people to say \u2018are you not angry?\u2019. Well I suppose I am,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t really get angry, you\u2019ve got to get on with the job.\u201d Griggs, 69, speaking in the offices of Lloyds\u2019 lawyers in London, said he likes \u201cprocess\u201d. He added: \u201cI suppose I go back to when I was a child, I liked doing jigsaw puzzles. It\u2019s about putting things together and seeing if you can get the picture on the box.\u201d The comparison is apt, because there are stacks of compensation claims piled up behind Griggs in brown boxes as he talks. Nonetheless, it is not surprising that some of the customers whose claims he is assessing are extremely angry. They have waited a decade for recognition that they were mistreated by former HBOS bankersworking out of its Reading branch. The scam involved a former employee of the bank, Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses. Scourfield was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans on to struggling companies and refer them to Mills\u2019s business. Many of the firms went bankrupt and some of the owners lost their homes. The scam took place between 2003 and 2008, before HBOS was rescued by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Mills and Scourfield were among six individuals jailed this year for their roles in the fraud. Edmonds says he has secured the backing of litigation funders, who receive a fee or a percentage of any eventual settlement, to pursue a legal case against Lloyds. Edmonds claims he suffered \u201cimmense economic loss\u201d after becoming a customer of Mark Dobson, who worked for Scourfield at HBOS and was one of the six jailed. The TV presenter, who blames the collapse of his Unique Group business on Dobson, is appearing at an event on Wednesday organised by Nikki Turner, whose business was run into the ground by the fraudsters and who has set up a campaign group. She is among those concerned about whether Griggs will be allowed to make fully independent assessments of claims. Griggs is keen to demonstrate his independence, although not only does the interview takes place in the office of Lloyds\u2019 lawyers, he also conducts it sitting next to Adrian White, chief operating officer of Lloyds\u2019 commercial banking business. Griggs said he is relaxed about White\u2019s presence. \u201cWhile I\u2019m totally independent we have to work together \u2026 or it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Critics of the compensation process Lloyds has set up believe that Griggs merely rubber stamps the offers made to customers, but he rejects that charge, insisting he does not know what offer the bank intends to make. \u201cLloyds go and do their work and then I independently go and look at every case. Then I go and work out what my own outcome is and Lloyds will do the same and then we\u2019ll come together. \u201cIf I disagree with them then I disagree with them \u2013 as I have done on several occasions \u2013 and on those occasions then I usually win,\u201d said Griggs. The biggest area for disagreement appears to be over assessing payouts for \u201cdistress and inconvenience\u201d \u2013 although Lloyds insists its process is more generous than would be obtained through the courts. But progress is painfully slow. The original deadline for offers to be made was June \u2013 which Griggs said he had told Lloyds was a non-starter when it was announced. By the middle of September,the number of accepted offers had risen to 17 with another 14 victims mulling over their offers. White, somewhat pointedly, said the bank has had to pay out \u00a3500,000 in fees to claims management companies representing some of the customers who are yet to provide information to the review. Griggs has also been criticised for not having the usual legal or financial qualifications that someone assessing compensation claims for wrecked businesses might usually have. His personal website is certainly scant on detail \u2013 other than to describe him as \u201cinnovative and creative leader and team player and creator in difficult as well as normal circumstances\u201d. His CV lists an eclectic mix of roles in the pharmaceuticals, flooring and textiles industry, at Scottish Enterprise, and stints in the US. He has, however, had some experience in the banking business, overseeing procedures for branch closures and small businesses appealing against lending decisions. He has an OBE, awarded for services to Scottish industry in December 2008. The academic title dates to 2000 when he was made a professor at Glasgow University to enable him to work on a project bringing multiple campuses together. \u201cThey encouraged me to use the title,\u201d he said. When it appointed Griggs in March this year, Lloyds said he was \u201cselected for his experience in overseeing high-profile reviews of a complex nature\u201d and for his clear understanding of small and medium-sized businesses. So when will he be finished with assessing the claims? Griggs will not say, although he dismisses suggestions he is on a three-year contract worth more than \u00a3250,000 a year. \u201cWe will finish when we finish,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view of this is to get this done as quickly as possible \u2026 but in a way where customers are satisfied with the outcomes. And a lot of this is in their hands.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Cuts to social services and increased tax revenue deliver reduced budget deficit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A multibillion-dollar cut to spending on social services and higher-than-expected tax revenue have helped the government deliver a smaller budget deficit than forecast for 2016-17. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the smaller deficit illustrated the Coalition had been taking a \u201ccautious and wise\u201d approach to the nation\u2019s finances, helping Australia maintain its credit rating. But Labor says the result is more \u201cgood luck than good policy\u201d, with $4bn in extra revenue coming from a better-than-forecast tax take. Treasury officials released the final budget outcome for the 2016-17 budget on Tuesday, showing an underlying cash deficit of $33.2bn for last financial year. The Turnbull government had been expecting a deficit of $37.6bn, so it has welcomed the $4.4bn overestimate. Figures show the budget benefited from higher-than-estimated tax receipts (worth $2bn) and non-tax receipts ($2.1bn) last financial year, and lower-than-expected government payments ($1.2bn), which were also partly offset by higher net Future Fund earnings ($860m). Company tax receipts last year were $590m higher than estimated; GST receipts were $569m higher; receipts from superannuation fund taxes were $488m higher; and excise and duty receipts were $197m higher, among others. But the Coalition has also pursued more than $5bn in cuts to spending on social services since last year\u2019s budget, and has brought government payments down by $1.2bn more than expected. Payments under the National Disability Insurance Scheme were $866m lower that expected last year, due to a more gradual transition of participants into the NDIS than estimated and underutilisation of capital expenditure. Payments across a range of employment services programs were $205m lower, reflecting lower-than-expected demand for wage subsidies and activities supported by the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and the Job Commitment Bonus. Payments under the student payments program were $138m lower, reflecting lower-than-expected number of students receiving income support. Payments for the management of illegal maritime arrivals (IMA) were hundreds of millions of dollars lower, reflecting lower-than-expected costs under the Onshore Compliance and Detention program ($154m) and the IMA Offshore Management program ($102m). The decreases in spending were partially offset by the provision for underspends in the contingency reserve and higher-than-expected payments under the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme ($1.2bn), primarily the result of an increased uptake of medicines. Morrison welcomed the cut in spending on social services, saying it helped the Coalition hold the line on spending. \u201cPayments have come in at 25% of GDP,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThe biggest contributor to what we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the spending side has been a reduction in payments on social services of more than $5bn from when we first announced that position on budget night in 2016. \u201cSince 2013-14, we\u2019ve been holding the line on expenditure. \u201cAt the time of our government\u2019s first [budget] in 2013-14, payments for 2016-17 were estimated to be at $447bn. The final budget outcome is at $439bn for that year now. Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said the government\u2019s \u201cminor\u201d improvement in the budget is more about \u201cgood luck than good policy\u201d. Earlier this month, Morrison claimed there were better days ahead for Australia\u2019s economy after new figures showed an annual growth rate of 1.8%, thanks to a strong pick-up in economic activity in the June quarter. He said the pick-up in growth was consistent with economic developments in the US and Britain, and showed the economy was moving towards \u201cbalanced growth\u201d.",

The final budget outcome is at $439bn for that year now. </p> <p>Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said the government\u2019s \u201cminor\u201d improvement in the budget is more about \u201cgood luck than good policy\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/06/scott-morrison-says-gdp-figures-show-economy-moving-towards-balanced-growth\">Morrison claimed there were better days ahead for Australia\u2019s economy</a> after new figures showed an annual growth rate of 1.8%, thanks to a strong pick-up in economic activity in the June quarter.</p> <p>He said the pick-up in growth was consistent with economic developments in the US and Britain, and showed the economy was moving towards \u201cbalanced growth\u201d.</p>",
