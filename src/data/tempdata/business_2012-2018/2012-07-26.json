A 2006 study, detailed in the Seattle Times, found that in Washington State, 23% of Walmart's 16,000 workers depended on Medicaid or the State's subsidized health plan. Indeed, Walmart's 2012 Walmart Associate Benefits Handbook gives detailed instructions to its employees on how to apply for Medicaid. In addition to the low pay, many workers associated with OUR Walmart have recently complained that the company has begun to demand that workers take on increasingly strenuous workloads, a statement buttressed by a union-backed study which said Walmart has been engaging in company-wide understaffing. Rivaling its massive size is the incredible sophistication of Walmart's union avoidance tactics. Walmart examines prospective employees on their likeliness to participate in organized labor, and closely monitors and conditions employees it hires to snub organizing activity before it starts. The company even has a private jet to convey its mobile union avoidance team anywhere in the country upon detecting nascent organizing efforts. \"Unions for years have tried to unionize Walmart associates, and time and time again our associates have rejected those overtures,\" Fogleman said. \"I think the vast majority of our associates have a very rewarding experience with the company.\"",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has been hit hard by competition to its antipsychotic drug Seroquel, until now one of its bestsellers, from generic drugs as well as lower health spending in Europe. Quarterly sales tumbled 18% in the second quarter, also dragged lower by problems with a new IT system in Sweden which led to supply chain disruptions, and profits crashed 28%. Britain's second biggest drugmaker, which is run by finance chief Simon Lowth until a successor to David Brennan is found, has stepped up deal-making to plug the holes in its pipeline left by the expiry of patents on many of its bestselling medicines. Brennan stepped down in May after an investor revolt, and is getting a payoff of up to \u00a34.6m. Last month AstraZeneca teamed up with its US partner Bristol-Myers Squibb to buy US diabetes specialist Amylin Pharmaceuticals for $7bn (\u00a34.5bn), the largest in a string of recent deals. It came hot on the heels of the group's acquisition of Ardea Biosciences, which has a gout treatment in late-stage development. Lowth said AstraZeneca would continue to \"invest hard\" in new drugs, through partnerships, licensing agreements and purchases of smaller firms. \"We're always actively looking outside for high-quality science, high-quality projects and high-quality product portfolios to bring into AstraZeneca,\" he said. But Seymour Pierce analyst Mike Mitchell was sceptical. He said: \"The absence of a diversified strategy such as GlaxoSmithKline's means AstraZeneca remains significantly more exposed to industry-wide headwinds and \u2026 we are yet to be convinced by AstraZeneca's ability to deliver consistent successes with its M&amp;A-heavy pipeline strategy.\" Revenues at constant exchange rates dropped to $6.7bn between April and June, with the loss of exclusivity on several key brands accounting for 15% of the decline. The heartburn pill Nexium and cholesterol drug Crestor lose US protection in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Reduced spending by governments on medicines, especially in Europe, cost AstraZeneca another $300m. Second-quarter profits before tax sank 28% to $2.2bn. Sales in emerging markets edged up just 1%. China posted 12% growth thanks to strong sales of Crestor, asthma treatment Pulmicort and Seloken, a beta-blocker used to to treat disorders such as high blood pressure and angina. Bigger rival GSK also missed forecasts on Wednesday, reporting an 8% fall in European sales due to government-imposed price cuts, but is over the \"patent cliff\" and has diversified into areas such as vaccines and consumer healthcare. \"So far, AstraZeneca's efforts to replace [key] drugs have been largely disappointing, though the company is pinning its hopes on its diabetes alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb among other things,\" said Ana Nicholls, healthcare analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \"It is also investing heavily in studies to prove that Brilinta, its new blood-thinner, outperforms the current market leader, Plavix. But for the time being, the focus is still on cost-cutting and restructuring, and the benefits of this haven't yet fed through to profits. So far the departure of boss David Brennan in June seems to have made little difference to the gloom surrounding the company.\"",

      "body": "<p>Oil rig maker Lamprell issued its fourth profit warning today as it revealed it expects to make a $45m loss in the first half of the year.</p> <p>The UAE-based firm has been forced to take back its two lifeboats, which are used to help set up offshore wind turbines and offshore rigs, for further checks, having already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/16/lamprell-shares-slump-profit-warning\" title=\"\">admitted previously that the projects were behind because of delays in equipment deliveries</a>.</p> <p>The company also said it would make full year losses of between $12m to $17m. Estimates of a $117m profit were made at the start of the year, along with a healthy bank balance of around $22m.</p> <p>However, the company, which has suffered a whole host of problems because of issues getting the parts it needs, has admitted it will breach its banking covenants, vaguely saying \"Lamprell will be seeking waivers from certain of its banks\".</p> <p>The market is less convinced by its optimism, with shares plunging 43.5p, 35%, at 79p, to a three year low. To put it into context, the company was trading at 336p less than three months ago.</p> <p>And if supply chain issues weren't the only problem the business is facing, two directors, Kevin Isles and Scott Doak, sold a huge swathe of their shares in the company just before the May profit warning, no doubt prompting the FSA to have a close look.</p> <p>Over at Cazenove, analysts note</p> <blockquote> Breach of covenants sounds ominous; in reality this should be manageable. As Lamprell swings to a full year loss it will be in breach of the covenants surrounding its short term debt.

      "bodyText": "Oil rig maker Lamprell issued its fourth profit warning today as it revealed it expects to make a $45m loss in the first half of the year. The UAE-based firm has been forced to take back its two lifeboats, which are used to help set up offshore wind turbines and offshore rigs, for further checks, having already admitted previously that the projects were behind because of delays in equipment deliveries. The company also said it would make full year losses of between $12m to $17m. Estimates of a $117m profit were made at the start of the year, along with a healthy bank balance of around $22m. However, the company, which has suffered a whole host of problems because of issues getting the parts it needs, has admitted it will breach its banking covenants, vaguely saying \"Lamprell will be seeking waivers from certain of its banks\". The market is less convinced by its optimism, with shares plunging 43.5p, 35%, at 79p, to a three year low. To put it into context, the company was trading at 336p less than three months ago. And if supply chain issues weren't the only problem the business is facing, two directors, Kevin Isles and Scott Doak, sold a huge swathe of their shares in the company just before the May profit warning, no doubt prompting the FSA to have a close look. Over at Cazenove, analysts note Breach of covenants sounds ominous; in reality this should be manageable. As Lamprell swings to a full year loss it will be in breach of the covenants surrounding its short term debt.

In an attempt to lure more cost-conscious customers into paying for television, TalkTalk has negotiated a deal with Sky to offer all of its sports channels and Sky Movies on a flexible basis. Unlike most pay-TV packages, customers can subscribe to one channel for a month at a time, rather than having to buy basic channels as a part of the bundle. The YouView box, created in partnership with BT and the public service broadcasters, includes a digital video recorder, an archive of classic British TV shows, a seven-day TV catchup service and a selection of Hollywood films and US television series, such as Lost and Desperate Housewives, to rent on a pay-per-view basis. Stringer, who stepped down as chief executive of Sony in February, said he was \"delighted to be joining the board of such an entrepreneurial and innovative company\".",

      "bodyText": "Profits at British Gas have risen by 23% to \u00a3345m as the return of the bleak British weather hiked household energy bills by \u00a390 in the first half of the year. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, said the \u00a364m increase in operating profit in the six months to the end of June represented a return to normal trading after atypically warm conditions depressed profits last year. Nick Luff, Centrica's finance director, said the improvement in the bottom line had been driven by demand returning to \"normal levels\" among the group's 15.8 million British Gas customers. The profit increase equated to an increase of \u00a390 on the average household bill over the period, to \u00a3614. British Gas has warned of further increases in bills this year, after warning in May that wholesale gas prices were about 15% higher than last year while non-commodity costs \u2013 such as government levies and distribution costs \u2013 could add \u00a350 to bills. Taken together, the cost increases could add \u00a3100 to bills over the next 18 months. Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, said British Gas still faced cost pressures that analysts say will result in further bill increases this winter. \"The cost of gas is still higher for this winter than last winter,\" he said. British Gas, and its rivals, argue that their hands are tied on the issue of bills. British Gas says its average gas bill is dominated by the wholesale cost of the gas, accounting for 56% of the total, with 5% accounted for by profits. Critics of heating prices, from pensioners' groups to MPs and the industry regulator, argue that British Gas is quick to increase bills when wholesale prices increase but slow to reduce them when they fall. Richard Hall, head of energy regulation at Consumer Focus, said: \"Wholesale prices rose a little earlier in the year but are now falling and they are still a long way from their peak in 2008. We have long questioned whether drops in wholesale costs find their way through to household bills.\" The British Gas figures were announced in Centrica's first-half results, which saw a 15% increase in operating profit to \u00a31.45bn. Centrica's two biggest businesses are the \"upstream\" unit \u2013 oil and gas production as well as eight power UK power stations \u2013 and the \"downstream\" operation that provides energy to homes and businesses, where British Gas resides. Aided by three oil and gas field acquisitions in the North Sea for \u00a31.2bn, plus higher wholesale energy prices, the UK upstream business saw operating profits climb by 28% to \u00a3682m. On Wednesday Centrica announced that it is pushing ahead with plans to develop a North Sea gas project with a \u00a31.4bn investment programme that will create 4,000 jobs. The Cygnus project, situated off the coasts of Norfolk and Hartlepool, is a joint venture with the French energy group GDF Suez. The announcement was spurred by the government's decision to award the gas industry a \u00a3500m tax break for shallow water gas fields. Laidlaw added that Centrica's looming decision on whether to invest in British nuclear expansion with France's EdF had not been affected by the outbreak of hostilities between the Treasury and the Department for Energy and Climate Change over green energy subsidies. The nuclear investment decision by British Energy owners EdF and Centrica is heavily dependent on how much financial support the government provides, through underwriting a minimum price for nuclear-powered energy. Asked about the departmental briefing war, Laidlaw said: \"Our perception certainly is that it is not nearly as it has been portrayed in the press.\" On whether British Energy will push ahead with plans to build two new plants at Hinkley Point in Somerset, Laidlaw said: \"There is still a lot of detail to be worked out.\" He added that EdF and Centrica still hoped to make a final decision on nuclear investment by the year end.",

      "bodyText": "Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, has warned that the banking industry is mired in a \"deep crisis of confidence\" as the bailed-out bank took another \u00a3700m hit for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI) and admitted it could get caught up in the Libor rate-fixing scandal. The new provision for PPI mis-selling \u2013 taking the total cost to \u00a34.3bn in 18 months \u2013 drove the bank to a half-year loss of \u00a3439m, down from a loss of \u00a33.3bn in the first half of 2011. The bill is likely to be one of the largest incurred to date for mis-selling financial products. Lloyds, just under 40% owned by the taxpayer, warned it could take six months before there was any clarity in ongoing investigations into Libor, which has resulted in a \u00a3290m fine for Barclays. No individuals had received subpoenas from the authorities, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said, although parts of the bank had and no one had been fired. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took the helm 18 months ago after being recruited from the Spanish bank Santander on an \u00a38m-a-year pay package, called for a cultural change in the industry in the wake of the Libor and PPI controversies. \"The banking sector is clearly facing a deep crisis of confidence and trust. We know, having talked to our customers, that it will only be through an unswerving determination to 'do the right thing' and a fundamental commitment to anchor our business in activities which support the broader economy and contribute to prosperity, which will address and rebuild that trust. This will take time and effort but we have to undertake it,\" he said. A regular critic of the claims management companies that put in claims for PPI mis-selling on behalf of customers, Horta-Os\u00f3rio revealed that the bank had deployed 1,000 staff to tackle erroneous claims. He said 50% of claims submitted by these companies were false, double the level three months ago. Redress payments made and expenses incurred for PPI by the end of June 2012 had reached \u00a33bn. The bank has adopted an approach of \"zero-control risk\" in an effort to stamp out any potential mis-selling and said bonuses would be withheld if staff breached the internal rules. A sweeping review of sales practices has been conducted and bonuses will be reduced this year because of the losses caused by the PPI provisions. The bank intends to accelerate the implementation of the ringfence demanded by the Independent Commission on Banking ahead of than the 2019 deadline stipulated by the government. Sir Win Bischoff, the bank's chairman who intends to step down in the next two years, said: \"I think the market will expect us to have it in place by 2015 or earlier\". Horta-Os\u00f3rio admitted the bank could lose up to \u00a3800m from the sale of 632 branches to the Co-op but that this would be negated by a reduction in capital needed.Creating the branch network, required by the EU as a result of the \u00a320bn of taxpayer money used to prop up the bank during the banking crisis, had cost \u00a31bn. About 45,000 jobs are expected to be lost as a result of the rescue takeover of HBOS in 2008 and a new cost-reduction programme implemented by Horta-Os\u00f3rio when he arrived. In the first half of 2012, 4,555 full-time equivalent role reductions were announced, taking the total to 6,653 since the start of the new cost-reduction programme. The impairment charge of \u00a33.1bn for customers missing loan repayments was down 42% but, on a day when the FTSE rose sharply, Lloyds shares were flat at 29.3p, representing a paper loss of about \u00a311bn on the taxpayers' stake in the bank. The bank's senior management, including Horta-Os\u00f3rio, will be at Friday night's opening ceremony of the Olympics Games because it is major sponsor \u2013 something the bank claims has proved popular with customers.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays was mired in fresh controversy on Wednesday night after handing almost \u00a39m to a top banker who left following the Libor scandal and after one of its highest profile non-executive directors suddenly quit, taking the toll at the top to four. Jerry del Missier, who resigned after telling subordinates to reduce the bank's Libor submission during the October 2008 banking crisis, was reported to have been handed \u00a38.75m cash as part of his leaving package. Alison Carnwath, who also chairs the property company Land Securities, cited \"personal reasons\" and time pressure for her immediate resignation from the board of Barclays, which is still reeling from the exit of chief executive Bob Diamond. The bank's chairman Marcus Agius, who is also in the process of leaving but is due to present the bank's half-year profits on Friday, will now face questions about the pay off for the Canadian-born banker Del Missier, who had just been promoted to chief operating officer. Del Missier was a close lieutenant of Diamond's and appeared before the Treasury select committee to explain why he had instructed the Libor submission to be lowered. Del Missier said Diamond had told him to cut the rate after a conversation with Paul Tucker, the Bank of England deputy governor, something both Diamond and Tucker insist was not the case. Del Missier was one of Barclays' top paid bankers. Although he did not sit on the board, where his pay would need to be published, in 2010 it emerged he had been handed \u00a340m when deals paid out. When reports of a disagreement over Del Missier's leaving bonus emerged, the bank had insisted it was keen to foster debate in the boardroom. Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie called on del Missier to follow Diamond and waive the bulk of his payoff. \"Having resigned from Barclays over the Libor fixing scandal, people will find the scale of this award completely inappropriate. Bob Diamond rightly waived most of his pay off and Mr del Missier ought to do the same,\" Leslie said. Barclays declined to comment. There was speculation of boardroom tensions even before the Libor scandal broke, between Carnwath and Agius during negotiations over Diamond's bonus in the spring. Former investment banker Carnwath wanted Diamond to waive a \u00a32.7m bonus \u2013 part of a \u00a317m pay deal \u2013 to show leadership but she eventually agreed to the payout. At the bank's annual meeting in April the payout sparked a shareholder revolt over the bank's pay policies. Carnwath herself also faced a shareholder rebellion, with 22.5% of investors failing tosupport her because of her status as chairman of the remuneration committee. However, when it later emerged that she had tried to stop the bonus, some investors made it clear they were keen for her to stay. One said: \"She seemed to have been the one board member asking the right questions.\" However, others pointed out that she has eight other jobs or advisory roles in addition to Barclays. They include a non-executive directorship at the troubled hedge fund group Man Group, where she faced another shareholder revolt about her continued membership of the board. She has been on the board of Man for 11 years - which contravenes governance guidelines. Some 33% of investors failed to support her election to the board of Man. At Land Securities her election to the board was not so controversial. Carnwath has not yet commented on the recent events at Barclays, but has spoken to accountancy magazine economia for a cover interview which is to be published on Friday. In the interview she explains that the Barclays remuneration committee faced \"a lot of pressures\" when dealing with the top echelons of the bank. She adds: \"It's not easy, and we don't always get it right.\" \"I sometimes wake up worried \u2013 or don't go to sleep at all because I'm anxious,\" she said. \"That's not so good.

I would like to thank my colleagues on the board for their support and I wish Barclays continuing success in the future.\" Agius, who will leave once his successor is found, thanked her for her contribution since joining the board in August 2010. But her departure comes at a difficult period for the bank which is due to publish first-half profits of around \u00a33.7bn on Friday. The board has now handed a central role to former top accountant Sir Michael Rake, who becomes deputy chairman \u2013 although he has ruled himself out of the chairman's job despite expressing interest when Agius first quit. The ongoing turmoil at Barclays came as the US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner pinned the blame on the UK for the Libor problem. At the time he was head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and made proposals to the UK about how to solve problems with the rate, which is overseen by the lobby group the British Bankers' Association. \"We felt, and I still believe this, that it was really going to be on them,\" he said.",
