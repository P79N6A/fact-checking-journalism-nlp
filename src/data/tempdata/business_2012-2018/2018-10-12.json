      "bodyText": "Phew! After some rocky days, the New York stock market has ended the day higher. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed 287 points higher at 25,339, a gain of 1.15%. The wider S&amp;P 500 has risen by 1.4%, while the Nasdaq jumped by 2.3%. A sense of calm seems to have returned to the markets, with investors suspecting that this week\u2019s losses have created some bargains As Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management, puts it: \u201cGenerally what we were seeing is more momentum and technology names selling off. Now buyers are coming back to say some of these are babies that were thrown out with the bath water. \u201cNow we\u2019ve had the pullback, valuations look attractive. But lets not forget what a bad few days it\u2019s been. The three main US stock indices have all suffered their worst week since March, with the Dow shedding 4.2%, the S&amp;P losing 4.1% and the Nasdaq off 3.7%. Opinion is split over whether it\u2019s merely a healthy correction, or the start of a major sell-off. Given Europe managed to fall again today, there may be more drama ahead. We\u2019ll get a better feeling next week. Until then, goodnight! GW With less than 10 minutes to go, Wall Street is on track to end firmly higher. Traders on the floor of Wall Street look a little cheerier today, as they watched shares rise rather than slide... Wall Street traders are licking their wounds tonight after a bruising few days, which has knocked 5% off the Dow. That sharp decline, after a series of record highs of late, is making some investors reassess the health of the markets. But did the fall go too far? Some analysts are predicting better times ahead, at least in the short term. As Marketwatch puts it: Late-Thursday stock trading was characterized by powerful gyrations amounting to hundreds of points that took place within minutes. The Journal reported the Dow tumbled about 240 points in the final 90 minutes of trade, representing about half of Thursday\u2019s losses. However, some technical analysts make the case that the market has reached an oversold condition, where further declines may not be justified. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly expecting a bounce in the short term,\u201d wrote Justin Waltes, co-founder of research firm Bespoke Investment Group, in a Thursday report. However, he warned that \u201cit\u2019s the longer term that we\u2019re more concerned about now given the technical breakdown we\u2019ve seen. Expect a rally soon, but don\u2019t go loading up on cyclicals with the expectation that the pain is over once we bounce. There is likely more volatility to come in the weeks ahead.\u201d Back in the UK, the chairman of cake and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has dipped, deep, into his pocket to keep it afloat. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson (whose future columns for the Sunday Times are eagerly awaited) is putting \u00a320m into the company, as a loan. This follows the alleged \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d revealed this week that has left the business\u2019s future in serious doubt. At least two of its shops closed today, and finance director Chris Martin was arrested. Technology, consumer goods and basic materials companies are all pushing the Dow higher today. Credit card firm Visa is the top riser, up 3.6%, followed by Walgreen Boots (+3%), then three tech firms - Cisco, Microsoft and Apple all up around 2%. But energy firms Chevron and Exxon are lagging, down over 1% each. That\u2019s because the number of US oil rigs has jumped, according to new figures today, suggesting suppliers are trying to boost output. Wall Street is still managing to rally, though. Just. The Dow is currently up 90 points, or 0.37%, on track for its first gain after six days of losses. Tech stocks are recovering, pushing the Nasdaq up by 109 points or 1.5%. European stock markets have suffered their worst week in eight months. After jumping in early trading, shares dipped through the afternoon as traders became edgier again. Most indices have ended the day in the red, again, meaning the Stoxx 600 index of top European companies has lost 4.8% this week. That\u2019s the worst weekly performance sine February, when it lost 5.1%. Reuters says: There\u2019s \u201ca rotten trend\u201d in Europe, a trader complained, noting that U.S. shares have outperformed their European peers since the beginning of the year with the Trump administration\u2019s fiscal cuts boosting earnings. Europe lags far behind the United States in terms of earnings growth, and stronger results will be critical in luring back some of the billions that have been pulled out of European stocks this year. The rally in London\u001f has petered out. The FTSE 100 has closed 11 points lower at 6995.91, a dip of 0.16%. That takes it to a new six-month low, and deeper into a correction. Still, it\u2019s a rather smaller loss than on in recent days. The European stock market rally is running out of steam! After a strong start, the major indices are heading back to earth as the closing bell approaches. The FTSE 100 is now up only 9 points, or 0.1%. Germany and France are also subsiding. David Madden of CMC Markets thinks traders are keen to protect themselves from any more volatility on Wall Street tonight (where stocks are still higher) The equity markets got off to a strong start following a mixed session in Asia, but now the gains are evaporating as we approach the close. Traders are keen to square up their books ahead of the weekend. The global equity rout originated in the US, and the moves continue to be US driven, and European dealers are keen to cash in their holdings as Wall Street still has several hours more trading left. The pound has lost ground today, as traders continue to watch Brexit developments nervously. The UK government is currently trying to reassure sceptical MPs, and ministers, over a proposed backstop arrangement that could effectively keep the whole UK inside the customs union. Downing Street insists that it would never agree to an \u2018indefinite\u2019 backstop, in an attempt to placate Brexit-supporting MPs who insist on a clean break with the EU. But with time running out, the pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.318. Ursula Johnston, head of customs, Gowling WLG, warns that such an arrangement may not would actually deliver frictionless trade. That\u2019s a crucial issue, as the government begins work on turning motorways in Kent into parking lots for lorries after Brexit... She explains: The UK newspapers are filled today with reports of Theresa May closing in on a deal with the EU whereby the whole of the UK would remain in \u201ca\u201d, or, \u201cthe\u201d customs union with the EU for an indefinite period. This is on the face of it promising news for those that would like the UK to keep the closest possible trading ties with the EU without being a member of the Single Market. The concept of a UK \u2013 EU customs union seems to offer the holy grail of frictionless trade and providing a workable solution to the Irish border conundrum. However what has not been clarified, as yet, is whether the UK would remain part of the Customs Union and trade with the EU-27 as it does today i.e. no customs administrative requirements or whether the UK will form a new customs union with the EU. Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits. Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u2019s plans: The guidance published today is pure fantasy. The government say that they will \u201cseek to bring into force bilateral UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible thereafter\u201d. There is no mention that the UK is currently unable to negotiate bilateral deals, so there is absolutely no possibility of bilateral agreements being in place on exit day. Worse still \u2018as soon as possible thereafter\u2019 will be the time it takes to negotiate deals \u2013 this is at least 5 years if not longer. That\u2019s at least 5 years in which UK businesses will face increased costs for customs clearance and compliance. Today\u2019s guidance on free trade agreements is telling. It grossly underestimates the time it takes to negotiate free trade deals, and glibly notes that \u2018there may be practical changes\u2019 to how current users of EU free trade agreements will deal with third countries. Importantly, however, the government has dropped its fantastical stance of simply rolling over EU free trade agreements on exit day. The problem is that there is no viable option to avoid increased tariffs or other impediments to trade in a no deal scenario. Ding Ding! The opening bell of Wall Street is ringing out, setting us up for a strong open. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 1.5%, or over 360 points. That follows two days of big losses that wiped out almost 1,400 points. The S&amp;P 500 is also up around 1.5%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is rallying hard too, up almost 2.5%. After six days of losses, New York is trying to end this week on the front foot. Financial stocks are among the top risers, after decent results from JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo earlier today. Stephen Mnuchin has also played down the suggestion that China could dump its holdings of US government debt. He claimed such a move would be costly for Beijing, and that there\u2019d be plenty of other buyers anyway. More soothing words, this time from US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin. Asked about the markets, Mnuchin told CNBC that \u201cmarkets tend to go too far in both directions\u201d - suggesting he\u2019s not too worried about this week\u2019s losses. Mnuchin also insisted that the US economy was in good shape. arguing: \u201cThe fundamentals are still very strong. \u201cThe U.S. economy is strong. U.S. earnings are strong. I see this as just a natural correction after the markets were up a lot.\u201d Unlike his boss, Mnuchin didn\u2019t blame the Federal Reserve for the sell-off. Asked about Trump\u2019s criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, Mnuchin replied: I think Jay is doing a good job. Maybe all is forgiven, now shares are are going up again.... Financial titan JP Morgan has given the markets a boost, by releasing stronger financial results than expected. JP Morgan earned $2.34 per share in the last quarter, beating forecasts of $2.25 per share. Revenues were 5% higher too, at $27.8bn, suggesting Wall Street is managing to navigate the choppy waters of 2018. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, says: \u201cJPMorgan Chase delivered strong results this quarter with top-line growth in each of our businesses, demonstrating the power of our platform. The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy.\u201d Wall Street traders have woken up in a better mood .... Stock markets in emerging economies are recovering some ground today, after suffering their biggest fall in two years on Thursday. The MSCI index of developing market stocks has jumped by 2.2% today, led by Taiwan (up 2.4%), India (+2.1%), the Philippines (+1.75%) and South Korea (+1.5%). Here\u2019s Reuters take: Those moves tracked a general improvement in appetite for risk among investors globally, with developed world stock markets recovering after a dramatic two-day slide on Wall Street. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a bit of a rebound in EM stock markets today...we saw a similar occurrence earlier this year when U.S.stocks came under pressure and that automatically improved, and that might be what we\u2019re seeing this time around as well,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. US tech stocks may have a better day too... Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in four hours. Dow futures are showing a 350 point gain, which would claw back a chunk of yesterday\u2019s 545-point losses. Fiona Cincotta of City Index thinks the worst is over, for now anyway.... The global selloff seems to have come to an end and the market is picking up the pieces after the hurricane. The tally: the Dow has lost 1,400 points in two days, Brent Crude is back down at $81 and the dollar is trading at 1.1579 against the euro. Key indices have fallen below their 200-day moving averages and are beginning to look oversold but the underlying economic reasons for a rise in interest rates that had triggered the spike in bond yields and the selloff in equities is still in place. For the moment though, European markets are back in the black and the recovery in Dow futures indicates a stronger start on Wall Street later today. Investors should be wary before diving back into the market today, argues Peter Dixon of Commerzbank. He writes: The sharp correction in stock markets in the last couple of days should be seen as a warning shot against the market complacency which has been one of the predominant themes of the last 12 months. Indeed, measures of equity volatility continue to suggest that investors are underpricing risk. We pointed out at the start of the year that equity investors appeared to be increasingly reluctant bulls and were driven more by the FOMO factor (fear of missing out) than the fundamentals, and advised investors to take risk off the table. Dixon points out that shares still look pricy, even though the Footsie has shed almost 10% since the start of the year. Having enjoyed a great run since March 2009, with global equities having generated returns of 300%, it is difficult to imagine that there is much more juice to be squeezed out of the lemon. On a conventional valuation basis, long-term P/E ratios suggest that equities are extremely expensive. The cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) popularised by Robert Shiller suggests that the S&amp;P500 has only once been more overvalued than it is today \u2013 the late-1990s tech boom \u2013 on a dataset going back 130 years: Despite today\u2019s recovery, stock markets are heading for their worst week since February, Reuters points out. The markets are breathing a sigh of relief this morning, says Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor. But while some investors are piling back into shares, others are being more cautious. Trade wars, rising interest rates and slowing growth have been front and centre in terms of big macro reasons for the rout, but the reality is that investors need to be asking whether valuations can be justified by company profits or have markets got ahead of themselves? The start of the US earnings season sees JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank all reporting today, and good results could provide the catalyst that sees markets recover their recent losses, while disappointing numbers are likely to jeopardise any positive sentiment. Newsflash: stricken UK cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has told the City that its finance chief was arrested last night. This follows the discovery earlier this week of a \u00a320m black hole in the company\u2019s balance, sheet, and \u201caccounting irregularities\u201d. The company told shareholders that: The Company has been made aware that Chris Marsh, who is currently suspended from his role as Company Finance Director, was arrested by the police last night and has been released on bail. Further updates will be released in due course as appropriate. Yesterday, Patisserie Valerie warned that it needs \u201can immediate injection of capital\u201d to survive. It also revealed earlier this week that it faces a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than \u00a31m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm\u2019s directors had been unaware of. In another sign of easing tensions, the Vix volatility index has dropped this morning. The VIX is now hovering at 21.74% this morning, down from Thursday\u2019s eight-month high of 25% yesterday. Reports that the leaders of US and China could hold fresh talks over trade next month are also helping the markets shake off their losses. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: The Washington Post reported Trump and Xi agreeing to a side-lines meet at next month\u2019s G20 summit, fuelling hopes for a trade war truce to offset rising bond yields mounting pressure on the US economy. Global markets have calmed down overnight, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. His morning note to clients is titled \u201cA day off for the horsemen of the apocalypse?\u201d, suggesting he expects less drama today... European trading is underway, and markets are bouncing back from yesterday\u2019s slumps. The FTSE 100 is sitting up in bed and taking some soup. The blue-chip index has gained 30 points at the open, or 0.4%, taking it back to 7035. However, that still means it has suffered a correction (down more than 10% since May). The German market is looking perkier too - the Dax has gained 1.2% at the open. France is up 1%, while Spain is 0.9% higher. Confidence may be returning to the markets, after some panicky moments earlier this week. But is it a proper recovery, or just a classic \u2018dead cat bounce\u2019? Neil Wilson of Markets.com sees reasons for optimism: The breadth and depth of the decline in the US market is a concern and suggest earnings and valuations are a factor. In addition to the yield narrative, in many ways this selloff could reflect real angst about the third-quarter earnings season and what outlook is painted by corporates on earnings calls. ... However, on the fundamentals the reasons to be positive remain in place. The fact that the US inflationary pressures are not running out of control continue to suggest this is a picture of good news and fundamental strength. It\u2019s been a cheerier end to the week in Asia. China\u2019s benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, has jumped by 1% - a recent performance, until you remember it slumped by 5% on Thursday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index is 2% higher, while Japan and Australia have stabilised. Stephen Innes of trading group OANDA reckons traders need the weekend to recuperate, after some draining days: This market is exhausted from all after the most significant sell-off in global equities since February. Its large shake out the landscape remains no less uncertain and while the current narrative is likely to rage on until Novembers G20 summit at least, prudence suggesting keeping one\u2019s powder dry on this recovering Friday and live to fight another day after yesterday most unpleasant experiences. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of heavy losses, the financial markets are catching their breath and assessing the situation today. Asian markets have rallied a little overnight, and traders are predicting a bounce-back in Europe this morning too. But there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety in the City today, after investors watched the FTSE 100 lurch down by 2% into a correction yesterday. That set up Wall Street for another big slump last night; the Dow lost another 545 points, taking its two-day losses to over 1,300 points, or 5%. Anxiety over US interest rates, the trade war between America and China, and signs that the world economy is slowing are all being blamed. Plus, Donald Trump is adding to the uncertainty by firing a series of pot-shots at the Federal Reserve, who he blames for fuelling the sell-off. Here\u2019s yesterday\u2019s liveblog, covering all the drama from Europe, to the US and then Asia: David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says investors remain nervous..... while also wondering if this week\u2019s turmoil is actually a buying opportunity. It was a choppy day yesterday as traders remained cautious about the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, mounting political pressure in Italy, and deteriorating global trading relationships. We saw huge swings in European and US stock markets as traders were battling with the age old emotions of fear and greed. Traders love to snap up relatively cheap stocks, but sharp moves to the downside have left some traders worried this could be the beginning of a major decline. Stocks in Europe and the US finished the day firmly in the red. On the economic front, we get a new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s factories today, plus a new measure of US confidence. Plus it\u2019s the start of the bank reporting season, with Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo all reporting results. That could well move the markets....

This is on the face of it promising news for those that would like the UK to keep the closest possible trading ties with the EU without being a member of the Single Market. The concept of a UK \u2013 EU customs union seems to offer the holy grail of frictionless trade and providing a workable solution to the Irish border conundrum. </p> <p>However what has not been clarified, as yet, is whether the UK would remain part of the Customs Union and trade with the EU-27 as it does today i.e. no customs administrative requirements or whether the UK will form a new customs union with the EU. Should the UK and EU agree on a new customs union arrangement with the EU this will eliminate tariffs but does not mean no customs administration and paperwork. There will highly likely still be a requirement to file a declaration that the goods are in UK or EU free circulation and provide a customs value and classification for those goods. This is not frictionless trade as some would no doubt envisage. It offers a trading arrangement for customs purposes that is closer to a free trade agreement without delivering any of the wider benefits.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/11/second-kent-motorway-is-possible-post-brexit-lorry-park\">Kent motorway to shut as work begins on possible post-Brexit lorry park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade and competition law, Gowling WLG, is more scathing about the government\u2019s plans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The guidance published today is pure fantasy.

Worse still \u2018as soon as possible thereafter\u2019 will be the time it takes to negotiate deals \u2013 this is at least 5 years if not longer. That\u2019s at least 5 years in which UK businesses will face increased costs for customs clearance and compliance. </p> <p> Today\u2019s guidance on free trade agreements is telling. It grossly underestimates the time it takes to negotiate free trade deals, and glibly notes that \u2018there may be practical changes\u2019 to how current users of EU free trade agreements will deal with third countries. Importantly, however, the government has dropped its fantastical stance of simply rolling over EU free trade agreements on exit day. The problem is that there is no viable option to avoid increased tariffs or other impediments to trade in a no deal scenario.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T14:27:24.433Z\">at 3.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5bc0a8dbe4b05798be94c236\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T13:59:59.072Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/1050741015609581568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Stocks open sharply higher on Wall Street following a two-day rout; Dow industrials jump almost 400 points.</p>&mdash; The Associated Press (@AP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/1050741015609581568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5bc0a23ee4b02837e97b0f84\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-10-12T13:39:15.925Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street rebounds</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ding Ding!

      "bodyText": "Aid charities and trade unions have denounced a World Bank report that advises some of the poorest countries in the world to accept the demands of multinational corporations to hire and fire workers and remove laws protecting workers\u2019 rights. Oxfam said the report\u2019s main message was that governments should abandon labour market regulation and rely instead on low levels of welfare to prevent workers falling into extreme poverty. With poor countries facing the twin threats from large corporates unwilling to negotiate with trade unions and young start-ups insisting on casual labour arrangements, Oxfam said the World Bank appeared to offer labour market deregulation as the only way to prepare countries for the changing nature of work. The International Trade Union Confederation also expressed alarm, saying that the World Bank, which provides development loans to struggling nations, was guilty of accepting as benign the sweeping changes brought in by new technologies, in its latest World Development Report (WDR). It also accused the World Bank of selectively choosing a small group of countries and household income figures from favourable years to illustrate falling levels of inequality. \u201cOne particularly striking assertion near the beginning of the report is the dismissal of any concern about growing income inequality. It does this by claiming that in 37 of 41 developing and emerging economies Gini coefficients, which measure inequality, either decreased or remained \u2018unchanged\u2019 between 2007 and 2015. Besides the limited number of countries in the sample, the choice of the WDR to retain only eight years of data \u2013 starting with the beginning of the global financial crisis \u2013 is highly selective,\u201d it said. Launched at its annual meeting in Bali, the World Bank\u2019s annual policy statement is widely regarded as setting the tone for anti-poverty projects across the developing world. A draft of the report published earlier this year was widely criticised for proposing lower minimum wages alongside greater hiring and firing powers for employers. Proposals to cut minimum wage levels have been dropped, but broader deregulation policies remain a key theme of the report, critics said. The bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said he was urging governments to increase spending on social protection, health and to clamp down on tax evasion. \u201cThe report challenges governments to take better care of their citizens, calling for a universal guaranteed minimum level of social protection. Full social inclusion will be costly, but it can be achieved with reforms in labour market regulation in some countries and, globally, a long overdue overhaul of taxation policy,\u201d he said. Oxfam said the emphasis on social protection put the costs of supporting workers and poor households on the government, letting employers off the hook. \u201cThe WDR casts serious doubts over the commitment of the World Bank to reducing the gap between rich and poor,\u201d it said. \u201cIts core recommendation, the need to water down the rights of workers for the greater good of the economy, was discredited may years ago. It is completely at odds with the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, both of which are saying that we need more trade unions and higher minimum wages to counteract the growing power of extreme wealth in the world.\u201d The World Bank has suffered a turbulent year following the exit of its chief economist, Paul Romer, who quit after accusing his department of manipulating figures to support the bank\u2019s policies.",

      "bodyText": "The multi-millionaire chairman of Patisserie Valerie is pumping \u00a320m of his own cash into the stricken cake and cafe chain to keep it in business after \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d was uncovered that left the business teetering on the brink. Details of the proposed emergency rescue plan came hours after it emerged that the finance director of Patisserie Holdings, which has over 200 cafes and nearly 3,000 staff, had been arrested at his home by police. Chris Marsh, who joined the company in 2006, was arrested on Thursday night and has been bailed. Hertfordshire police, who declined to name the individual, said a 44-year-old man from St Albans, where Marsh lives, had been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. The Serious Fraud Office confirmed it has opened a criminal investigation into an individual but said it could give no further information. On Friday afternoon, Patisserie Holdings said it needed at least \u00a320m in new cash to avoid calling in administrators. It revealed that historical statements about its finances \u201cwere mis-stated and subject to fraudulent activity and accounting irregularities\u201d. The company said an initial investigation into its accounts showed that instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as it last reported, Patisserie Holdings is nearly \u00a310m in debt. It said annual underlying profits \u201ccould be\u201d \u00a312m in the year to 19 September compared with \u00a326m reported last year. The stock exchange-listed business \u2013 which was valued at \u00a3450m only four days ago \u2013 has raised \u00a315m from its shareholders by issuing new shares. To keep the company trading until the paperwork is done, chairman Luke Johnson, an entrepreneur who owns 37% of Patisserie Holdings, is stumping up \u00a320m in loans. Half will be interest free and the cafe chain has three years to pay it back. Half will be repaid when the share placings have been completed. Patisserie Holdings said the new funds would be used to pay immediate debts \u2013 including money owed to HMRC and suppliers. It said it hoped to agree a \u201cstandstill\u201d deal with lenders, so they take no action to recover other money owed for 12 months. The statement warned that previous financial statements were likely to have been wrong and if it uncovers \u201cany further findings of financial irregularity\u201d there could be more and bigger losses. Marsh was suspended on Tuesday night after the cafe and cake chain revealed \u201csignificant and potentially fraudulent\u201d accounting irregularities. Accountants from PwC are carrying out a forensic examination of the group\u2019s accounts as it tries to accurately assess the scale of the accounting black hole. Shares in the company remain suspended. One employee told the Guardian that staff had been asked to pay for deliveries with cash from the tills on Friday as they worried about getting paid. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a big facade that everything is hunky dory and if you ask questions you are immediately shut down. The only thing we have been told is not to talk to customers or journalists. There\u2019s a lot of European staff and they are the most vulnerable because it is not being explained to them.\u201d At least two London stores had closed on Friday after action by landlords. A sign in the window of the Hammersmith outlet said the lease had been forfeited because of non-payment of rents. Other landlords told the Guardian that they had been paid in September and an adviser to property owners said its clients were \u201cwaiting and seeing\u201d rather than taking aggressive action. The accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, said it was \u201clooking into this matter carefully and will give full consideration to further action as more facts become available\u201d. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is also expected to examine the case. The company\u2019s directors have admitted its main trading subsidiary faces a winding-up petition from HMRC over a \u00a31m unpaid tax bill. The petition was filed on 14 September but the directors were unaware of its existence until earlier this week. It is expected to be heard in court on 31 October. Marsh sold share options in July, generating a \u00a3700,000 profit.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sky\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, has been handed a near-\u00a340m bonanza following Comcast\u2019s \u00a330bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster. The windfall will see Darroch pay a monster tax bill estimated to be about \u00a314m \u2013 which is more than the total UK tax paid by Amazon (\u00a34.5m), Facebook (\u00a37.4m) and Netflix (received a \u00a3174,000 rebate) combined last year. The bidding war between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox powered a near-doubling of Sky\u2019s stock market value in the last year, fuelling the bumper pay day for Darroch and the finance chief, Andrew Griffith. Sky said that Darroch, who has run Sky since December 2007, has now received about \u00a337m for his shares. Griffith has received about \u00a317m. Comcast\u2019s takeover of Sky includes buying out the personal stakes and various investment and share schemes that Darroch and Griffith have with the company. Darroch is in line to receive several million more when his annual pay and bonus awards for running the company over the last year are revealed. The 55-year old received \u00a316m in total remuneration for running the company for the year to the end of June 2017. However, his pay for Sky\u2019s most recent financial year will be substantially lower as the company\u2019s bumper long-term incentive plan payouts only vest every two years. Comcast has bought out Darroch\u2019s personal Sky stake, 775,772 shares, worth over \u00a313m at the \u00a317.28 price it acquired the company. The US pay-TV giant has also bought more than 1.4m of Darroch\u2019s shares tied up in various schemes including Sky\u2019s long-term incentive plan and co-investment plan. More than 13,000 Sky staff across Europe who are part of Sky\u2019s Sharesave scheme will also share the windfall. Historically, scheme members were able to buy shares at prices between \u00a36.08 to \u00a38.17 and will make gains equal to the the value of the difference between that price and \u00a317.28. The scale of the staff windfall is not known. Sky\u2019s share price skyrocketed after Murdoch\u2019s Fox submitted a \u00a310.75p a share bid in December 2016. At the time of Fox\u2019s opportunistic bid, Sky was trading at \u00a37.69p. Darroch has overseen a trebling of the value of Sky since he took over as chief executive at the end of 2007, when it traded at about \u00a36. As chief executive he has overseen a massive expansion of the business. In 2014, he spent almost \u00a37bn buying its sister companies in Germany and Italy creating a pan-European pay-TV giant with more than \u00a312bn in revenues and 23 million customers. Darroch is yet to reveal what his future plans are but Comcast is likely to want him to stay on board for at least a couple of years to help transition the business. His service contract states that he, or Sky, have to give up to a year\u2019s notice, if he decides to leave. There is also a one-year non-compete clause. His contract states that \u201cthe company may require the individual to continue to fulfil current duties or may assign garden leave\u201d, if he resigns.",

      "bodyText": "The hairdressing group Regis, the owner of Supercuts, is asking landlords for free rent at more than 20 stores as part of a rescue plan. The group has asked for rent reductions of 25-100% at 110 of its 220 salons. Regis warned that if the plan is not approved by creditors then it was likelyit would enter administration. The request is part of an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement, being handled by the advisory firm Grant Thornton, which Regis said would allow it to invest to drive growth. Jackie Lang, the managing director of Regis UK, said: \u201cThis action has been taken to restructure our costs to ultimately enable reinvestment into the business to improve our digital platforms and our expertise in-salon. If successful, over 90% of our creditors will be unaffected.\u201d Creditors will vote on the deal on 26 October and 75% must vote in favour for the restructure to go ahead. The CVA is the latest of a string of similar cost-cutting plans in the struggling retail sector that have led to hundreds of store closures across UK high streets and shopping centres this year. Carpetright, Mothercare and New Look have used CVAs to get rid of unwanted stores, while Toys R Us and House of Fraser tried CVAs before going into administration. Eddie Williams, the head of restructuring at Grant Thornton\u2019s Birmingham office, who is working on the deal, said: \u201cAs part of this, there are no planned salon closures, and as such no employee redundancies are planned, which is a positive in the context of the challenges the high street has seen over the last 12 months and which continue to be prevalent.\u201d Grant Thornton said the British Property Federation, representing landlords, had been consulted about the proposal. But one landlord told the Guardian: \u201cThere has been no warning at all. They suddenly stopped paying their rent and within days a CVA document arrived.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At King\u2019s Cross station in London, one of Europe\u2019s busiest transport hubs, the workers at Pret a Manger never stop. Calls for lattes and flat whites ring out, sandwiches are placed in paper bags and bank cards are held to payment screens every few seconds, all day, every day. The crisis that has engulfed the company in recent weeks seems hardly to have made a dent in this busy outlet, but across the UK the picture is more nuanced. From being the fresh-faced darling of high street convenience food, Pret has found itself in the unfamiliar and deeply unwelcome position of being the food industry\u2019s bogeyman. First it emerged that 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse had died after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich bought at Heathrow in July 2016. Days after the coroner had told the company he feared others might die if it did not change its processes, scandal hit again. It emerged that a second customer, 42-year-old Celia Marsh, had died last December after eating a super-veg rainbow flatbread containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free but was not. While the impact may not be immediately evident at its outlets, many customers have been left feeling betrayed. \u201cI\u2019ll never go in another Pret as long as I live,\u201d says David Collins, whose daughter has the same sesame allergy Natasha had. \u201cWhen I was working in London, I would go every other day, like everyone does. But for me they have let down their customers.\u201d Further stories about Pret\u2019s \u201cfreshly baked bread\u201d being imported part-baked and frozen from France and tales of a vegetarian customer finding sausages in their breakfast pot have left the UK\u2019s favourite cafe chain reeling, says Adam Leyland, editor of the Grocer. \u201cI think the longer it goes on, the more Pret has been found to be on the back foot,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom a crisis management point of view they are not handling it well and it isn\u2019t getting better.\u201d The company\u2019s response to the crisis has been criticised from an emotional and practical standpoint for being slow out of the blocks. Natasha\u2019s parents called a handwritten note received from Pret\u2019s chief executive, Clive Schlee, in August \u2013 more than a year after their daughter\u2019s death, and a week before an inquest began \u2013 \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. The company was criticised again after focusing blame for the death of Marsh on the vegan yoghurt company CoYo, which it said provided a product contaminated with dairy protein. CoYo has said Pret\u2019s claims are unfounded. \u201cThey have taken corrective action far later than they should have done, then when further stories have emerged they haven\u2019t covered themselves in glory,\u201d says Leyland. \u201cThere is a lot of love for the Pret brand, and I don\u2019t think that can be evaporated overnight, but what these tragic cases have done is exposed slack procedures and the weaknesses in their business model and processes.\u201d Those processes were laid bare during the inquest into Natasha\u2019s death. It focused on the fact that while the company listed allergy warnings around shops, the packaging on individual products did not list allergen advice. This was not illegal; under regulation 5 of the food information regulations, shops are not required to fully label food produced in kitchens on site. But it was strange, the acting senior coroner S\u00e9an Cummings said, that a vast chain of food outlets that sold 218m products a year would be bound by the same rules as an independent sandwich shop. Only after the coroner ruled that allergens were not \u201clabelled adequately or clearly\u201d on Pret packaging, and suggested that the company had been \u201cevading the spirit of the legislation\u201d, did Pret introduce full labelling on its products. During the inquest it had argued there was a \u201cmislabelling\u201d risk if it were to introduce such measures. Pret has cultivated an image as a rustic local store selling healthy products. \u201cThe perception of the business is created by their marketing \u2013 the free coffees, the veggie outlets, this homespun idea \u2013 but people should think about what they are buying,\u201d says Mark Borkowski, a PR expert. In April this year the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said Pret\u2019s promise that it made \u201cproper sandwiches avoiding \u2026 obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives\u201d and \u201cgood, natural food\u201d were misleading because some of its foods contained E numbers. In May, the company was sold by its British private equity owners, Bridgepoint, to JAB Holdings, the owners of Krispy Kreme, with workers being told they would receive a \u00a31,000 payment if they were on staff during the week the deal was completed. Started by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe and his university friend Sinclair Beecham in 1986, a third of the business was sold to McDonald\u2019s in 2001 then bought by Bridgepoint in 2008. The company is skating on thin ice, says Borkowski. \u201cI think there is a sea change going on, you cannot promote yourself as one thing and be another. This is a serious dent for Pret, it\u2019s not going to overturn the brand overnight but it can\u2019t carry on projecting this image without living up up to it.\u201d Andy Slaughter, the Labour MP for Hammersmith, where the Ednan-Laperouse family live, says the company responded poorly. \u201cThey do need to step up to the plate, but the reality is they are not going to and they have said as much putting the focus on government action.\u201d He argues that to make a real difference the government needs to change the law and enforce legislation, but he has little confidence it will do either. \u201cGovernment is saying it\u2019s down to businesses and businesses are saying it\u2019s down to the government, while both are relying on enforcement from local government organisations that have been cut to the bone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a piecemeal regulatory framework, with no real resources to actually enforce it.\u201d Schlee has spoken of the company\u2019s regret at the deaths and said it would \u201clearn from this tragedy and ensure meaningful changes happen\u201d. \u201cI hope these measures set us on course to drive change in the industry so people with allergies are as protected and informed as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is more important to Pret right now.\u201d The deaths have left those with allergies uncertain about which food outlets they can trust. \u201cI have spent a lot of time in the last few weeks talking to anxious parents and anxious children,\u201d says Dr Nicola Brathwaite, a consultant paediatric allergist at King\u2019s College hospital in London. \u201cWe tell patients to always read product information and always ask \u2026 Sometimes things go wrong even when you do ask but each check is one more step to keeping people safe.\u201d Many will stop taking that risk, says Collins, who feels that a lack of care and attention in many shops and restaurants means that even with intense supervision and utmost care, his daughter is always in danger. \u201cPeople think you are being fussy, but the difference between an allergy and an intolerance is critical,\u201d he says. \u201cAn allergy is life or death and people have to understand that if you are serving food to someone with an allergy you better be sure what\u2019s in it \u2013 because if you are not it can kill them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "RBS has paid its first dividend since it was rescued from collapse by a \u00a345.5bn taxpayer-funded bailout 10 years ago. The bank said the dividend, announced in August, was worth about \u00a3240m to 190,000 shareholders, including the state vehicle UK Government Investments, which holds the taxpayers\u2019 62% stake. The Treasury will pick up nearly \u00a3150m. The chief executive, Ross McEwan, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased to be able to pay a dividend to our shareholders; a small return after their many years of patience and a testament to the hard work of everyone at this bank. This is another important milestone in our turnaround, almost 10 years to the day that RBS was rescued by the British taxpayer. \u201cWe have created a smaller, safer bank that is generating more sustainable profits. Our capital position is above our target and we are also looking to return any excess capital as soon as possible to shareholders.\u201d RBS became a symbol of the UK banking sector\u2019s implosion during the financial crisis that engulfed the world in 2008, with public ire focusing on its aggressive expansion under the former chief executive Fred \u201cThe Shred\u201d Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood. Despite Friday\u2019s dividend windfall to the Treasury, the government is still sitting on a huge loss on its investment, part of a bailout orchestrated by the then prime minister, Gordon Brown. This year the RBS chair, Sir Howard Davies, said it was unlikely the bailout cost would be recouped in full, given the extent to which the bank had shrunk since its bailout, largely as a condition attached to the receipt of state aid. The government has begun selling chunks of shares in the bank, reducing its holding from more than 80% to 62% but at well below the 502p-a-share price at which it originally bought the stake. Last November, the government said it aimed to sell \u00a315bn of RBS shares by 2023, offloading \u00a33bn a year over five years. One stake was sold in June at 271p a share; a 5.4% stake was sold in 2015 at 330p a share. As RBS resumed its dividend, the Positive Money campaign group delivered a birthday card to RBS, admonishing the bank for its \u201cfailure to change\u201d in the decade since its bailout. Campaigners handed over the card at a branch of RBS in Angel, north London, as it opened at 9.15am on Friday. It bears the message: \u201c10 years since the global financial crash, happy anniversary\u201d on the front. Inside, it reads: \u201cTen years on and none the wiser!

    "webTitle": "$100 a barrel? Will Iran sanctions and Venezuela crisis bring oil price spike?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unthinkable just a few years ago, oil could soon hit $100 a barrel. The reasons are manifold. Looming Iranian sanctions in November, supply problems in the US and less spare capacity from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) all have some crude-oil market participants betting that black gold prices may head to $100 \u2013 a price unseen since 2014. \u201cThere\u2019s really no margin for error in the global markets right now; markets appear to be undersupplied \u2026 We don\u2019t have a big glut of oil any more,\u201d said Rob Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at energy-investment firm Tortoise. As recently as 2016, Opec overproduction and rising US shale output created an oil glut, pushing the global benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude-oil prices to under $30. Increased global demand and normalized production levels have caused prices to rise to their current levels of about $84 for Brent and $74 for WTI, the highest in nearly four years. Oil prices slipped hard this week as stock markets fell and figures showed larger stock piles of oil in the US than expected but traders are increasingly betting that the only way is up for oil prices. According to data from the CME Group, in the last week the number of trades speculating on $100 a barrel rose to a record 31,000. As of Wednesday, the current number of open positions is slightly under that record level. An option is a right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a certain price. Much of the pressure on oil prices comes from Washington. In May, Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions, prohibiting Opec\u2019s third-largest member from selling crude oil. Those sanctions go into effect on 4 November. Thummel says up to 2m barrels a day of Iranian crude oil may be off the market, which comes at a time when other Opec members like Venezuela are producing a fraction of what they can pump. Saudi Arabia is also limited with how much extra it can supply, as it is probably near the top of its capacity. Energy fund manager Emil van Essen, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Emil van Essen, said no one thought the US would put as much pressure on Iran as it has. \u201cIt is removing a ton of barrels and there really is not enough to make up for it,\u201d he said. A potential row with Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi could also spill over into oil, although analysts say there are no signs of that yet. The US is also having its own logistical and economic problems, Daniel Ghali, commodity analyst at TD Securities, and Thummel said. Pipeline constraints in the US\u2019s top shale-oil field, Texas\u2019s Permian basin, limit how much oil can leave the region. Because of the bottleneck, companies drilling there get about $15 a barrel less for their Permian oil versus the WTI benchmark, which means they are not benefitting from the price run-up, Thummel said. If there is another global supply disruption, \u201c$100 a barrel is not out of the question\u201d, Ghali said. Jason Bloom, global macro exchange-traded fund strategist for Invesco, and a 15-year oil market veteran, agreed a spike to $100 is possible, but a move higher would only be temporary, saying that the current supply and demand situation doesn\u2019t merit $100. Van Essen said he doesn\u2019t see $100 oil happening this year, but said supply shortages next year will be critical because of IMO 2020, new global shipping rules that go into effect on 1 January 2020, forcing ships to reduce fuel emissions by using low-sulfur fuel or installing scrubbers to remove the sulfur. \u201cIt requires the oil refiners to use lower-sulfur light sweet crude [to make the fuel] and there\u2019s just not enough to go around,\u201d he said. With oil prices at four-year highs, some global leaders have asked producers to kick in more oil. On Wednesday, the head of the International Energy Agency urged Opec and other major oil producers to open the spigots to prevent high prices from damaging the global economy. And of course Trump\u2019s Twitter trigger fingers are notorious for blaming Opec for high oil prices, despite forcing Iranian oil off the market because of US sanctions. As recently as September, Trump tweeted for Opec to lower prices. Bloom said whenever there is active trading in options prices that are far away from current values, it can signal that traders have a feeling the price swings may become more prevalent, and they hope to capture some of that volatile movement. \u201cGeopolitics are certainly building in that direction. When you see major governmental institutions pleading for more crude oil on the market, it\u2019s not a great sign,\u201d Bloom said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "President Donald Trump has blamed an \u201cout of control\u201d Federal Reserve for sharp drops on global stock exchanges and said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the central bank\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell. Global stock markets fell again on Thursday as investors worried about signs of slowing growth, rising trade tensions and higher interest rates. However, Asian stocks staged a fightback on Friday, stemming Thursday\u2019s bloodletting. Shares were up in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng index climbing 1.18% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi index up 1.35%. Yet shares were down in Tokyo (0.12%) and Sydney (0.12%). The benchmark Shanghai Composite, which fell by as much as 6% on Thursday, was flat on Friday, while the Shenzhen Composite, an index tracking stocks on China\u2019s second exchange, was down 0.32%. In a sign of possible state intervention, the state-run Securities Times sought to soothe jittery investors by calling for more market-friendly policies from the government in Beijing. Authorities \u201cshould roll out positive measures so that investors know the government cares about the stock market, while listed companies and financial institutions should also contribute to improving market confidence\u201d, it said. China reported higher than expected export growth on Friday, adding to a trade surplus with the US, which could worsen an ongoing trade war between the two countries. Chinese exports in dollar terms rose 14.5% in September, compared with a year earlier. China\u2019s trade surplus with the US reached a record high of $34.13bn in September, up from $31.05bn the month before, according to Chinese customs data. In Thursday\u2019s US trade, all the major stock markets closed down after similar drops on Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500, the market benchmark, closed over 2% lower, its sixth straight daily decline. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday\u2019s 830-point tumble. The falls came as London\u2019s FTSE 100 index lost close to 2% and in Europe markets ended the day at a 21-month low. That followed sharp corrections across Asia with losses in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea. US investors are suffering their biggest losses since February which have escalated tensions between Trump and Powell. Powell, who took the Fed\u2019s top job in February, has presided over a series of interest rate rises which have attracted Trump\u2019s criticism. Trump has been a persistent critic of the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy. On Thursday, he renewed his criticism, blaming the recent downturn in the stock market on the Fed\u2019s rate policy. \u201cWe have interest rates going up at a clip that\u2019s much faster than certainly a lot of people, including myself, would have anticipated. I think the Fed is out of control,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump said he had no intention of firing Powell. Asked if he might dismiss the Fed chair, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to fire him. I\u2019m just disappointed.\u201d Part of the recent rout in US stocks has been down to sharp falls in the so-called Faang companies \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. The tech giants\u2019 share prices have soared in recent months \u2013 Apple and Amazon became the first two companies ever to be valued at more than $1tn. Both have suffered sharp losses in recent days as investors have cashed in gains. Amazon dropped another 3.4% on Thursday and Apple fell another 1.4%. But the falls are now spreading beyond technology stocks. US crude oil dropped 3% to $70.97 a barrel in New York and energy stocks fell sharply too. The price of gold \u2013 a haven for investors \u2013 rose 2.9% to $1,223.50 and ounce. \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 is looking very weak and negative and that is putting fear into investors,\u201d Michael Matousek, head trader at US Global Investors told Reuters. \u201cWith the markets going down people are increasing their allocation towards gold.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of FTSE 100 company directors from ethnic minority backgrounds has declined in the past year, according to a progress report delivered by the government-backed campaign to boost boardroom diversity. Just 84 of the 1,048 director positions in the 100 biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange are held by a business leader from an ethnic minority, down from 85 last year, in the latest sign of stalling progress to make big companies more representative of the country at large. The figures were compiled for the first annual update on the Parker review, which last year set a target for the FTSE 100 to appoint at least one board-level director from an ethnic minority background by 2021. Progress has gone into reverse, however, suggesting time is running out for companies to hit the voluntary target and that more action must be taken. The majority of FTSE 100 boardrooms still have no ethnic diversity at all. Fifty-four of the 100 firms do not have a single board director from an ethnic minority background, up from 51 a year ago. Overall, 8% of the directors of top firms are from ethnic minorities, but UK citizens from such backgrounds account for just 2% of roles, despite making up 14% of the population. Sir John Parker, the chairman of the mining company Anglo American, who conducted the review, said he was braced for only limited progress in the first year, but warned companies they now needed to take action. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make real progress. The purpose of this update is really to alert again, and to make business leaders even more conscious they need to step up,\u201d he said. The figures come a day after Theresa May unveiled plans that could force big employers to reveal their race pay gap statistics, in an extension of the rules obliging companies to publish their pay gaps between men and women. The government has come under growing pressure to reform corporate governance rules amid growing distrust of big business, stoked in the decade since the financial crisis by rising inequality, the imposition of austerity, and several corporate scandals such as the collapse of Carillion. May\u2019s reform agenda has, however, faced sharp criticism from Labour, which has called for a far more radical overhaul of corporate Britain, including putting workers on boards and forcing the transfer of company shares to workers. Although FTSE 100 boards are still predominantly pale and male \u2013 with more chairmen called John than women \u2013 there are some exceptions. Land Securities and Hargreaves Lansdown are among the few firms with a female chair, while bosses from ethnic minority backgrounds include the Diageo chief executive, Ivan Menezes, the Barclays finance director, Tushar Morzaria, and Shriti Vadera, who sits on the board at BHP Billiton and is chair of Santander UK. The Parker review followed similar pushes to boost the representation of women on boards, including a review by the former Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies in 2011 and the more recent Hampton-Alexander review. There has been progress to increase the number of women on boards, although this also appeared to stall earlier this year when a study from Cranfield University revealed a sharp drop in the number of women holding top corporate jobs. Despite concerns over the lack of progress, businesses continue to warn against using government-enforced quotas, similar to those used in some other countries. Parker said: \u201cA voluntary target is worth 10 quotas. I\u2019m against them and I don\u2019t think that professional people want to be there because there is a quota. \u201cI do believe that companies will take this seriously. It\u2019s very much in companies\u2019 business interest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asian stock markets are fighting back against the tide of selling seen in Wall Street again overnight. It\u2019s a mixed picture in financial markets but the main points are: Tokyo (0.44%) and Sydney (o.o5%) are down. Seoul (1.1%) and Hong Kong (o.5%) are up, and Shanghai is flat. In currencies, the US dollar index is down slightly at 94.97. The Aussie dollar is up a bit in the past few hours at US71.21 while the yen is holding steady against the dollar. The pound is up at $1.323. The FTSE100 is seen opening up 0.1% while the Dax in Frankfurt will rise 0.6%, according to futures trade. Chinese exports grew 6.5% for the year so far, showing decent growth despite trade tensions. But the China customs agency warned that growth may slow in the fourth quarter Chinese media hints at state intervention to stem possible losses In Australia, mortgage lending was down 2.1% in August \u2013 more ethan the market expected and bad news for super-leveraged local housing industry Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank said the country is at risk from some external shocks such as a US-China trade war or a slowdown in China. Catch up with our market wrap here: Or check out Richard Partington\u2019s excellent explainer about why stocks are going down (or is that up?): And with that I\u2019m wrapping up this blog. The inestimable Graeme Wearden will be back at 7am UK time. Thanks for joining me. And more still from China. The Shanghai Composite, which fell by as much as 6% on Thursday, was flat but in a sign of possible state intervention, the state-run Securities Times sought to soothe jittery investors by calling for more market-friendly policies from the government in Beijing. Courtesy of Reuters... Authorities \u201cshould roll out positive measures so that investors know the government cares about the stock market, while listed companies and financial institutions should also contribute to improving market confidence,\u201d the media said State-owned Global Times said in an editorial that China\u2019s stock market \u201chas a limited impact on the whole Chinese economy, and the Chinese economy has withstood this round of impacts.\u201d \u201cWhat will happen to the US stock market and how it affects the US economy remain to be seen,\u201d the Global Times editorial said. More on China. The country\u2019s customs agency says foreign trade grow may slow in the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year. But reuters reports that spokesman Li Kuiwen says exporters are diversifying their markets, which will support overall export growth. The reflects a very strong start to 2018 \u2013 and a trade surplus of 1.44 trillion yuan (US$208.72 billion). But because it\u2019s only the first three quarters we don\u2019t know the full picture of how the trade tensions have impacted. Still with China, and the Shanghai market is exactly flat, while Hong Kong is up 0.5%. The Nikkei is off 0.44% and Sydney is just in the red by 0.05%. And in case you\u2019re wondering what all this is about, you\u2019re in good company ... the US economist Paul Krugman doesn\u2019t have a clue either. Some reaction to the Australian housing market numbers, which are quite bad. Less lending = lower house prices as one tweeter neatly up sums. But at least the number of first-time buyers is the highest for six years. The bank hearings have wound up in Canberra. In final questions, ANZ chief Shayne Elliott said fewer customers used physical banks to do their business and so ANZ plans on closing about 12 of its 650 or so branches. That follows a trend, Elliott says, which had been set over the last couple of years, with 30 to 50 branches being closed a year. Elliott now heads to his meetings with bank customers who have come to Canberra to discuss their issues with him. Next Friday, Andrew Thorburn, the head of NAB, will face the committee. The positive moves in the Chinese markets come despite the Singapore central bank announcing a tightening of monetary policy. It\u2019s a sign of the times. Singapore, which manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, noted that it expected steady growth despite the possibility of trade tensions disrupting the global outlook. Monetary Authority of Singapore said: In 2019, trade frictions between some major economies and the uncertainty they pose could weigh more discernibly on global economic activity. Barring a significant setback in global growth, the Singapore economy should expand at a pace close to potential in 2019. The Chinese markets have opened up. Hong Kong has managed a gain of 0.5% while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.16%. As far as Australia is concerned, the RBA says the economy is at risk from external shocks and says the incipient US-China trade war or a slowdown in growth in China could trigger a domestic problem. Australia would be sensitive to a sharp contraction in global growth or dislocation in global financial markets because of the importance of trade and capital inflows. A worsening in external conditions could see a downturn in the domestic economy, reduced availability and higher cost of offshore funding and falls in asset prices, with a resulting deterioration in the performance of borrowers and lenders. As for the housing market, it says it has turned a little and says it could be \u201ca positive development for financial stability\u201d However, it could also be bad news for people who have borrowed too much and find themselves in negative equity as lending requirements tighten and house prices fall. Some existing borrowers may find they do not meet new lending standards and so have difficulty refinancing. Similarly, while most borrowers with loans transitioning from interest-only to principal and interest payments are well placed to meet the higher payments, a small share could struggle. The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued its financial stability review today. It says the rise in US interest rates blamed for the current market volatility are not causing much disruption. But it says that some risks are emerging as the Fed moves away from the low-interest environment: The extended period of low-interest rates has seen some financial stability risks emerge. Notably compensation for risk is very low with asset prices in a range of markets at high levels, underpinned by low long-term interest rates. Household, corporate and sovereign debt has also risen to high levels in some jurisdictions. For emerging market economies \u2013 especially those with structural or cyclical vulnerabilities \u2013 there are concerns about the implications of a tightening in financial conditions in the advanced economies. Those housing finance figures are not great news for Australia\u2019s banks, which have built their huge profitability in recent years on some heroic mortgage lending. The financial sector of the ASX 200 is down 0.77% today in a market off 0.25% overall. Things go from bad to worse in the Australian housing market. Figures just released by the bureau of statistics show that total dwelling finance dropped by 2.1% in August to just over $30bn \u2013 much worse than the -1% expected and a big drop on the 0.4% increase in July. Another big fall in investor lending. It\u2019s down -1.2%. On the currency markets, the yen has continued to hold up against the dollar at 112 to the greenback. A stronger yen is usually not so good for the Nikkei, which is a stronghold of Japan\u2019s big exporters. The Aussie dollar \u2013 a key proxy for emrging markets in the Asia Pacific region \u2013 has also fought back during the big stock selloff, going from around US70.5 to US71.27 this morning. The Nikkei has dropped a modest amount this morning. We\u2019re currently off by 0.22%, or 50 points, at 22,541 points. The Kospi in Seoul is up 0.47%. Sydney is now down only 0.15%. Elliott also admits that ANZ\u2019s profits have been hit by the aftermath of the commission, explaining that the bank\u2019s return on equity has fallen from 17-18% to 11% in the past few years. \u201cANZ\u2019s profitability is dramatically lower than it was,\u201d he says. Labor MP Matt Keogh has scored a direct hit against ANZ boss Shayne Elliott bringing applause from the audience in Canberra, which includes people from the Bank Reform Now group. It came after the bank boss seemed to suggest that money being paid out as compensation to customers belonged to investors (\u201cit\u2019s their money\u201d he said). But Keogh said: \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 it should have been in the customer\u2019s pocket the whole time,\u201d to which Elliott puts his hands up: \u201cI accept that I misspoke there, fair point. The bulk of the money is not refunds actually, the bulk of the money is actually the cost of going back and finding and recalculating the money and doing the data search - that was the piece I was talking about, the cost of remediation, the work, costs significant amounts of money, that is what I was referring to \u2013 but you are quite right, the refund money obviously belongs to customers.\u201d In commodities, gold has benefited from falling stocks as investors seek familiar safe havens for their money. Business Insider tells us that on Thursday gold had its best day since Brexit. Talking of Brexit, just a quick diversion here which readers might find depressing or amusing, or perhaps a bit of both. The UK transport department has announced that part of the M26 motorway in Kent will be closed while work is carried out on figuring out how to turn it into a truck park in the event of Brexit causing huge delays at the Channel ports and tunnel. You couldn\u2019t make it up, as they say. More from Amy in Canberra. Shayne Elliott says he has met some ANZ customers who felt abused by the bank, and was personally answering emails from customers. He also gives his personal email to the committee and asks people to contact him directly with their concerns. It\u2019s Shayne.Elliott@anz.com The committee members, including Liberal MP Trevor Evans, are giving personal cases to Elliott and asking about those customers who still say they are not receiving responses from the bank. \u201cEvery case is unique and they should expect a response,\u201d Elliott said, who is appearing before the committee for the fourth time. \u201cI give my commitment that I will be personally involved in the response from the bank.\u201d He says he won\u2019t always be the person who speaks directly with the customer, but he makes the commitment that he \u201cwill stay on top\u201d of responding to customer\u2019s concerns. But he also says, in terms of time frames, some of the matters are exceptionally complicated, mentioning one case which goes back to 1992. But he\u2019s meeting with more customers this afternoon - including the case Evans just raised. ANZ chief Shayne Elliott is getting his grilling from a parliamentary committee. My colleague in Canberra, Amy Remeikis is watching and says that Elliott has told the committee that renumeration had absolutely been part of the ANZ culture - which follows on from Commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u2019s interim report which found \u201cgreed\u201d had led to a lot of the misconduct issues. Elliott said there had been changes, and he admits, again, that he was wrong to have dismissed the need for a royal commission, \u201cgiven what has been uncovered so far.\u201d ANZ has engaged in misconduct and conduct falling below community standards and expectations. It is completely unacceptable that we have caused financial harm and emotional distress to our customers. He also said there was \u201cno pride\u201d being the subject of regulator Asic\u2019sfocus and that it caused reputational damage and was seen as a \u201cmajor fail\u201d. He said \u201cfear\u201d was a \u201cstrong word\u201d when it came to Asic, but the bank \u201ccertainly respects Asic\u201d. Overall, he wants you to know that the bank has changed. \u201cThe bank needs to be able to generate capital so we can fulfil our social obligations, but we need to get that balance right and we clearly failed at that in the past, and we are moving away from that. As I said, revenue, and the generic terms for \u2018sales\u2019 hasn\u2019t been part of the group score card in the last three years, so we don\u2019t have that same middle layer, saying \u2018middle management have a sales target, but the juniors don\u2019t. We don\u2019t have that today. But we can certainly improve and I agree that we need to do more work in getting that balance right. Not a bad start for the ASX after yesterday\u2019s big moves. Losses are easing back already but it\u2019s early days. Volatility could be the name of the game today. Jonathen Chan, market analyst, CMC Markets, thinks so, and flags today\u2019s data (see below) as key set points:. Futures markets are pointing to a mixed start for Asia Pacific equities. Regional markets may fluctuate in a similar fashion to the overnight action in the US markets. In particular, the Australia housing finance data due this morning may influence the banking sectors, as well the appearance of senior executives at the royal commission inquiry. The Shanghai stock markets may have a chance to rebound if the trade balance data due this afternoon illustrates growth, or potentially lesser impact from the trade war. We\u2019re off. The ASX 200 has slipped 47 points or 0.8% at the open. I should say that the Australian stock market opens in Sydney at 10am local time (00.00BST) followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour later. Then at 02.30GMT trading starts in Hong Kong and Shanghai. And in Australia this morning it is the turn of ANZ bank boss Shayne Elliott to face questioning by MPs in the wake of the damaging revelations of the banking royal commission. The inquiry has exposed a widespread culture of greed in an industry once revered for having avoided the worst ravages of the global financial crisis. Matt Comyn, the boss of the country\u2019s biggest bank Commonwealth, was jeered from the public gallery during his apperance yesterday. If you\u2019re reading outside Australia and you haven\u2019t followed the course of the commission, here is an excellent wrap of the preliminary findings. Aside from what happens on the markets, there is a lot of data being released today which will keep us busy. At 11.30 Sydney time (01.30BST) we have Australian mortgage lending figures for August which will speak to the state of the housing market. In July they were up 0.4% but the market forecast is -1%. The Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s financial stability review comes at the same time which could contain commentary on the markets. We\u2019re also expecting China trade data later which could shed some light on the state of the Chinese economy. When Europe awakes, we will get industrial production figures for the eurozone. One of the biggest talking points of the past 24 hours has been Donald Trump\u2019s comments about the Federal Reserve and interest rate hikes. The president has described the Fed as \u201cout of control\u201d because he thinks it is increasing borrowing costs too quickly and putting pressure on the economy. Greg McKenna, the independent Australian market strategist, has this salient point: President Trump has captured the narrative by blaming the Fed for all these market ructions. But the reality is the economy his policies have overheated does need more rate hikes. Markets know that he knows that, but the Fed is the perfect foil in the run-up to the mid-terms. The New Zealand stock market is up and running. A bit like how they are among the very the first to celebrate New Year, the Kiwis are first out of the blocks for finance. The benchmark NZX-50 index is currently down about 1% after dropping 3.64% yesterday. Remarkably, it\u2019s still positive for the year, unlike most others. If you need a more in-depth catch up on a dramatic day\u2019s trading on Wall Street, you can read the wrap by my colleague Dominic Rushe here. Good morning to everyone in Australia and Asia, and good evening to everyone else. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019m taking over the blogging reins from the the indefatigable Graeme Wearden. The news from here is that more falls are expected in markets across the region, but so far not as dramatic as yesterday. The ASX in Sydney is seen falling 1.1% with around the same mark expected for the Nikkei in Tokyo. But who knows where they might end up if the dramatic swings in the Dow Jones today are anything to go by. What we do know for sure is that the Aussie dollar has had a good crisis. Like Usman Khawaja, it is has risen to task and climbed nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to stand at US71.2c. A quick recap Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses, as the global stock market correction continues. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 2.1%, or 545 points, on top of Wednesday\u2019s 830-point tumble. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices also weakened sharply again. The sell-off followed a bruising session in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slumped by almost 2% into a correction, down 10% since its peak, while European stocks languished at a 21-month low. Italy lurched into a bear market. Earlier, Asia-Pacific markets suffered sharp losses too, with China down over 5% and Japan losing almost 4%. Traders fear fresh losses on Friday, with Australia called down another 1.1%. Economists have blamed a series of factors for the selloff, from trade war angst to rising US government borrowing costs. Neil Wilson of Markets.com argued there are five key factors: Rising bond yields \u2013 the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u2019s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u2013 the breadth of the decline \u2013 we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u2013 we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u2013 the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season A deepening row between the White House and the US Federal Reserve is also looming over the markets. Donald Trump has unleashed a series of attacks on the Fed, blaming its interest rate policy for spooking the markets. On Thursday Trump said he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 in Fed chair Jay Powell, but insisted he didn\u2019t intend to fire him, Apprentice-style. The president explained that the strong dollar was driving shares down: It\u2019s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u2013 and it causes difficulty doing business. IMF chief Christine Lagarde rode to Powell\u2019s defence, insisting that the Fed was doing a good job. But still, Trump\u2019s claim that the central bank is making a mistake has raised the pressure building on the Fed. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Martin Farrer who will cover developments in the Asia Pacific markets. Markets will be opening in Australia in less than three hours, followed by Tokyo and Seoul an hour after that. Traders throughout the region are braced for another rough ride. Some $50bn was wiped off values in Australia on Thursday as the benchmark ASX 200 plunged 2.74%, its worst day since February. It is set to fall 1.1% at the opening on Friday, according to futures trading. Donald Trump\u2019s attack(s) on Fed chair Jay Powell make the front of Friday\u2019s Financial Times: US and European stock markets have been a veritable sea of electronic ink today, following the overnight rout in Asia. Here\u2019s the damage...... Phew! Traders in New York can finally catch their breath, after another rough day. And there\u2019s nothing to celebrate -- instead, we\u2019re staring at big losses for the second day running. The Dow has closed down 2.1%, or 545 points lower, at 25,052, on top of Wednesday\u2019s 830-point slide. The S&amp;P 500 provisionally closed 2.06% lower, while the Nasdaq lost around 1.2%. Unless something remarkable happens in the last 10 minutes, Wall Street is going to end the day deep in the red. The Dow is having another wobble, now down 485 points at 25,119 Another twist! The Washington Post is now reporting that President Trump will meet with President Xi at the G20 meeting of world leaders next month. This is lifting Wall Street off its lows, on hopes that relations between Washington and Beijing might be melting. Things have been worse, though... The S&amp;P 500 index has had a bad day too, currently down almost 2% as market volatility spikes. Some photos from in and around Wall Street today: Here\u2019s our news story about the market mayhem: The City has felt the full impact of a sell-off in global financial markets with shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading companies now more than 10% below their record peak in May. On a second day of turbulence, aftershocks from panic-selling on Wall Street rippled through Asian and European bourses as dealers took fright at trade tensions, the prospect of higher inflation and Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to put pressure on America\u2019s central bank over interest rates. The FTSE 100 \u2013 the index of UK blue-chip shares \u2013 closed almost 2% lower after dropping 138.81 points to 7006.93. After a closing peak of 7877 in late May, the FTSE has now lost more than 10% of its value \u2013 the definition of a market correction. Boom! The Nasdaq has tallen into correction territory, a journey which Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 travelled a few hours ago. The tech-focused index has shed 2% today, or 151 points, to 6,892. That meaning it has lost more than 10% since its record high of 7,700 at the start of this month! Nearly every one of the 30 companies which make up the Dow has lost ground today. Pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, fast food chain McDonalds, and energy companies Chevron and Exxon are among the big fallers. Make that 500 points off the Dow! The sell-off is accelerating as we head towards the final hour of trading. Oh dear, the Dow is taking another leg downwards in afternoon trading. It\u2019s now shed 424 points, or 1.66%, 25,174 points. That means the Dow has lost more than 1,200 points since the start of trading yesterday - a reminder that what went up can come down rather abruptly.... Fast FT points out that mining stocks have had a particularly bad 2018: That partly reflects concerns over economic growth prospects, especially if a protracted trade war rumbles on. More drama in the markets, this time involving Turkey: Donald Trump regularly hailed the stock market boom as a sign that he was dong a good job. Now shares are falling, he\u2019s determined to pin the blame on the Federal Reserve. Bloomberg suspects the president has a motive.... Trump\u2019s criticisms mark a stunning departure from the practices of his recent predecessors. Presidents for more than two decades had avoided public comments on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policies as a way of demonstrating respect for the institution\u2019s independence. For a president who has frequently invoked rising stock prices as affirmation for his economic policies, criticism of the Fed\u2019s monetary policies lays ground for shifting blame elsewhere if the market slide continues. He\u2019s escalating his attacks on the Fed with less than a month to go before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress. More here: Trading on Wall Street remains choppy. The Dow is back in the red, down around 115 points (or -0.45%), while the tech-focused Nasdaq index is now slightly higher... Jay Powell, incidentally, was Donald Trump\u2019s pick to run the Fed. The president could have reappointed Janet Yellen, Powell\u2019s predecessor, but instead he favoured a change (even though Yellen had done a good job helping to heal the economy from the financial crisis). Jay Powell may regret ever agreeing to become Fed chair! Donald Trump has unleashed another attack on America\u2019s top central banker, reiterating that he thinks the Federal Reserve is making a mistake. And once again, Trump is breaching the concept that central banks such as the Fed are independent (which is meant to reassure investors). Speaking as Wall Street wobbles today, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates. The dollar is very strong, very powerful \u2013 and it causes difficulty doing business.\u201d Asked if he might sack the Fed chair, Trump replied: No, I\u2019m not going to fire him. I\u2019m just disappointed. Here\u2019s the big picture tonight, and it\u2019s not pretty: The braver, or riskier, among you may see today\u2019s losses as a buying opportunity. I certainly don\u2019t give investment advice. But Trevor Greetham of Royal London Asset Managment believes there are bargains out there: It\u2019s not surprising to see a sharp rise in volatility given the negative cross currents for markets. Global growth is slowing, US interest rates are rising and Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric is hotting up ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections. Longer term, we expect the economic expansion to continue into 2019 and this should ultimately propel stock markets higher. Investors should note that US tax cuts and spending increases are still feeding through, interest rates elsewhere in the world are very low and China is easing policy to offset trade war fears. \u201cOur multi asset funds have been defensively positioned since the early summer but we have started to buy equities on weakness after our investor sentiment gauge hit its most pessimistic reading since April. As another old saying goes, investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d After a day of hectic selling, Britain\u2019s blue chip index has ended the day deep in the red. The blue chip FTSE 100 index has shed almost 2% today, sending it solidly into a correction (10% below its all-time high of 7093 back in May). It has closed 138 points lower at 7,006, its lowest level since April. It\u2019s no brighter across the channel either, where markets have ended at a 21-month low. Ouch! Italy\u2019s main stock index seems to have plunged into a BEAR market - meaning it has fallen by 20% from its recent peak. That shows how worried investors are about its government\u2019s budget plans, and the row with the EU over fiscal targets. European stocks market are also suffering deeper losses as the closing bell looms. The Stoxx 600 index of top European companies is now down 2%, as shares get another mauling. So much for the recovery! The New York stock market has turned south again. The Dow is now down 336 points, or 1.3%, at 25,262 points, adding to yesterday\u2019s 830-point tumble. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 1.3%, while the Nasdaq has shed 1%. So far today, the market has opened lower, recovered, and now taken another leg down. This zig-zag trading shows nervousness and volatility is high. Issues such as the US-China trade wars, Brexit and the Italian budget row are all weighing on markets. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool argues that this week\u2019s \u201cfinancial market turmoil is (long) overdue\u201d. He has sent over this chart, from Policyuncertainty.com, which shows how uncertainty has risenL Profess Milas explains: Global policy uncertainty has hit its highest level for more than 18 months now. In fact, September 2018 saw global policy uncertainty at a level comparable to what we saw during the Referendum vote!!! The chart measures policy uncertainty in 18 countries that account for more than 70% of global GDP. Based on this plot information, I am surprised market reaction did not happen in late September or the very first days of October! Hello... Larry Kudlow, the US president\u2019s chief economic advisor, seems to have suggested that Donald Trump could meet with China\u2019s president Xi soon. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow indicated that talks could take place at the G20 summit in November. However, it seems that nothing is \u2018concrete\u2019, so don\u2019t count on a breakthrough in the trade war yet.... If such Wall Street is gyrating, as investors struggle to decide whether to stick or twist. The Dow has now shaken off its early malaise, and is now up 50 points or 0.2%. It could be a testing day.... Stuart Clark, manager at Quilter\u2019s WealthSelect, reckons automatic trading systems helped to fuel Wednesday\u2019s losses. The sell-off really gained momentum quickly, especially toward the end of trading. That can be a tell-tale sign that algorithm based strategies are kicking in and chasing a trend, which can fuel a rally or a sell-off. While that can\u2019t be ignored, it is important to remember that reflects high volume, short-term trading and isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection of the fundamental case for any given stock.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary has called for calm. Speaking at the IMF meeting in Bali, Stephen Mnuchin steered away from the president\u2019s criticism of the Federal Reserve. Instead, Mnuchin suggested that Wednesday\u2019s sell-off was a fairly normal event. \u201cMarkets go up. Markets go down. I see this as a normal correction.\u201d Yesterday\u2019s sell-off was bad, but it was hardly horrific. Here\u2019s some context: The S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have also dipped into the red in very early trading.... The New York stock exchange has reopened, after suffering its biggest loss in eight months yesterday. And the Dow has opened..... LOWER, dropping by around 100 points in the opening moments. Don\u2019t panic too much, though - it usually takes several minutes before trading is fully underway. Hold onto your hats... Wall Street is about to open for trading. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, reckons investors should \u2018stay calm\u2019 today, rather than panicking. He argues that the world economy isn\u2019t on the brink of a recession, so there\u2019s no reason to dump your portfolio: \u201cIsolating the causes of sharp falls in stock markets is always a hazardous game. The reality is that such drops, as gut churning as they tend to be, are best seen as part and parcel of investing in capital markets. For long term investors, the rising trend is of course more important to focus on than the bumps in the road. For those trying to more actively trade the economic cycle, the key question is whether such volatility speaks of a darker economic turn for the US and world economy, a recession even. For our part we still cannot see the next recession on the horizon in the indicators that we look at. Recessions can, of course, rain from clear blue economic skies, so humility is always appropriate. This is particularly the case as we enter a period where US interest rates approach levels where, if still some distance from asphyxiate, are certainly no longer accommodative for the world\u2019s most important capitalist economy. After a nasty pummelling, European stock markets are trying to climb off the mat. The FTSE 100 has clawed back some losses, following today\u2019s weaker-than-expected US inflation data. It\u2019s still having a bad day, though, currently down 91 points at 7054. Investors are pondering whether today\u2019s sell-off is the start of a downturn, or a buying opportunity.... Newsflash: Donald Trump has renewed his attack on the US Federal Reserve. Speaking to Fox News this morning, the president repeated his claim that the Fed has been too aggressive with its interest rate hikes. Trump said the Fed was getting \u201ca little bit too cute,\u201d adding: \u201cThey\u2019re making a big mistake.\u201d More news: the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen. Some 214,000 US citizens filed an \u2018initial claim\u2019 for jobless help last week, up from 207,000. That could be another reason for the Fed to keep its hand off the trigger.. NEWSFLASH: US inflation didn\u2019t rise as fast as expected last month. This might bring some relief to the troubled markets. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items like oil and food) only rose by 0.1% in September, versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. The means that annual core inflation was unchanged, at 2.2%. The headline inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index, is also weaker than expected. It dropped to 2.3% year-on-year, down from 2.7%. Why does this matter? Because core inflation is a key measure used by the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. So if prices aren\u2019t rising as fast as feared, the Fed might be more reluctant to raise rates aggressively. And that might act as a balm to anxious investors around the globe..... Time for a quick recap. World stock markets are suffering one of their biggest slumps in months, after a shock slide on Wall Street on Wednesday. A wave of selling has sent Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 into correction territory, meaning it has lost most than 10% from its recent record high. It is currently down 113 points, or 1.6%, with house-builders and financial companies leading the rout. There are losses across Europe too; the French CAC is down 1.5% while Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 0.9%. Photos of the sell-off are here. Investors across the globe have been shaken by the losses in New York yesterday - the shock sent Japan\u2019s Nikkei down almost 4%, while China tumbled over 5% to a four-year low. The VIX \u2018fear index\u2019, which tracks anxiety in the markets, has spiked. Analysts are blaming various factors, including the US-China trade war, recent rises in US borrowing costs, and the prospect of several more American interest rate rises. Technology stocks, and luxury goods makers, have been hit hard. The sight of Donald Trump blurring the lines around central bank independence, branding the Federal Reserve \u2018crazy\u2019, hasn\u2019t helped the mood. The world\u2019s top emerging nations have also weighed in, warning that trade wars are hurting their economies. Wall Street could suffer further losses when trading begins in around 80 minutes. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: While U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates played a role behind the steep selloff, there were other key factors brewing in the background. It is becoming clear that global equity markets are facing a perfect storm of headwinds such as rising U.S. bond yields, U.S.-China trade disputes, global growth concerns and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates. For as long as these themes remain, appetite for stocks are likely to diminish further consequently fueling speculation over the bull party coming to an end. Asian stocks fell sharply during early trade to close in the red while European shares slumped this morning. With the negative sentiment from Asian and European markets deterring investors from riskier assets, Wall Street is at threat of trading lower this afternoon. The oil price has also been dragged down today. Brent crude has sled $1.5 per barrel, or almost 2%, to $81.57. That reflects concerns that trade wars and higher US interest rates could hurt global growth. Here\u2019s a video clip of the head of the IMF defending America\u2019s top central banker against Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the Federal Reserve has \u2018gone crazy\u2019: Tech has been the golden child for markets this year. But now it\u2019s being disowned by investors, who rushed to ditch internet giants like Amazon (down 6% yesterday), Apple (which dropped 4.8%) Netflix (which shed 8%). One theory is that people are taking profits - there\u2019s a temptation to cash in your winning stocks when you see shares diving. Another theory is that tech firms will suffer particularly badly from a full-blown trade war, which looks increasingly likely unless Washington and Beijing start mending fences. Thirdly, some technology stocks are highly-leveraged, having issued large amounts of debt to fund their growth. So if US interest rates keep rising, their borrowing costs could become rather higher. Even crypto-currencies are being caught up in today\u2019s selloff. Bitcoin has shed 5% today to trade around $6,200 at present, down $300 today. Here some photos showing how the stock sell-off has ripped around the world. It started in New York yesterday when a late slump wiped 3% off the value of the US stock market, while tech stocks suffered particularly badly. This set Asia up for a fall - with Japan\u2019s main indices losing over 3.5% Australia was also pulled into the mire; its S&amp;P/ASX index shed 2.7%, led by energy and technology companies. Cue more pain in China, where stocks slumped by over 5%. This dragged the market down to its lowest level since 2014, as traders worried that the economy is suffering from the trade war with America. European investors then picked up the baton, and conducted a selling operation of their own. Heavy losses on all the main exchanges has wiped almost 2% off the Stoxx 600 index, down to to lowest level since the end of 2016. And with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 still down over 100 points, and in correction territory (10% below its record high), it\u2019s been a bad morning in the City. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says investors have been speculating for weeks that a correction was coming - and now \u201cwe\u2019ve talked ourselves into a sell-off\u201d. Miah pins the blame on trade war fears, and the prospect of higher US borrowing costs: \u201cThe sell-off has been gathering strength for about two weeks now lead by the Asian markets as concerns were raised about China\u2019s growth rate, but fingers will also point at the hike in tariffs between the US and China and the impending trade wars. \u201cBut for us and many other analysts, a market sell-off was always going to be most likely as a result of the rising interest rate environment, especially in the US. We had the much expected hike in September from the US Federal Reserve now taking interest rates to 2.25% with the expectation that the policy makers will keep in their path of steady rate hikes as the US economy strengthened. But with unemployment recently hitting 3.7%, and as signs slack in the economy and with the labour market disappearing, there is the expectation that prices and inflation could start running ahead of the Fed\u2019s expectations. As a result, the policymakers may now think about increasing rates at a faster pace than anticipated. Over in New York, financial workers will be rising early and inspecting the damage across the global markets. Wall Street got an early taste of the rout, of course, when the Dow plunged by over 800 points in late trading on Wednesday. US traders can now see that the shockwave rippled to Asia, sending major indices down by 3%, and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 is down 1.8% now. And the bad news is that New York is expected to suffer fresh losses today. The futures market suggests the Dow will fall by another 1%, when trading begins again, in three and a half hours time. Just in: A group of leading developing countries are calling for an end to the trade wars that have gripped the global economy this year. The G24, which includes China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, say the global trading system should be reformed, not smashed up. In a statement issued in Bali, alongside the IMF\u2019s meeting his week, the G24 warn that emerging markets are suffering: \u201cTrade uncertainties and financial and monetary conditions compound rising debt vulnerabilities. Improving debt sustainability depends on a supportive external trade and financial environment, timely contingency financing and the adequate flow of concessional financing for low income countries.\u201d Back in the UK, a new Bank of England survey shows that it\u2019s harder to get access to credit, as lenders tighten up: There\u2019s no relief in the City. After two hours of bruising trading, the FTSE 100 sinking deeper into correction territory, down 123 points or 1.7% at 7022. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors have been perturbed by New York\u2019s 3% slump yesterday. Wednesday\u2019s plunge on Wall Street came as a shock and global markets are now readjusting. Sellers shaved 830 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 4% of Nasdaq with big tech names like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft bearing the brunt of the decline. The picture is not looking much better this morning. The Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite closed over 4% and 5.7% lower respectively, the FTSE started the day with a 1.19% decline and continued to sink from there. She also explains how the recent rise in US bond yields - because investors expect higher inflation and interest rates - is now hurting stocks: The plunge in US stock markets comes after a long run of almost undisrupted gains on Wall Street which were bound to come up for a correction. The strong US economic background that has supported share prices this year is now working against that same market. Rising interest rates are fuelling concerns that higher borrowing costs will erode the margins of US companies and with the domestic labour market at its strongest in nearly 50 years, wage pressures are filtering into companies\u2019 costs. The 10-year Treasury yield is used as a reference price for mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt and a spike in those yields is hitting industries like car makers and house builders that are exposed to consumer borrowing. The VIX volatility index has hit its highest level since April, following the hefty losses seen in the markets in recent days. The number of contracts for trading the VIX has also jumped, showing that traders expect the current market volatility to continue. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management blames the Wall Street sell-off on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods: US equities seem to be (finally) reflecting the cost of US President Trump\u2019s trade taxes. Around 80% of global trade involves multinational (generally listed) companies. A bit less than half of S&amp;P earnings come from outside the US. However, listed companies are only 25% of the US economy. Equities are at greater risk than the economy if trade is taxed aggressively. Here\u2019s a taste of the mood on the trading floors today: China\u2019s stock market has closed at its lowest level in almost four years, as the trade war with America continues to bite. The Shanghai composite index ended the day down 5.2% its heftiest rout in over two years. Trading screens were a sea of green, not red, though (as red is a lucky colour, it is used to show rising prices in China) Today\u2019s sell-off has dragged the FTSE 100 index into a correction! The blue-chip index has now lost more than 10% of its value since May, when it traded at an all-time high of 7,903 points. That\u2019s a blow to anyone whose invested money in UK stocks in recent months. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has helpfully drawn up a list of the key factors behind the sell-off: Rising bond yields \u2013 the sharp rally last week was the cue for a sustained period of declines which culminated in yesterday\u2019s selloff. Now we have a lot of momentum \u2013 the breadth of the decline \u2013 we could see things get worse before rallying. China and trade \u2013 we thought that Nafta was important but really the fear is that we see the Sino-US tensions get worse. Comments around currency manipulation have not helped risk sentiment. No resolution can be expected until after the mid-terms. Fears around luxury stocks and comments from LVMH on Chinese demand have raised some concerns around earnings. Italy \u2013 the ongoing Rome-Brussels spat is keeping European investors in a risk-off stance. Fresh valuation concerns heading into earnings season Yikes! World stock markets have slumped to their lowest level since February. That\u2019s according to data provider MSCI, whose \u2018all country\u2019 index has careered down to an eight-month low this morning. That\u2019s thanks to the triple-whammy of losses in Wall Street, the rout on Asia, and this morning\u2019s heavy early losses in Europe. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says some frightened investors are ditching stocks: European stocks are the latest casualty in the global sell-off that has rattled markets over the last 24 hours, as investors worry about the potential for a sharper correction on the back of rising bond yields. It\u2019s been something of a bloodbath overnight, as investors saw what occurred in the US \u2013 despite there being no clear catalyst for such a move - and dashed for the exits as fears grow that global risks are mounting and the bill is coming due. While people are naturally pointing to the bond market to explain the sudden panic \u2013 most notably Trump who\u2019s been laying the groundwork for blaming the Fed for the last couple of months \u2013 I wonder whether the underlying risk in the markets for some time has left market primed for a correction and investors have simply fled at the first sign of danger. Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International, argues the sell-off in America isn\u2019t a shock: \u201cThe sharp sell-off in the US has likely caught no one by surprise. If anything, investors have been wondering how, in the face of tighter monetary policy, a contracting labour market and rising oil prices, the US has continued to be so resilient. Ouch! European stock markets have plunged to their lowest level in 20 month. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the largest shares in the region, has slumped by 1.6% today to its lowest level since the start of February 2017. Every sector is taking a chilly bath: Eurozone stocks are being dragged down the row between Rome and Brussels over Italy\u2019s new budget, on top of today\u2019s other concerns. Housebuilders and financial stocks are among the big fallers in London this morning: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new six-month low at the start of trading. The wave of selling that began in Wall Street last night, and swept through Asia today, has now reached the City. The Footsie has shed 113 points, or 1.58%. That takes it down to 7032 points, its lowest level since early April. Nearly every share has fallen. One rare exception being gold miner Randgold (as traders scramble for safe-haven assets). David Madden of CMC Markets says: The prospect of higher interest rates has left trader worried, as it means higher borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Homebuilders are under pressure as mortgage rates are likely to increase. Retailers are suffering for the same reason. Investors in Asia are reeling after a rather brutal day in the markets. China\u2019s Shanghai index is now down over 6%, as worries over the US trade war intensify. Chinese stocks have now lost more than a fifth of their value this year. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that the sell-off will continue: This slump is not going to be over that easily as Asia have already borne the burnt of this year\u2019s trade war, which is fuelled with nothing but uncertainty. The Chinese markets are already in the bear territory so I expect the U.S. markets to continue to face the selling pressure. Boom! Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has waded in. Speaking at the Fund\u2019s meeting in Bali, Lagarde insisted that it was \u201clegitimate and necessary\u201d for the Federal Reserve to be raising interest rates. That\u2019s a rebuke to Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the Fed is going crazy. Touching on the slide in the markets, Lagarde pointed out that US stocks have hit record levels recently - suggesting that a correction should be expected. \u201cIt is fair to observe and all people are observing that the US equity market and stock markets in general have been extremely high\u201d. The FT has more details. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, argues that Trump must take some of the blame for the market losses: While I agree with President Trump that Wednesday\u2019s selloff is the fault of the Fed, he should be reminded that the trade war he started with China and re-imposing sanctions on Iran is also to blame. His actions helped building inflationary pressures and the Fed cannot stand still when it sees the economy overheating. A steeper selloff in equity markets will probably lead to a pause in hiking rates, but the Fed will be more concerned about the overall economy performance than just equity prices. The widening rift between the US and China is driving shares down, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Marcella Chow: Headlines around the broadening US-China conflict also continue to worsen as the U.S. arrested and extradited a Chinese official in Belgium to face espionage charges. There are concerns over a 3Q earnings rise following recent profit warnings and weak reports. In particular, Fastenal\u2019s CEO said the trade war with China is raising material costs that will crimp profit margins and hurt US consumers, and French luxury goods maker LVMH confirmed Chinese border guards are more actively searching travelers\u2019 suitcases for undeclared goods added to fears of a slowdown in spending by Chinese consumers. Charles Ripley, senior strategist at Allianz Investment Management, blames the prospect of higher interest rates: \u201cToday\u2019s equity selloff is a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell. Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.\u201d Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, agrees: \u201cThis is much more interest-rate related than anything going on specifically with tech. Interest rates are moving higher, so stocks that are the most expensive typically are the ones that roll over. Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, points to recent falls in the value of US government debt (or Treasury Bills). That has pushed up the yield on these bonds - a sign that investors expect inflation and interest rates to rise The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook. It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.\u201d Good morning from London. World stock markets are sliding today as the anxiety that has been building in recent days explodes into a wave of selling. Shares have fallen sharply across Asia, after Wall Street suffered their worst sell off in eight months overnight, wiping 800 points, or 3%, off the Dow Jones industrial average. The rout has sent Japan\u2019s Nikkei into a tailspin, shedding 4%. Stocks in Hong Kong are down 3.8%, and there are chunky losses in Australia (-2.8%) and South Korea (4%) too. My colleague Martin Farrer explains from Australia: A jittery, volatile week on global financial markets has burst into a frenzy of selling, triggered by heavy losses on Wall Street and comments by Donald Trump describing US interest rate hikes as \u201ccrazy\u201d.... \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a bloodbath,\u201d said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u201d European markets had already endured a bad week, and it\u2019s about to get worse. Traders are predicting that Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 will plunge to a new six-month low this morning, perhaps shedding more than 100 points. The rout is being fuelled by concerns that US interest rates are heading higher, as the Federal Reserve tries to keep a lid on American inflation. Donald Trump added to the pressure overnight, branding the Fed \u2018crazy\u2019 for planning to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead. Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania that: \u201cThe Fed has gone crazy. \u201cNo, I think the Fed is making a mistake. They\u2019re so tight.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a correction we\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time, but I really disagree with what the Fed is doing.\u201d The president neglected to mention that its his relaxed fiscal policy, and recent tax cuts, are one factor pushing Federal Reserve governors to hike. Worries over the US trade war with China (another Trump \u2018achievement\u2019), are also worrying investors, after the IMF slashed its growth forecasts earlier this week. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says Wall Street has finally caught up with events: For much of 2018, the US economy has been oblivious to a turn in the global economic cycle, and the US equity market has been unaffected as emerging market equities and currencies have come under pressure. This week has seen the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq, sit up and pay attention to what\u2019s going on. The President\u2019s criticism of the Fed adds colour, but no real substance to the situation. Later today we get new US inflation figures, which could also move the markets. If price pressures keep mounting, the Fed will feel that it needs to keep raising borrowing costs, despite chuntering from the White House.
