      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s largest companies, British American Tobacco (BAT) is facing demands that it be investigated by the US Department of Justice, following allegations that it engaged in widespread bribery of politicians and policymakers in Africa. Several Democratic senators and congressmen have written a letter calling for the department to launch an immediate investigation into BAT, the world\u2019s second-largest publicly traded tobacco company, which has its headquarters in London. The politicians, led by congressman Lloyd Doggett and senator Richard Blumenthal, suggest that BAT\u2019s actions may have violated both the Anti-Bribery and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Acts (FCPA). If proven, the allegations \u2013 denied by BAT \u2013 could result in jail terms for the company\u2019s executives. Some of the allegations about BAT\u2019s activities in parts of Africa first surfaced in a BBC Panorama documentary last year. Since then, US lawmakers say that additional documents have come to light, which they claim suggest alleged bribery may have been more widespread than previously thought. It is alleged that the documents raise questions as to whether BAT paid people off to protect its corporate reputation and to cover up scandals, including environmental damage caused by a warehouse fire in Uganda. There are also claims that the company engaged in corporate espionage and the sabotage of competitors in Kenya. \u201cIf true, these allegations would demonstrate a deplorable choice by BAT to balloon its profits through bribery at the expense of the health of millions,\u201d said Doggett. \u201cAny corporation that enjoys the benefits of our stock exchange must comply with our anti-bribery laws.\u201d The US is a signatory to the World Health Organisation\u2019s global tobacco treaty, set up to stop tobacco companies from influencing policy. The treaty, which protects more than 90% of the world\u2019s population, could save 200 million lives by 2050 if fully implemented. But measures to undermine it, by illegally influencing politicians, limit the treaty\u2019s impact. \u201cThe tobacco industry has a long history of placing profits above public health and these allegations raise clear questions about whether BAT violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \u2013 a question the DoJ must answer,\u201d said Blumenthal, who sits on the judiciary committee which oversees the FCPA. \u201cWith tobacco companies exploiting growth opportunities in Africa, actions like BAT\u2019s threaten to undermine the WHO\u2019s global tobacco treaty and condemn the entire continent to generations of smoking, cancer and preventable death.\u201d Smoking-related diseases cause six million deaths a year worldwide, making tobacco the largest preventable cause of death, according to health experts. Successfully expanding operations in Africa is crucial to the future fortunes of big tobacco. The number of adult smokers on the continent is projected to increase from 77 million in 2013 to 572 million by the end of the century. Pressure groups seeking to check big tobacco\u2019s influence would welcome a Department of Justice investigation. \u201cIn the 1990s, the public health movement exposed big tobacco\u2019s lies about nicotine\u2019s addictiveness and tobacco\u2019s links to cancer, sparking a cascade of litigation and US tobacco control policies,\u201d said John Stewart, deputy campaign director of Corporate Accountability International. \u201cThis investigation could be the next critical chapter in holding this deadly industry accountable for its abuses, preventing the expansion of the single largest preventable epidemic on the planet.\u201d A British American Tobacco spokesman said that the company would comply with any investigation. \u201cWe have not heard from the US Department of Justice regarding any of the historic allegations made by Panorama last year but, if we do, we will of course cooperate with them,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIn the meantime, we take the allegations of historic misconduct in East Africa extremely seriously and are working with our external legal counsel to fully investigate all these claims.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Decision time over Europe is approaching for British voters. The publication last week of proposals to renegotiate the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union set the clock ticking on a referendum that could take place in less than six months. It should also ring alarm bells among those who want Britain to stay in the EU. A shock YouGov poll, taken in the wake of David Cameron welcoming the proposals, pointed to a vote in favour of Brexit, which has hit the pound and sparked alarm among City economists. They have come up with doomsday scenarios of lost jobs, lower investment and weak economic growth if Britain chooses to sever links with Brussels. But while the big business lobby groups have long supported remaining in the EU, a number of business figures are putting forward an alternative view. Leaving the EU would liberate the UK economy and individual firms, they say. It would mean savings for taxpayers, less red tape for employers and more control over trade deals, the Leave camp argues. As with the Scottish referendum last year, economic questions are expected to make a pivotal contribution to the in/out debate. We asked business leaders and other opinion-formers what they make of the draft reform deal with the EU and how they want Britain to vote. SIR MARTIN SORRELL Chief executive of WPP Whether the prime minister has done enough to secure a Yes vote remains unclear. The latest polls suggest a lead for the Leave campaign, but they also show that the gap would be significantly smaller if other EU countries accept the changes David Cameron is proposing. Critically, a large proportion of voters is still undecided, and polls have in any case been a less than reliable means of predicting recent election results. From a personal point of view, I hope the UK does not vote for Brexit as the EU, for all its faults, is a net positive for the British economy. JACQUELINE GOLD Chief executive of Ann Summers I believe we are better together and I hope that last week\u2019s draft document goes some way to convincing others that Britain is better in Europe than out. David Cameron has made significant gains with the draft document that I have been impressed with, such as cutting red tape for business and the recognition that non-eurozone countries would not be required to bail out single-currency members. I look forward to seeing the final document once negotiations have finished. What I hope the public realise is that the implications of leaving the EU are greater than immigration alone, which is the issue that has grabbed the majority of the headlines. I don\u2019t dispute immigration is an issue that needs consideration and it is one that I care greatly about. But it is just one element \u2013 and I hope that as we approach a referendum, voters will put that in perspective. Leaving the EU will, for business, mean the renegotiation of many deals and trade agreements, which will have cost implications for businesses which will cause secondary impacts in relation to higher prices and access to jobs. Nearly half of all of our exports go to Europe, and in return Britain gets \u00a324bn of investment from the EU. Cutting ourselves off from Europe puts that investment, and the 3 million jobs that rely on it, in jeopardy. LORD (DIGBY) JONES Ex-head of the CBI; chair, Triumph Motorcycles Five hundred and twenty million people living in sustainable peace for more than 70 years deserve better from a self-serving, unaccountable, unelected Brussels elite, distanced by far more than kilometres from those affected by their rules and regulations. We must have a Europe which is globally competitive in Asia\u2019s century. Where is the committed reform to make life easier for a small business-woman trying to employ one extra person? Where is the skilling-up of southern European youth so they are marketable and welcome in northern Europe or can contribute to and enjoy economic success at home? If they carry on exporting subsidised olives and importing BMWs they will continue to go bust! What\u2019s on offer isn\u2019t the reform that this once-in-a-lifetime referendum opportunity warrants. It might appeal to gut political instinct, but surely we all deserve better than this. GAVIN PATTERSON Chief executive of BT BT earns close to a fifth of its revenues outside the UK. So continued membership of a reformed EU is important to us, and to all those we employ and serve. British companies need to prosper if the UK\u2019s bills for health, education and welfare are to be paid. We value having open markets in Europe, where we supply services to public bodies and large corporations. Indeed, most of the EU institutions are served by us, as are Nato and the embassies of several member states. We also value the sheer heft of the EU when it comes to arguing our case in world trade talks. We are trying to get a fairer deal for the business we operate in America, and having the whole EU on our side counts. The prime minister seems to have secured the promise of important changes to the way the EU is run. It is reassuring that those promises will be turned into a form that is legally binding. The prime minister\u2019s negotiations are far from complete, but he deserves support for what he\u2019s trying to achieve. ANDREW SENTANCE Former Bank of England interest-rate setter Is Brexit now more likely? There are clearly important issues which the UK government is negotiating with our European partners, but the question over whether or not we leave the EU is more fundamental. Do we continue with an economic arrangement which has served the UK economy very well for 40-plus years? Or do we embark on a very uncertain path outside the EU? We should choose stability over uncertainty and remain, in my view. The process of the referendum may create some uncertainty, but British business is very resilient. Some investment decisions may be postponed for a few months, but I don\u2019t think that will be a big factor. If the UK leaves the EU, however, the implications will be more profound. Investments coming to the UK because we are a member of the EU could be reversed. All our trade relationships \u2013 both within the EU and with the wider world \u2013 would have to be reconsidered and renegotiated. And there would be a massive task of disentangling UK regulation from the current framework of EU law. None of this looks positive from an economic perspective. LANCE FORMAN Owner of H Forman &amp; Son salmon smokery The prime minister has tried to spin this week\u2019s draft renegotiation of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU as a significant win. It\u2019s not. My business is Britain\u2019s oldest salmon curer. We continually suffer from costly, ever-changing EU rules, such as food labelling, which may work for larger corporates but do not work for small businesses like ours. Small businesses are the drivers of Britain\u2019s economic success and all we want is the freedom to get on and trade, and generate wealth and employment. The European trading bloc was established before anyone had conceived of the internet and now we can trade just as easily with customers and suppliers in India, China, Singapore and Argentina \u2013 and we do, at the press of a button. Being geographically close for trade is irrelevant in the 21st century. The EU has passed its sell-by date. Britain will be stronger unrestrained by the EU. We should vote to leave. CAROLYN MCCALL Chief executive of easyJet EasyJet is proud to connect people and businesses across Europe and believes that the UK is better off as part of the EU. That is why we are a supporter of the Stronger In campaign which is helping to make the case for Britain to remain part of Europe. Aviation is a good example of the benefits of the EU. The single aviation area gives airlines freedom to fly across Europe and since its introduction passengers have seen fares fall by around 40% and routes increase by 170%. JAYNE-ANNE GADHIA Chief executive of Virgin Money Many businesspeople over the years have bemoaned the fact that it seems to take forever to deal with the bureaucrats in Brussels and longer to get anything done. It is in that light that we should see David Cameron\u2019s latest negotiations. In my view they represent positive progress on the key issues regarding British sovereignty \u2013 and all done quickly and co-operatively. The terms give us the best of both worlds: the prioritisation of British interests, continued access to the single market, currency stability, job opportunities and prosperity. I am not someone who wanted to remain in Europe without winning concessions. But we have them and they are good. Let\u2019s lock them down and get on with the referendum. The uncertainty is bad for investors, businesses and the economy. That can be repaired. A vote to exit the union now would subject UK business to uncertainty, trade restraints and job losses for years to come. LUCA VISENTINI European Trade Union Confederation It is not the right deal for the UK or for European workers. We think the UK should stay in the European Union but not at any cost, and reducing the rights of mobile workers [ie other EU citizens working in the UK] would be a cost. If there will be this kind of concession, it will damage British workers, because it will turn mobile workers into cheap labour. There are a lot of unfair elements in this deal. It is a tricky situation \u2026 We are strongly lobbying for the UK to stay in and we are strongly lobbying the other member states not to accept these conditions. If the UK were to vote to leave there would be terrible consequences for economic growth, for the economic performance of the UK. There is a risk that social benefits and employment standards in the UK \u2013 which are not the highest in the EU \u2013 could be undermined. PASCAL LAMY Former director general of the WTO I believe Brexit would be very bad news for Europe, as well as very bad news for the UK. It is pretty obvious that the case for the UK outside the European Union in trade is just terrible; the UK would be naked in the cold and the price of clothing would be very high. This proposal looks like a good balance for the UK reform requests. There is meat in there and yet it would not prevent other countries who want to further integrate from doing it. This reform renegotiation is only part one of the show; there will be a second act, which is the campaign. My own sense is [that this draft settlement] will not dispense David Cameron and his government from articulating a pro-European narrative \u2013 a narrative we have not seen for the past 30 years or so. This must be a narrative of heat and guts, not only reason. You have to speak to hearts and guts, not only minds. MIKE CHERRY Policy director, Federation of Small Businesses In October we conducted the biggest ever study into what small businesses want from the EU referendum, speaking to more than 6,000 small firms. Our research found nearly half of our members (47%) leaning towards voting to remain in the EU, with two fifths (40%) leaning towards voting to leave. However, about one in 10 are still undecided (10.7%) and so much could change before voting day. However, the standout demand was for clear, unambiguous, and impartial information. While small business will welcome the latest information to come out of the prime minister\u2019s negotiations, the agreement is still only a draft and it remains uncertain what the final settlement will be. Throughout the process we have been clear what small businesses want from any settlement: protection of the single market, simplifying of VAT and regulations to promote cross border trade, and maintaining the opt-out from the European Working Time Directive. Many small firms have told us they need to know how any final agreement will impact their business before they make up their minds. CAMERON\u2019S DEAL EXPLAINED European Council president Donald Tusk has announced his proposals for \u201ca new settlement\u201d between the UK and the EU. Here are the key points: Immigration The prime minister wanted people coming to Britain from the EU to be barred from claiming in-work benefits or social housing for four years. Under the draft proposals, Britain would be able to request an \u201cemergency brake\u201d on in-work benefits for up to four years, subject to permission from other member states. Economic governance Cameron wanted an explicit statement that the EU had more than one currency and that taxpayers in non-eurozone countries should never be liable for operations to shore up the eurozone. The draft promises UK taxpayers\u2019 money cannot be used to support the euro and that supervision of financial institutions in non-eurozone countries will remain a matter for national governments. But the UK will have to pledge not to \u201ccreate obstacles\u201d to deeper integration in the eurozone. Competitiveness Cameron wanted less regulation and a stronger commitment to the free flow of capital, goods and services. The draft document commits to taking concrete steps towards better regulation. Sovereignty The PM wanted an end to the obligation to work towards \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 one of the founding principles of the EU. Tusk offered a declaration that the UK is \u201cnot committed to further political integration\u201d.",

They have come up with doomsday scenarios of lost jobs, lower investment and weak economic growth if Britain chooses to sever links with Brussels.</p> <p>But while the big business lobby groups have long supported remaining in the EU, a number of business figures are putting forward an alternative view. Leaving the EU would liberate the UK economy and individual firms, they say. It would mean savings for taxpayers, less red tape for employers and more control over trade deals, the Leave camp argues.</p> <p>As with the Scottish referendum last year, economic questions are expected to make a pivotal contribution to the in/out debate. We asked business leaders and other opinion-formers what they make of the draft reform deal with the EU and how they want Britain to vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8403e6a62f8e8692822ac743c3a9e46d7bb82129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8403e6a62f8e8692822ac743c3a9e46d7bb82129/859_57_1575_2363/667.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sorrell\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Sorrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>SIR MARTIN SORRELL</strong></h2> <p><strong>Chief executive of WPP</strong></p> <p>Whether the prime minister has done enough to secure a Yes vote remains unclear. The latest polls suggest a lead for the Leave campaign, but they also show that the gap would be significantly smaller if other EU countries accept the changes David Cameron is proposing. Critically, a large proportion of voters is still undecided, and polls have in any case been a less than reliable means of predicting recent election results.</p> <p>From a personal point of view, I hope the UK does not vote for Brexit as the EU, for all its faults, is a net positive for the British economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"529b9ddec1f4bd275153a81c1ed3a13470c83874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/529b9ddec1f4bd275153a81c1ed3a13470c83874/372_78_1750_2624/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jacqueline Gold\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacqueline Gold</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>JACQUELINE GOLD</strong></h2> <p><strong>Chief executive of Ann Summers</strong></p> <p>I believe we are better together and I hope that last week\u2019s draft document goes some way to convincing others that Britain is better in Europe than out.</p> <p>David Cameron has made significant gains with the draft document that I have been impressed with, such as cutting red tape for business and the recognition that non-eurozone countries would not be required to bail out single-currency members.

But it is just one element \u2013 and I hope that as we approach a referendum, voters will put that in perspective.</p> <p>Leaving the EU will, for business, mean the renegotiation of many deals and trade agreements, which will have cost implications for businesses which will cause secondary impacts in relation to higher prices and access to jobs.

We should choose stability over uncertainty and remain, in my view.</p> <p>The process of the referendum may create some uncertainty, but British business is very resilient. Some investment decisions may be postponed for a few months, but I don\u2019t think that will be a big factor.</p> <p>If the UK leaves the EU, however, the implications will be more profound. Investments coming to the UK because we are a member of the EU could be reversed.

The draft promises UK taxpayers\u2019 money cannot be used to support the euro and that supervision of financial institutions in non-eurozone countries will remain a matter for national governments. But the UK will have to pledge not to \u201ccreate obstacles\u201d to deeper integration in the eurozone.</p> <p><strong>Competitiveness</strong><br>Cameron wanted less regulation and a stronger commitment to the free flow of capital, goods and services. The draft document commits to taking concrete steps towards better regulation.</p> <p><strong>Sovereignty</strong><br>The PM wanted an end to the obligation to work towards \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 one of the founding principles of the EU.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong hoisted the Stars and Stripes on the moon, the act was purely symbolic. Two years earlier, mindful of Cold War animosity, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) had decreed that outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, \u201cis not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty\u201d. In other words no country, not even the US, could own the moon or any other part of space, regardless of how many flags they erected there. Half a century on, though, the OST could prove the biggest obstacle to one of the most exciting new frontiers of space exploration: asteroid mining. The reason lawyers could soon be poring over that 48-year-old document is that space mining could become a reality within a couple of decades. In what is being seen as a major breakthrough for this embryonic technology, the government of Luxembourg has thrown its financial muscle behind plans to extract resources from asteroids, some of which are rich in platinum and other valuable metals. It plans to team up with private companies to help speed the progress of the industry and draw up a regulatory framework for it. One such firm, Deep Space Industries, wants to send small satellites, called Fireflies, into space from 2017 to prospect for minerals and ice. The satellites would hitch a ride on a rocket, and larger craft would then be used to harvest, transport and store raw materials. Metals such as nickel and iron, which are plentiful on Earth, could be processed while in orbit and used to build equipment or spacecraft. And it may eventually be possible to extract valuable minerals from asteroids cheaply enough for it to be worth bringing them back to Earth. Rival Planetary Resources has a slightly different plan, in which telescopes would be used to analyse asteroids before craft were sent to mine them. Its backers include Google co-founder Larry Page and billionaire businessman Ross Perot, and it thinks it could be operating in space by 2025. One of the difficulties facing these would-be space miners is cost, which is fittingly astronomical. Nasa\u2019s Osiris-Rex expedition, which aims to bring just two kilos of asteroid material back to Earth by 2023, is set to cost $1bn. But Deep Space Industries thinks it can get the ball rolling by putting three of its Fireflies in space for just $20m. The other obvious barrier is the technological progress that is still required if commercial asteroid mining is to become practically possible and economically viable. However, considerable as these hurdles are, experts believe the legal component is the most pressing. Late last year, the US government made an attempt to update the law on space mining, producing a bill that allows companies to \u201cpossess, own, transport, use, and sell\u201d extra-terrestrial resources without violating US law. The problem is that putting this into practice violates the OST. \u201cThe way a private company would enforce their right to mine is through a national court,\u201d says space law expert Dr Chris Newman of the University of Sunderland. \u201cIn making a ruling, that court would exercise sovereign rights, contravening the OST. We will only know how this would play out if it is tested in court.\u201d US lawyer Michael Listner, who founded thinktank Space Law and Policy Solutions, says the US law is incompatible with the OST and risks souring international relations: \u201cChina and Russia will want in. If you have conflicts of law, things start getting dicey and that could lead to legal and political conflict.\u201d Newman believes that one reason why Luxembourg has included plans for drawing up a regulatory framework is to show the world that work is under way on untangling such legal knots. \u201cThis is something for investors to hang their hat on,\u201d he says, \u201cto give them confidence and say that there is a nascent legal framework.\u201d But Dr Gbenga Oduntan, a space law expert at the University of Kent, warns that the international community needs to get its act together quickly. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is a free-for-all over asteroids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to come together and do that thinking, because the law we have right now does not allow us to repatriate resources for commercial purposes.\u201d One way to do this, he suggests, is to draw on existing legislation such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which governs how nations use the ocean. Another option might be to revive the Moon Treaty of 1979, which deemed space to be the \u201ccommon heritage of mankind\u201d but failed to win support from any space-faring nation. Such complex legal wrangles could indeed prove harder to overcome than other difficulties, such as the huge costs involved. But some experts believe that investing large amounts early on could create a space economy in which costs are forced down by collaboration. Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, London, says asteroid miners would most probably start off by mining water-ice, which can be broken down into hydrogen (for fuel) and oxygen (for supporting life). It is much cheaper to produce water in space than to take it there, and this process could generate revenue and technical support from other players in the space game. Once companies had that revenue stream under their belts, they could start thinking more seriously about the more costly business of extracting minerals and bringing them back to Earth. \u201cEventually you can imagine the whole process supporting itself,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cThe main hurdle is the initial investment, and it seems these companies think they can get started and jump over that hurdle.\u201d But he agrees that the more pressing concern is the legal picture, which \u201cbadly needs to be updated\u201d. Christopher Barnatt, professional futurist and author of The Next Big Thing: From 3D Printing to Mining the Moon, says history shows us that if governments such as Luxembourg\u2019s get behind asteroid mining, the space industry will deliver on its promise. \u201cWith the moon landings, the aspiration was way ahead of the technology. [President] Kennedy had spoken to Nasa and they\u2019d said it couldn\u2019t be done. He thought it could. We\u2019ve got evidence from throughout history that when we commit ourselves to a broad goal, we can achieve it.\u201d The ramifications could be huge, he believes, as progress in one technology spurs breakthroughs in another. \u201cIf you can use asteroids to make fuel, a lot of space exploration becomes cheaper. Then there\u2019s progress in robotics and artificial intelligence... it all starts to make things possible.\u201d",

Two years earlier, mindful of Cold War animosity, <a href=\"http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html\">the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST)</a> had decreed that outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, \u201cis not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty\u201d.</p> <p>In other words no country, not even the US, could own the moon or any other part of space, regardless of how many flags they erected there. Half a century on, though, the OST could prove the biggest obstacle to one of the most exciting new frontiers of space exploration: asteroid mining.</p> <p>The reason lawyers could soon be poring over that 48-year-old document is that space mining could become a reality within a couple of decades.</p> <p>In what is being seen as a major breakthrough for this embryonic technology, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/03/luxembourg-aims-to-be-big-player-in-possible-asteroid-mining\">the government of Luxembourg has thrown its financial muscle behind plans to extract resources from asteroids</a>, some of which are rich in platinum and other valuable metals. It plans to team up with private companies to help speed the progress of the industry and draw up a regulatory framework for it.</p> <p>One such firm, <a href=\"https://deepspaceindustries.com/\">Deep Space Industries</a>, wants to send small satellites, called Fireflies, into space from 2017 to prospect for minerals and ice. The satellites would hitch a ride on a rocket, and larger craft would then be used to harvest, transport and store raw materials.</p> <p>Metals such as nickel and iron, which are plentiful on Earth, could be processed while in orbit and used to build equipment or spacecraft. And it may eventually be possible to extract valuable minerals from asteroids cheaply enough for it to be worth bringing them back to Earth.</p> <p>Rival <a href=\"http://www.planetaryresources.com/\">Planetary Resources</a> has a slightly different plan, in which telescopes would be used to analyse asteroids before craft were sent to mine them. Its backers include Google co-founder Larry Page and billionaire businessman Ross Perot, and it thinks it could be operating in space by 2025.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/feb/06/how-would-asteroid-mining-work-a-visual-guide\">How would asteroid mining work? A visual guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the difficulties facing these would-be space miners is cost, which is fittingly astronomical. <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/missions/osiris-rex/\">Nasa\u2019s Osiris-Rex expedition</a>, which aims to bring just two kilos of asteroid material back to Earth by 2023, is set to cost $1bn. But Deep Space Industries thinks it can get the ball rolling by putting three of its Fireflies in space for just $20m.</p> <p>The other obvious barrier is the technological progress that is still required if commercial asteroid mining is to become practically possible and economically viable.</p> <p>However, considerable as these hurdles are, experts believe the legal component is the most pressing. Late last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/13/congress-claims-space-resource-rights-for-americans-to-exploit-new-frontier\">US government made an attempt to update the law on space mining, </a>producing a bill that allows companies to \u201cpossess, own, transport, use, and sell\u201d extra-terrestrial resources without violating US law. The problem is that putting this into practice violates the OST.</p> <p>\u201cThe way a private company would enforce their right to mine is through a national court,\u201d says space law expert Dr Chris Newman of the University of Sunderland. \u201cIn making a ruling, that court would exercise sovereign rights, contravening the OST. We will only know how this would play out if it is tested in court.\u201d</p> <p>US lawyer Michael Listner, who founded thinktank Space Law and Policy Solutions, says the US law is incompatible with the OST and risks souring international relations: \u201cChina and Russia will want in. If you have conflicts of law, things start getting dicey and that could lead to legal and political conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Newman believes that one reason why Luxembourg has included plans for drawing up a regulatory framework is to show the world that work is under way on untangling such legal knots. \u201cThis is something for investors to hang their hat on,\u201d he says, \u201cto give them confidence and say that there is a nascent legal framework.\u201d</p> <p>But Dr Gbenga Oduntan, a space law expert at the University of Kent, warns that the international community needs to get its act together quickly. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is a free-for-all over asteroids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to come together and do that thinking, because the law we have right now does not allow us to repatriate resources for commercial purposes.\u201d</p> <p>One way to do this, he suggests, is to draw on existing legislation such as the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>, which governs how nations use the ocean. Another option might be to revive the <a href=\"http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/intromoon-agreement.html\">Moon Treaty of 1979</a>, which deemed space to be the \u201ccommon heritage of mankind\u201d but failed to win support from any space-faring nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/13/congress-claims-space-resource-rights-for-americans-to-exploit-new-frontier\">American 'space pioneers' deserve asteroid rights, Congress says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such complex legal wrangles could indeed prove harder to overcome than other difficulties, such as the huge costs involved. But some experts believe that investing large amounts early on could create a space economy in which costs are forced down by collaboration.</p> <p>Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, London, says asteroid miners would most probably start off by mining water-ice, which can be broken down into hydrogen (for fuel) and oxygen (for supporting life).</p> <p>It is much cheaper to produce water in space than to take it there, and this process could generate revenue and technical support from other players in the space game. Once companies had that revenue stream under their belts, they could start thinking more seriously about the more costly business of extracting minerals and bringing them back to Earth.</p> <p>\u201cEventually you can imagine the whole process supporting itself,\u201d says Crawford. \u201cThe main hurdle is the initial investment, and it seems these companies think they can get started and jump over that hurdle.\u201d But he agrees that the more pressing concern is the legal picture, which \u201cbadly needs to be updated\u201d.</p> <p>Christopher Barnatt, professional futurist and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Next-Big-Thing-Printing/dp/1518749577\"><em>The Next Big Thing: From 3D Printing to Mining the Moon</em></a>, says history shows us that if governments such as Luxembourg\u2019s get behind asteroid mining, the space industry will deliver on its promise.</p> <p>\u201cWith the moon landings, the aspiration was way ahead of the technology. [President] Kennedy had spoken to Nasa and they\u2019d said it couldn\u2019t be done. He thought it could. We\u2019ve got evidence from throughout history that when we commit ourselves to a broad goal, we can achieve it.\u201d</p> <p>The ramifications could be huge, he believes, as progress in one technology spurs breakthroughs in another.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can use asteroids to make fuel, a lot of space exploration becomes cheaper. Then there\u2019s progress in robotics and artificial intelligence... it all starts to make things possible.\u201d</p>",
