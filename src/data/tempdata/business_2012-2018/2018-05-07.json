    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The proposed merger of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda puts too much power in the hands of large retailers and will have a damaging impact on the environment, regulators have been warned. Food campaigners, environmentalists and farmers\u2019 leaders are claiming the proposed deal, and the accompanying promise to further drive down prices, will put more pressure on producers, many of which may be forced to cut corners on environmental safeguards and shelve green initiatives. It comes as farmers face calls from the environment secretary, Michael Gove, to become stewards of the countryside, with any post-Brexit subsidy system focused on farmers contributing to a healthy and diverse environment. Dan Crossley of the Food Ethics Council said it was impossible to maintain pressure on farmers without having a negative long-term impact on the environment. \u201cToo much pressure on producers only increases the risk of shortcuts being taken, including environmental standards being lowered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also reduces the likelihood of producers being able to make important long-term investments to drive environmental improvements, like investing in renewable energy on farms.\u201d The National Farmers\u2019 Union said the environmental impact of the merger was one of its concerns. \u201cThe NFU will be examining the details of this proposed merger between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda carefully and the further concentration of retail power it creates within the food supply chain \u2026 The impact of the whole supply chain, all the way down to farm level, needs to be carefully assessed,\u201d said the NFU president, Minette Batters. Clare Oxborrow, a senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the merger could mean that two businesses \u2013 Tesco and a combined Sainsbury\u2019s/Asda \u2013 account for 60% of the grocery market. \u201cThe lure of lower food prices, particularly for shoppers on a budget, can seem attractive, but it hides the unpalatable truth that farmers will be under increased pressure to produce more but for less,\u201d she said. Oxborrow warned that if retailers demand \u201cever-tighter margins, something\u2019s got to give and the environment must not end up paying the price\u201d. \u201cRather than a deal of behemoths, we need diversity in our farms and high streets, with fairness across the supply chain,\u201d she said. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s said both brand names would be retained and there were no plans for store closures as a result of creating the group that would overtake Tesco to become the UK\u2019s largest retailer. Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said customers could expect a 10% reduction in the cost of popular foods. The Competition and Markets Authority has said it is likely to review Sainsbury\u2019s deal with Asda, but has declined to comment in advance of an inquiry opening. In the next few weeks, the regulator is expected to announce whether it will carry out a broad-brush \u201cphase 1\u201d review, which would last up to 40 days, or go straight to a more detailed \u201cphase 2\u201d, in which it would examine competition concerns at a local level around the UK in a process lasting up to 24 weeks. Campaigners say the environmental impact of the proposed merger and the wider concentration of power in the food retail sector should be considered. Crossley said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to promised price reductions. \u201cCheaper prices for customers are likely to be unaffordable for farmers, suppliers, farm animals and for the environment. At a time when we need to face up to climatic shocks and resource scarcity, we need a resilient food system \u2013 and the best route to resilience is diversity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Swiss-based food giant Nestl\u00e9 is paying Starbucks $7.15bn (\u00a35.3bn) for the rights to sell the US coffee chain\u2019s products around the world in a global alliance aimed at reinvigorating their coffee empires. The deal for a business with $2bn in sales reinforces Nestl\u00e9\u2019s position as the world\u2019s biggest coffee company, with brands such as Nescaf\u00e9 and Nespresso. The Seattle-based Starbucks, the world\u2019s biggest coffee chain, said it would use the proceeds to return money to shareholders by speeding up a share buyback programme. The transaction does not involve any Starbucks cafes and will involve selling Starbucks bagged coffee, drinks and Nespresso-style pods. The Nestl\u00e9 name will not appear on Starbucks products. \u201cWe do not want the consumer to perceive that Starbucks is now part of a bigger family,\u201d a Nestl\u00e9 source said. \u201cThis global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestl\u00e9,\u201d the Starbucks chief executive, Kevin Johnson, said. Nestl\u00e9 and Starbucks are joining forces in a highly fragmented consumer drinks category that has been involved in a string of deals lately. JAB Holding, the private investment firm of Europe\u2019s billionaire Reimann family, has fuelled the consolidation wave with a series of deals, including Douwe Egberts, Peet\u2019s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, narrowing the gap with Nestl\u00e9. Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks. A willingness to pay up for exotic beans and specialty drinks means companies can generate stronger profit margins than in mainstream packaged food. The Nestl\u00e9 source said it would pay market-linked royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee. It will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal but could step in to produce in markets where Starbucks is not present. \u201cNestle is far and away the largest hot drinks company globally, with more in sales than the next five largest hot drinks companies combined,\u201d Matthew Barry, an analyst at Euromonitor, said on Friday when the tie-up was first mooted. \u201cHowever, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership position is less secure than it once was.\u201d Other big players are growing as well, including Italy\u2019s Lavazza, which is the world\u2019s No 3.",

JAB Holding, the private investment firm of Europe\u2019s billionaire Reimann family, has fuelled the consolidation wave with a series of deals, including Douwe Egberts, Peet\u2019s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, narrowing the gap with Nestl\u00e9. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks. A willingness to pay up for exotic beans and specialty drinks means companies can generate stronger profit margins than in mainstream packaged food. </p> <p>The Nestl\u00e9 source said it would pay market-linked royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee. It will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal but could step in to produce in markets where Starbucks is not present.</p> <p>\u201cNestle is far and away the largest hot drinks company globally, with more in sales than the next five largest hot drinks companies combined,\u201d Matthew Barry, an analyst at Euromonitor, said on Friday when the tie-up was first mooted. \u201cHowever, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership position is less secure than it once was.\u201d</p> <p>Other big players are growing as well, including Italy\u2019s Lavazza, which is the world\u2019s No 3.</p>",
