It also encourages the development of non-fossil fuel alternatives, including solar and wind technologies, which become more economically feasible at higher oil prices.

The event shifted the spotlight onto the younger Balls. The 38-year-old is now emerging as one of the multimillionaire financiers pulling the levers at the heart of the eurozone crisis. So who is this master of the universe?</p> <p>Andrew Balls joined Pimco in 2006 from the Financial Times where he had been a US-based economics writer. The California-based company was influential, but it was about to become much more so. Gross may have got the bet on gilts wrong (plus another expensive mistake on US treasuries) but correct calls during the genesis of the financial crisis had helped his clients' assets balloon. As of 31 December 2011, Pimco managed $1.4tn (\u00a3880bn). To put that figure into perspective, it is the same amount as the gross domestic product of Spain.</p> <p>Countries raising debt, especially high-deficit European countries, desperately need investors to buy their bonds and Pimco has more investors than anybody else. It is within that financial behemoth that Balls has risen, quickly being sent from Pimco's Newport Beach base back home to Britain to lead the firm's European investment team. In effect, Balls has become the bond investor's point man in Europe just at the moment when the continent emerged as the world's biggest financial headache.</p> <p>Neither Pimco nor Balls have ever been eurozone bulls. Privately he is fond of bandying around frightening scenarios, such as the example of his employees in Germany whose payslips still show a \"10% solidarity tax\" dating back to reunification. Just imagine the popularity of an additional line that reads \"Greece\", his argument goes.</p> <p>He is bearish in public too, telling clients: \"One thing we know from past crises from around the world is if you can't get ahead of problems they spread. You see this in Europe spreading very clearly to the banking sector. But also the risk of broad loss of confidence in European markets \u2026 Can you have a happy ending to the European crisis? I don't think so \u2026 What is the probability that the policy response is going to fail? Unfortunately I think there is quite a risk there\".</p> <p>These anti-euro sentiments could have just as easily been uttered by Ed, who as Gordon Brown's closest adviser has been credited with doing more than anyone to keep Britain out of the single currency from 1997.</p> <p>In fact, the Balls brothers share many of the same views on issues such as the best way forward for the UK economy (\"If you can't grow, fiscal austerity is self-defeating,\" they say) which is not a surprise when you learn that the younger brother helps his elder sibling write political speeches.</p> <p>Despite being born almost seven years apart, the similarities between the two brothers extend to their education and early careers too. Both went to Nottingham High School, Oxford University and Harvard before pitching up at the FT. Still, their personalities and manner are different.</p> <p>Andrew Gowers, the former FT editor who worked with both, said: \"More than once I heard [Andrew] referred to as Ed's clever brother. He's a modest, cerebral guy, without the pointy elbows of his brother. More thoughtful. More of a markets guy. He always had a modest way of putting his views across. Both are super-clever. Ed is much more political. Andrew is more interested in finding the truth about economics and markets. Ed is always looking for the political angle. It is not at all surprising where they have both ended up.\"</p> <p>Andrew has \"ended up\" on Pimco's investment committee, a coterie chaired by Gross and made up of eight full-time members from Pimco's 2,038 employees. Balls is also a director of Pimco Europe, where the latest accounts show directors earning an average salary of \u00a38m each, sharing \u00a348m in 2010 \u2013 and with the highest earner taking \u00a325m. Balls only joined the board in October of that year, so would have been paid a small portion of the \u00a348m, but the numbers suggest he is by now a wealthy man. He certainly has the trappings, living in a posh house in St John's Wood, London, and his financial success is rumoured to have benefited Ed: friends say Andrew has given thousands to his big brother. Neither Andrew nor Ed would comment on the claims.</p> <p>But while the brothers can boast a long-standing anti-euro stance which now looks shrewd, both are open to criticisms that they called another \u2013 possibly more important \u2013 part of the crisis incorrectly.</p> <p>There are many who will never again quite trust Ed's economic crystal ball after he was so closely associated with New Labour's devotion to \"light-touch\" regulation of the City. Andrew was largely on that side of the debate too, lauding the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan who \u2013 along with former US Treasury secretaries Larry Summers and Hank Paulson \u2013 was one of the most influential pre-crisis voices resisting calls for regulation of financial derivatives.</p> <p>In December 2005, as Greenspan prepared to leave the Fed, Balls wrote an FT article describing him as a \"genius\"; explaining how the Fed had been \"strengthened during Mr Greenspan's long tenure\"; and stating how \"Greenspan has established a record of getting the big calls right\".</p> <p>Behind closed doors he still praises Greenspan, who also ended up becoming an adviser to Pimco, meaning Balls continued to see him regularly.</p> <p>To many who know him, the alliance seems odd. Daniel Bogler, a former managing editor of the FT, said: \"Andrew was mainstream at the FT. He very much believed that you shouldn't have unfettered free markets and capitalism. He seemed too left wing for what he is doing now \u2013 the straight free market stuff.\"</p> <p>Left wing, most probably. Pragmatic, certainly. As Gross himself told the FT last year: \"We try and get as much information as possible. We have people like Andrew Balls who likes to have lunch with central bankers \u2013 I don't think it's inside information if it's said at lunch and it's all above board.\"</p> <p>In that spirit, here is some internal information from Pimco.</p> <p>When the bond group was publicly trashing UK debt in 2010, insiders say there was one member of the investment committee arguing the view was wrong. His name? Andrew Balls.</p>",

You see this in Europe spreading very clearly to the banking sector. But also the risk of broad loss of confidence in European markets \u2026 Can you have a happy ending to the European crisis? I don't think so \u2026 What is the probability that the policy response is going to fail? Unfortunately I think there is quite a risk there\". These anti-euro sentiments could have just as easily been uttered by Ed, who as Gordon Brown's closest adviser has been credited with doing more than anyone to keep Britain out of the single currency from 1997. In fact, the Balls brothers share many of the same views on issues such as the best way forward for the UK economy (\"If you can't grow, fiscal austerity is self-defeating,\" they say) which is not a surprise when you learn that the younger brother helps his elder sibling write political speeches. Despite being born almost seven years apart, the similarities between the two brothers extend to their education and early careers too. Both went to Nottingham High School, Oxford University and Harvard before pitching up at the FT. Still, their personalities and manner are different. Andrew Gowers, the former FT editor who worked with both, said: \"More than once I heard [Andrew] referred to as Ed's clever brother. He's a modest, cerebral guy, without the pointy elbows of his brother. More thoughtful. More of a markets guy. He always had a modest way of putting his views across. Both are super-clever. Ed is much more political. Andrew is more interested in finding the truth about economics and markets. Ed is always looking for the political angle. It is not at all surprising where they have both ended up.\" Andrew has \"ended up\" on Pimco's investment committee, a coterie chaired by Gross and made up of eight full-time members from Pimco's 2,038 employees. Balls is also a director of Pimco Europe, where the latest accounts show directors earning an average salary of \u00a38m each, sharing \u00a348m in 2010 \u2013 and with the highest earner taking \u00a325m. Balls only joined the board in October of that year, so would have been paid a small portion of the \u00a348m, but the numbers suggest he is by now a wealthy man. He certainly has the trappings, living in a posh house in St John's Wood, London, and his financial success is rumoured to have benefited Ed: friends say Andrew has given thousands to his big brother. Neither Andrew nor Ed would comment on the claims. But while the brothers can boast a long-standing anti-euro stance which now looks shrewd, both are open to criticisms that they called another \u2013 possibly more important \u2013 part of the crisis incorrectly. There are many who will never again quite trust Ed's economic crystal ball after he was so closely associated with New Labour's devotion to \"light-touch\" regulation of the City. Andrew was largely on that side of the debate too, lauding the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan who \u2013 along with former US Treasury secretaries Larry Summers and Hank Paulson \u2013 was one of the most influential pre-crisis voices resisting calls for regulation of financial derivatives. In December 2005, as Greenspan prepared to leave the Fed, Balls wrote an FT article describing him as a \"genius\"; explaining how the Fed had been \"strengthened during Mr Greenspan's long tenure\"; and stating how \"Greenspan has established a record of getting the big calls right\". Behind closed doors he still praises Greenspan, who also ended up becoming an adviser to Pimco, meaning Balls continued to see him regularly. To many who know him, the alliance seems odd. Daniel Bogler, a former managing editor of the FT, said: \"Andrew was mainstream at the FT. He very much believed that you shouldn't have unfettered free markets and capitalism. He seemed too left wing for what he is doing now \u2013 the straight free market stuff.\" Left wing, most probably. Pragmatic, certainly. As Gross himself told the FT last year: \"We try and get as much information as possible. We have people like Andrew Balls who likes to have lunch with central bankers \u2013 I don't think it's inside information if it's said at lunch and it's all above board.\" In that spirit, here is some internal information from Pimco. When the bond group was publicly trashing UK debt in 2010, insiders say there was one member of the investment committee arguing the view was wrong. His name? Andrew Balls.",

Barclays on Friday confirmed it borrowed \u20ac8.2bn as major financial institutions across the continent took their borrowing from the European Central Bank's Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) to more than \u20ac1tn. Lloyds Banking Group was the largest borrower, drawing down \u20ac13.6bn from the ECB, while HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland borrowed the remaining \u20ac18bn between them. Some 800 financial institutions, more than a third of the 2,267 registered to borrow from the ECB, took part in the operation last Wednesday. There was surprise in some quarters that British banks took the opportunity to access the ECB's second three year lending facility, but all four of the UK's major have operations in the eurozone.

Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, previously a top adviser to German chancellor Angela Merkel, wrote to Draghi last month to express concerns about risks stemming from the strategy. Other ECB policymakers have similar qualms, saying it could fuel imbalances in the euro area and stoke inflation. The ECB move has allowed the eurozone three years to push through reforms to rigid labour markets and pension guarantees designed to stabilise economies ravaged by the financial crisis. Brussels has informed each member state that it must bring down its debt to GDP ratio each year by an agreed amount. Spain said earlier this week that it would miss debt targets set for 2012 and began to lobby for an easing of the levels set until 2015. Spain has taken centre stage in the eurocrisis after dramatic spending cuts by Italy's new technocratic government sliced the country's deficit. While several experts said the Italian austerity measures would cause the country crippling problems in subsequent years in terms of lost output and high unemployment, the policy won praise from the traders on the international debt markets. The Italian bond yield, which priovides a guide to the interest rate the government must pay and the risk it poses to lenders, dropped below Spain's for the first time since last August. Spain has struggled to bring its spending under control following a shift to regional government that has enhanced the power of local politicians. Madrid has conducted a guerilla war with several regions in an effort to clamp down on budget breaches. The newly elected right wing government of Mariano Rajoy is keen to liberalise restrictions on labour and offer tax breaks to small businesses, but knows these moves will take several years to show up in the output figures. Rajoy said Spain's deficit would be 5.8% of total economic output in 2012, higher than its agreed target of 4.4%. He said the higher target still represented \"significant austerity\". \"I'm backing austerity and aim to reduce the deficit from 8.5% [in 2011] to 5.8%,\" said Mr Rajoy. But the Netherlands also said it would miss its budget target for this year, with a deficit of 4.5%. The Dutch target was 4.1%. And Brussels will be keen to enforce its new rules on both countries. Greece could also miss deficit reduction targets for this year as its economy deteriorates and tax income tumbles.",

      "bodyText": "The \"bad bank\" owned by the UK taxpayer repossessed almost 9,000 homes last year, as profits shot up by 145%. UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), which is winding down the mortgage books of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, said repossessions rose to 8,847, up 10% on 2010. Richard Banks, the chief executive of UKAR, said: \"One is absolutely not happy with repossessing anyone's property. But it is not fair to the customer to create a situation where they are incurring more and more debt. It is also not in the benefit of the taxpayer. And it's not fair on the 90% of customers who are paying their mortgages on time.\" At the same time, underlying pre-tax profits more than doubled to \u00a31.1bn. The boost allowed UKAR to repay \u00a32.1bn of its government loan, although it still owes a whopping \u00a346.6bn to the UK taxpayer. Profits rose because of a sharp reduction in loans going bad. UKAR revealed a 14% decline in mortgages that were more than three months in arrears. That still represents some 5% of the group's mortgage book, compared with a national average of just under 2%. UKAR chief Banks admitted that arrears were likely to rise this year despite record low interest rates, which he expects to remain in place at least until the end of 2013. \"What benefits us is definitely a low interest rate environment. From my customers' point of view that is good news. But disposable incomes are under significant pressure, as a result of increases in fuel and food costs.\" He said unemployment was a concern, but the high proportion of young people out of work had less of an impact on UKAR's business, as they did not tend to be homeowners. Northern Rock Asset Management delivered a particularly stellar financial performance. Underlying pre-tax profits more than quadrupled to \u00a3790m. It repaid \u00a32bn to the government, bringing total repayments to \u00a33.1bn. B&amp;B, on the other hand, only started repayments this year, with an initial amount of \u00a3150m. The government raised the interest due on B&amp;B's loans from 1.5% to 5%. Northern Rock continues to pay 0.25% on its loan, but expects that to be increased at any moment. Banks said: \"Both [B&amp;B and Northern Rock] have sufficient capital to sustain an increase in the interest rates. The government is both the provider of loans and provider of equity, so it doesn't really matter if it gets it as an interest charge or repayment of equity.\" He said UKAR would pay back the majority of the loan within the next 10 years. He added that he would consider selling bundles of loans to speed up the process. Hedge funds and private equity groups have shown interest in buying them, he said, but no-one has offered a suitable price. UKFI \u2014 the body looking after the government's bank investments \u2014 recently said ownership of Northern Rock should generate a profit of between \u00a39bn and \u00a311bn for the government over the next 10 to 15 years. The announcement infuriated former investors in Northern Rock, who say the bank should never have been nationalised. A group of investors is appealing to the European court of human rights for compensation, after its claim was rebuffed by the high court. It is led by hedge fund manager Jon Wood, whose SRM Global fund bought an 11.5% stake in the bank for \u00a350m after its funding difficulties were revealed in 2007. Northern Rock was nationalised in 2008 after suffering the first run on a British bank in more than 100 years. It was split into a \"bad bank\", which took on the troubled mortgage portfolios, and a \"good bank\", which got the retail deposits, a mortgage book and 75 branches. The government sold the \"good bank\" to Virgin Money late last year, at an estimated loss of \u00a3400m. B&amp;B was also nationalised in 2008 and its branch network was sold to Santander.",

      "body": "<p>European leaders sought to prevent two years of financial crisis turning into a full-blown economic meltdown on Friday by redirecting their emphasis from crushing austerity packages to policies to boost growth.</p> <p>But the first EU summit since February 2010 not to be hijacked by the Greek debt drama and its threat to the single currency saw clashes between David Cameron and French president Nicolas Sarkozy over competing visions of how to secure growth.</p> <p>There was further wrangling over the eurozone's bailout fund for protecting the euro, and growing unease over the new eurozone fiscal pact aimed at forestalling a rerun of the debt crisis.</p> <p>The summit sought to square the circle of how to boost growth in an age of severe austerity packages that are beginning to hit the real economies of Europe in the form of soaring unemployment, shrinking GDP and lack of credit getting through to businesses and households.</p> <p>The stark reality of the challenges facing Europe's leaders was brought home by Spain's new prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, who told his counterparts that his budget deficit this year would be 5.8% rather than the 4.4% he is pledged to deliver.</p> <p>With the exception of David Cameron and his Czech counterpart, 25 of the 27 EU heads of government signed the new fiscal pact, a German-inspired international treaty aimed at resolving Europe's debt crisis by setting constitutional limits on national debt levels and budget deficits and empowering the European commission and the European court of justice to rule on the pact's compliance and levy hefty fines on fiscal sinners.</p> <p>It was clear that Spain will struggle to meet the binding targets while on Thursday it emerged that the Netherlands will also breach the new rulebook over the next three years unless it can make massive savings.</p> <p>While all agreed on the need for growth, the disputes were over the means to that end, with Britain the foremost advocate of a liberalisation drive opposed by an electioneering French president.</p> <p>After complaining on Thursday evening that no one in Europe was listening to him, David Cameron on Friday claimed that the summit had gone his way and that he had converted the rest of the EU leaders to his free market vision of deregulation and liberalising services.</p> <p>\"Today in Brussels we have made our voice heard.

      "bodyText": "European leaders sought to prevent two years of financial crisis turning into a full-blown economic meltdown on Friday by redirecting their emphasis from crushing austerity packages to policies to boost growth. But the first EU summit since February 2010 not to be hijacked by the Greek debt drama and its threat to the single currency saw clashes between David Cameron and French president Nicolas Sarkozy over competing visions of how to secure growth. There was further wrangling over the eurozone's bailout fund for protecting the euro, and growing unease over the new eurozone fiscal pact aimed at forestalling a rerun of the debt crisis. The summit sought to square the circle of how to boost growth in an age of severe austerity packages that are beginning to hit the real economies of Europe in the form of soaring unemployment, shrinking GDP and lack of credit getting through to businesses and households. The stark reality of the challenges facing Europe's leaders was brought home by Spain's new prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, who told his counterparts that his budget deficit this year would be 5.8% rather than the 4.4% he is pledged to deliver. With the exception of David Cameron and his Czech counterpart, 25 of the 27 EU heads of government signed the new fiscal pact, a German-inspired international treaty aimed at resolving Europe's debt crisis by setting constitutional limits on national debt levels and budget deficits and empowering the European commission and the European court of justice to rule on the pact's compliance and levy hefty fines on fiscal sinners. It was clear that Spain will struggle to meet the binding targets while on Thursday it emerged that the Netherlands will also breach the new rulebook over the next three years unless it can make massive savings. While all agreed on the need for growth, the disputes were over the means to that end, with Britain the foremost advocate of a liberalisation drive opposed by an electioneering French president. After complaining on Thursday evening that no one in Europe was listening to him, David Cameron on Friday claimed that the summit had gone his way and that he had converted the rest of the EU leaders to his free market vision of deregulation and liberalising services. \"Today in Brussels we have made our voice heard. The communique has been fundamentally rewritten in line with our demands,\" he said. \"Our letter really did become the agenda\" for the summit. That view was dismissed by other European officials as \"nonsense\". In the run-up to the summit Cameron enlisted the support of 11 other EU heads of government for a letter calling for a liberalising free market drive to boost growth in Europe. The signatories went beyond habitual UK allies on the issue in Scandinavia to include the new prime ministers of Italy and Spain. Downing Street sees the Italian and Spanish support as a coup. The UK-led drive was not explicitly supported by the EU's two biggest countries, Germany and France, however, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France gave short shrift to the British position. Germany and France could comfortably support much of the demands in the UK-drafted letter, said Sarkozy, before adding: \"The temptation of deregulation is ever-present with our British and Swedish friends and there we don't want to see that on the table.\" Cameron isolated Britain in December when he vetoed the move to entrench the new fiscal pact in European law, forcing the 25 to sign an international treaty. Sarkozy showered Cameron's summit letter with sarcasm. \"Usually if you write a letter signed by other friends, it is because it is important. You are either announcing that you are leaving or saying you love someone,\" he said. \"I take Mr Cameron's letter, after his decision not to join this latest treaty, as a sign that he doesn't want to get left behind, and I am delighted by that because we need the British in Europe.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the architect of the stiff new pact, hailed the signing as \"a milestone in the history of the European Union\". The treaty could yet run into trouble, however, since it has still to be ratified. The Irish have announced a referendum on the treaty while Francois Hollande, the French socialist tipped to become president in May, is threatening to re-open it. And the Dutch, grappling with a sudden budget crisis, are increasingly unhappy with the straitjacket limiting budget deficits to 3% of GDP. The country is forecast to run a deficit of 4.5% this year. Cameron also clashed with Merkel, officials said, over the firewall the eurozone is building to contain the debt crisis and prevent contagion from Greece. The eurozone said on Friday it would \"reassess\" the capacity of the \u20ac500bn (\u00a3416bn) bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, by the end of the month. Cameron urged the summit to commit to boosting the pot of money before meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington next month. Chancellor Merkel tetchily dismissed the demand from the prime minister, witnesses said. Courtesy of the trillion euros in cheap three-year loans that the European Central Bank has showered on EU banks in two months, leaders appeared confident that the Greek debt crisis was being contained. However there were more woes for Greece on Friday night when credit rating agency Moody's downgraded its sovereign rating from Ca to C, the lowest rating it gives, arguing that the risk of default remains high even if a bond-swap deal with banks and other private investors, due to be completed this month, is successful. It said it would \"re-assess the credit risk profile\" after Greece issues the new bonds. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's took similar action on 27 February. Ireland struggles The International Monetary Fund has cast doubt on whether Ireland would be able to return to international debt markets by next year. Dublin, which signed up to an \u20ac85bn EU and IMF bailout in late 2010, aims to return to long term debt markets later this year to help it prepare for the ending of official funding next year and borrow \u20ac20bn in 2014. The IMF, one of the country's troika of lenders along with EU institutions, said it Ireland could achieve the modest market financing planned for this year through selling short-term treasury bills. However it reiterated a call for extra European help to back Irish plans for a full return to bond markets next year for the first time since September 2010. It forecast only 0.5% growth for the country this year, as against the 1.3% Dublin expected. \"Whether the government manages to meet its financing needs next year will depend not only on continued strong policy implementation on its part, but also on developments in the euro area,\" the IMF mission chief for Ireland Craig Beaumont said in a statement accompanying the IMF's latest bailout report. \"Because of this uncertainty, the IMF is encouraging the European authorities to proactively take steps to reinforce the prospects of Ireland having adequate market access in 2013.\" Ireland's performance has been held up by European leaders as a glowing example of how their plans to fight the eurozone debt crisis are working and the IMF said once more that Dublin's policy implementation remained strong. However, with weaker exports and a larger than expected decline in consumption weighing on Ireland's economy, it said the challenges were greater than envisaged at the outset of the programme. This week Ireland said it would put the new European fiscal pact to a referendum. A rejection of the treaty would rule out any further bailout cash. The IMF said Ireland remained on target to reduce its budget deficit to 8.6% of GDP and again urged the government not to ramp up its austerity plans for this year, even if there is a further reduction in growth projections.",

      "body": "<p>Oil prices have surged by more than 12% since the start of the year to hit $125 a barrel and some analysts see them pushing even higher to $150.</p> <p>Already newspaper headlines are screaming out the news of record petrol prices in the UK and there are growing concerns about the latest headwind for a sluggish UK economy.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, UK and eurozone economist at Scotiabank in London, has sought to lay out how a jump in the oil price impacts on the UK. Here he gives Britons 10 reasons not to be cheerful about the oil price jump:</p> <p><strong>1. Higher petrol prices</strong>: Given the typical relationship between petrol prices on the forecourt and the price of crude oil, if the latter did move up to $150 a barrel, we could expect the price of petrol a litre to move up from around \u00a31.34 to over \u00a31.50 \u2013 a new record high by a significant margin. That is bad news for both inflation and consumer confidence.</p> <p><strong>2. Higher household energy bills</strong>: Gas and electricity prices typically take a steer from the price of oil. If oil rises sharply, it is more likely than not that household energy bills will rise at some point. Indeed, the price of gas traded in the wholesale market has risen by at least 10% over the period since oil has been surging.</p> <p>Timing is key. In continental Europe, particularly France, when oil prices move, household energy bills typically adjust very promptly. By contrast, in the UK, price hikes are unusual at the end of winter. This is because utility providers will get lots of bad press, but not much increase in profit margins as households switch off their central heating for summer. If, however, elevated oil prices persist until the autumn, then utility bill hikes at that point will become more likely.</p> <p><strong>3. Higher food prices</strong>: A fair proportion of the cost of food is distribution, fuel for farm vehicles and petro-chemicals. Furthermore, the emergence of bio-fuels means that higher oil prices has tended to exert upward pressure on agricultural commodity prices, since these can be used as a substitute for oil. Higher agricultural prices typically mean higher food prices in household shopping baskets.</p> <p><strong>4. Risk of persistently high inflation</strong>: All in all, we calculate that in a scenario where oil prices surge to $150 per barrel, CPI inflation in the UK would be at least 1% higher at the end of this year than we have assumed in our base case. That would mean inflation ends the year a little above 3% rather than the near 2% that we and most other forecasters assume.</p> <p><strong>5. The value of savings is eroded</strong>: If inflation out-paces interest rates, then it means the 'real' value of savings will fall. For example, with interest rates around 0.5% but inflation running at 4%, the real return on savings is falling.</p> <p><strong>6. High inflation makes it hard for the Bank of England to support economic growth through low interest rates</strong>: The Bank of England's target for CPI inflation is 2% year-on-year with a tolerance threshold of 1% either side of that. If inflation looks likely to persist above that level, then it is less likely that the Bank of England will support economic growth with further policy easing (i.e. quantitative easing) and might even have to raise interest rates more quickly than were it not for elevated oil prices.</p> <p>Having said that, the Bank does have some wiggle room. For example, inflation was close to 5% when the Bank engaged in the latest round of quantitative easing.</p> <p><strong>7. High street retailers suffer</strong>: Consumers don't have much choice about whether or not to pay for food or energy. They need to eat and they need to heat their homes. Hence increased expenditure on these as their prices rise leaves less spare cash to spend on 'fun stuff' i.e. discretionary goods such as TVs and clothing.</p> <p><strong>8. Inflation hurts economic growth</strong>: The causality between growth and inflation has run in reverse over the last year. High inflation has dampened growth. Conventional wisdom might have argued that weak growth would have led to slow inflation. The great hope for 2012 is that slowing inflation will help growth to resume an upward trajectory. More specifically, if inflation falls sharply it will reverse the squeeze on household spare cash, in turn helping to revive consumer spending. If oil rises to $150 a barrel we will probably still see a slowdown in inflation and a recovery in growth, though not quite as impressive as would have been the case with lower energy prices.</p> <p><strong>9. The government's austerity programme suffers</strong>: There are a number of channels through which higher oil prices will impact the public finances:</p> <p>a. The government will face a higher interest burden on the portion of the national debt that is linked to inflation;</p> <p>b. Slower economic growth will reduce tax receipts and could raise government outlays on unemployment benefits;</p> <p>c. The government may choose to increase winter fuel subsidies to the elderly against a backdrop of higher energy costs; and</p> <p>d. It is harder for the government to implement the planned increase in petrol duty given the risk of public backlash.</p> <p><strong>10. Fuel protests and disruptions:</strong> Public anger at the rising cost of fuel could provoke blockades and strikes. Panic buying and queues at petrol stations are not good for sentiment and overall business activity.</p>",

But manufacturers are another story. As British manufacturers found between 1988 and 1992 and then 2004 and 2008, a high currency value is a killer. More than any other factor, sterling at $2 was the cause of decline. Manufacturing accounted for more than 20% of the economy in 1997. By 2007, that share had declined to 12.4%. The sector employs 2.6 million people, compared with nearly 7 million at the end of the 1970s. The official figures changed the definition of manufacturing in that time, but the decline is still tangible. Labour policies were often blamed, but the age-old virility test that relies on a powerful and expensive currency was always a key culprit. Brazil's struggle with its currency, the real, if it persists, could also ruin its attempts to achieve a balanced economy that moves it away from a reliance on commodities and agriculture. Smith says the real is the chief target for currency speculators, keen to buy a good news story as a hedge against the ailing euro and yen. \"Understandably the authorities are getting uncomfortable with the pace of appreciation, especially given the slowing in the domestic economy,\" he says. The real was up 8.7% versus the dollar in the first two months of the year, but the total return was 10.3% once higher interest rates were taken into account. There is once again talk of \"currency wars\" from Brazil, which has imposed various measures designed to quell currency strength, such as taxing short-term foreign loans, and the finance minister has referred to \"perverse\" monetary policies of developed nations. The high currency has already played a part in bringing the economy to a standstill \u2013 it recorded 0% GDP growth in the third quarter of last year. \"But with global liquidity so ample it may be hard for Brazil to be that successful in its aim of keeping the currency contained,\" says Smith. \"Indeed, with a modest current account deficit, the country still needs to attract foreign capital, which is probably why it backed away from measures measure aimed at foreign direct investment. \"For the most part, Brazil may just have to live with currency strength that is largely driven by factors beyond its control\". No wonder the German government wants the euro to survive. There is the certain knowledge that it would be like Brazil with knobs on if the Deutschmark were still its currency.",
