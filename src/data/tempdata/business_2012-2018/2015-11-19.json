      "bodyText": "Why has it taken seven years for an official inquiry to reach the common sense verdict that the board and senior management of HBOS were ultimately to blame for the bank\u2019s failure? The short answer is that the HBOS board had a rival in the incompetence stakes in the form of the old Financial Services Authority. The regulator\u2019s post-crash probe into the conduct of bank\u2019s top individuals should have delivered a proper investigation back in 2009. Instead, the FSA \u2013 via a combination of timidity, confusion and overwork \u2013 flunked it. Andrew Green QC, reviewing the FSA\u2019s enforcement actions, used more legal language in his report but some of his revelations are astonishing. In March 2010, Green says, the FSA decided that the statutory threshold test for investigating former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby had been met, but the FSA nevertheless decided not to investigate him. Why? \u201cOn the basis of the available documents, it is not possible to determine who in fact took the decision, how it was taken, what were the factors taken into account, or for what precise reasons it was decided not to investigate,\u201d says Green. He calls the decision-making process \u201chighly unsatisfactory\u201d. He\u2019s being generous. The result in 2010 was that only the actions of Peter Cummings, head of corporate lending, were investigated, resulting in a \u00a3500,000 fine and a ban from the City. Cummings called it \u201ctokenism at its most sinister\u201d and one can now sympathise. The former trainee, who had worked his way through the ranks to become the so-called \u201cbanker to the stars,\u201d made grotesque errors but it was always hard to believe that his gilded bosses \u2013 notably chairman Lord Stevenson, former chief executive James Crosby, still a knight at the time, and Hornby \u2013 should not have faced fuller investigation. It smelled suspiciously like the financial establishment closing ranks. It is still too soon to reach that conclusion but we now know, thanks to Green\u2019s report, that the process that led to Cummings alone being investigated was \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d. That is why a fresh investigation into HBOS\u2019 bosses is the right outcome. Yes, it is late in the day. Yes, the new Prudential Regulation Authority, successor to the failed FSA, will take yet more time to assess whether the old standard of personal \u201cculpability\u201d \u2013 as opposed to the post-reform standard of \u201cresponsibility\u201d \u2013 has been met. And, yes, a ban from the City would feel a modest punishment for most of the individuals since many have left the industry; only the business secretary can pursue a ban from all company directorships. But the public interest, as Green put it, will be served by casting the net wider and re-examining the actions of at least 10 former HBOS officials. The principle of accountability has to be seen to applied even-handedly and competently. It never happened in 2009 and late is better then never. Meanwhile, the former non-executives of the bank, including Lord Stevenson, continue to complain that the PRA has downplayed \u201cthe unforeseen and unforeseeable effect of the financial crisis on HBOS.\u201d That plea looks less and less convincing as one re-reads the tale of the bank\u2019s catastrophe. Andrew Bailey, head of the PRA, was careful in his criticism. It was not that management failed to predict the global financial crisis. Rather, it was that HBOS\u2019 directors \u201cshould have put in place strategies that could in combination accommodate and respond to, in a timely way, changes in external circumstances.\u201d Stevenson &amp; Co may regard the distinction as fine but it is fundamental. HBOS was pursuing a strategy of chasing growth while failing to manage the inevitable risks. Its funding model, which relied on raising vast sums in wholesale markets, was inherently vulnerable in any downturn and, when crisis arrived, it was too late to change course. This, remember, was a bank that wasn\u2019t even in the riskier investment banking game.",

      "bodyText": "Former top managers of HBOS could be banned from working in the City after a damning report into the near collapse of the bank seven years ago laid the blame squarely on its former board and senior directors. At least 10 former executives \u2013 including chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby \u2013 could be subject to formal investigations after a decision not to pursue them before now was described as \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, has also been handed a copy of the report prepared by City regulators \u2013 to reconsider whether there are grounds to strike off any of the executives as directors of any type of business. Others who could face investigation include former finance chief Mike Ellis, who is now chairman of Skipton building society, Colin Matthew, who ran the international division of HBOS, and Lindsay Mackay, who ran the treasury operation. The report was seized upon by the chancellor, George Osborne, to justify sweeping changes to the regulatory regime and pin the blame on the Labour government\u2019s approach to overseeing banks in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. \u201cThis report, from one of our most respected regulators, clearly shows that the collapse of HBOS was caused by those running the bank and those regulating it. It demonstrates that the system of regulation created by the last Labour government failed,\u201d said Osborne. It is the second time an official investigation has laid blame for the near collapse of HBOS on its bosses. A previous parliamentary report said it was the result of a \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d. The much-delayed 400-page report into the collapse of the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution describes a boardroom that lacked banking experience and a management team which drove a culture of growth at all costs. The end result of the bank\u2019s ill-judged lending spree was that HBOS faced bad debts of \u00a345bn \u2013 significantly more than the \u00a338bn in losses racked up by the far larger Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank \u2013 which had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB and then bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 money during the height of the crisis \u2013 \u201cfailed to set an appropriate strategy, and also failed to challenge a flawed business model that placed inappropriate reliance on continuous growth without due regard to the risks involved\u201d. At one point in 2008, when HBOS was facing meltdown, it was reliant on a \u00a325bn Bank of England lifeline to stay in business. The now defunct City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, was also criticised, both for its approach to overseeing banks in the run-up to the crisis and for the way it decided to only punish one of HBOS executives, Peter Cummings, in the wake of its near collapse. But the report, first scheduled for publication two years ago and which cost \u00a37m to produce, concluded: \u201cUltimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with its board.\u201d It was published alongside a highly critical assessment of the FSA\u2019s decision to investigate only Cummings, who ran the corporate division, which also revealed there were grounds for an investigation into Hornby, now the chief operating officer of Gala Coral. There is no formal record of why the FSA targeted only on Cummings, who was banned and fined \u00a3500,000 in 2012. He complained of \u201ctokenism\u201d at the time. Andrew Green, the QC who conducted the review of the FSA\u2019s decisions, said it was plainly in the public interest that the decision not to investigate any other former HBOS bosses was reconsidered. A decision on whether to heed his advice has not yet been taken. Regulators will conduct a review into whether enforcement action should be taken \u201cas early as possible next year\u201d. The Green report quotes Clive Adamson, the former FSA director of enforcement, saying that \u201cthe people most culpable were let off\u201d. In his view those people were Hornby and Stevenson. While Green has left the door open for a wide investigation into former executives, he concludes that FSA was right not to investigate Crosby, who gave up his knighthood in 2013 along with 30% of his pension. Green\u2019s report also reveals a breakdown in communication between the City watchdog\u2019s enforcement division, then run by Margaret Cole, and its chief executive Sir Hector Sants, who was not told that there were grounds for a full investigation into Hornby. Sants\u2019 predecessors, chairman Sir Callum McCarthy and chief executive John Tiner, are also criticised for their approach in the run-up to 2008 crisis. \u201cThe FSA\u2019s approach was too trusting of firms\u2019 management and insufficiently challenging,\u201d the report said. The report acknowledges that the regulatory regime at the time was one of \u201clight touch\u201d and Andrew Bailey, head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, described HBOS and the FSA as \u201ccreatures of the time\u201d. \u201cHBOS was at root a simple bank that nonetheless managed to a create a big problem,\u201d Bailey said. He says the bank was not one that embarked on risky trading activities but overly focused on growth \u2013 which is denied by both Crosby and Hornby. Hornby refused to comment but his employer Gala Coral, the betting business, stood behind him. Skipton building society also backed Ellis, saying he had the \u201cwholehearted confidence of the board\u201d. In a statement issued by law firm Ashursts, eight former directors rejected the suggestion that an investigation into their conduct was warranted. The eight included Stevenson, who the report said bore \u201cresponsibility individually and, collectively and as board member for the failings of the board\u201d. The former directors said they \u201cdisagree with a number of the conclusions of this report, particularly the way in which it downplays the unforeseen and unforeseeable effect of the financial crisis on HBOS\u201d. But Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, urged the regulators to press on with investigations: \u201cBetter late than never \u2026 The FCA and PRA should get on with this immediately.\u201d He also called for further action on auditors KPMG, after the Financial Reporting Council, which polices the accountancy profession, said there were no grounds for an investigation. \u201cThe audit process was an important part of the story of HBOS\u2019s failure,\u201d said Tyrie.",

Too early, because many of the underlying weaknesses of the US economic system are still evident: the low rate of Americans\u2019 participation in the workforce; a lack of above-trend wage growth to drive up shop prices. Then there is the insipid global growth forecasts brought on by a decline in global trade. And too late because this is not the moment in the business cycle to cool spending \u2013 the traditional reason for deploying higher interest rates. Spending has already moderated. So the Fed needs to ask itself why, after six years of recovery, do businesses and households need it to intervene with higher borrowing costs if they are already restraining themselves from borrowing more. Without the European farce that followed the 2010 botched rescue of Greece, and the splurge in spending by the Chinese (that Beijing subsequently needed to calm this year with its own borrowing clampdown), US interest rates would already be 2%, not 0.25%. Reading the business cycle, the Fed\u2019s moment has passed. Even though the UK\u2019s recovery is no more than three years old, the Bank of England is in much the same position. That is not a universally held view. Goldman Sachs said in a long analysis this week of the global economy that the situation was relatively benign and the momentum in the US economy was set fair for several years more. It was certainly strong enough to withstand an interest rate rise or three, said its economists. the same applied to Britain. Meanwhile the prospect of further stimulus in the eurozone, while it should ultimately be positive for global growth, illustrates the ongoing weakness of the currency bloc. The European Central Bank has hinted that it may need to ease further in the minutes of its meeting in Malta earlier this month. ECB boss Mario Draghi is concerned he will fail to get inflation back to its target. Most significantly, businesses report new orders are slowing along with GDP. Dhaval Joshi, an economist at BCA Research, said the Fed could be misled by focusing on unemployment and wages. \u201cThe trouble is that unemployment is one of the most lagging indicators of the economy \u2013 a measure of what was happening 3-6 months ago, rather than what is happening now, or what will happen 3-6 months ahead. The clear and present danger is that although the lagging indicators are strong, the best leading indicators are all suggesting weakening growth ahead. \u201cSo, trapped by its own rhetoric and promises, the Fed risks making a policy mistake on December 16. When the market comes to realise that growth isn\u2019t fine, but interest rates are nevertheless rising, the view that Fed tightening is bullish could quickly evaporate, and indeed reverse,\u201d he said. A similar loss of confidence could undermine Draghi too, as investors begin to see him as a Wizard of Oz figure, madly pulling levers to very little effect. As Joshi said, the ECB can push interest rates further into negative territory, but not much more, \u201cbecause that could do more harm than good\u201d. Negative rates would squeeze profit margins in a still-fragile banking sector, or force banks to pass cuts on to savers, encouraging them to seek higher returns in riskier assets. \u201cMeanwhile, the average euro area five-year yield, at just 0.25%, is already within a whisker of a new all-time low. So realistically, the ECB is approaching the limit of what it can achieve with monetary policy. When investors come to realise this, any ECB-induced exuberance risks evaporating,\u201d he said. To some extent Brussels has recognised the problem and relaxed its austerity rules, allowing countries like Italy and Spain to boost spending. It is unlikely to be enough.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A US activist hedge fund has nearly doubled its stake in Rolls-Royce and is set to secure a seat on the aircraft engine maker\u2019s board. Major shareholders in Rolls-Royce are understood to have given their blessing to a representative from ValueAct joining the beleaguered group\u2019s board following a spate of profit warnings. The British manufacturer announced on Thursday that ValueAct had raised its stake from 5.4% to 10%, amid speculation that the fund is seeking a break-up of the business. Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East, who is four months into the job, has said he is happy with the overall shape of the company, which is dominated by its aviation unit, but it must be overhauled to adapt better to changing markets. As well a being a key player in the global aircraft engine industry, Rolls-Royce also makes marine engines and reactors for nuclear submarines - businesses that ValueAct would like to see hived off from aerospace. East is due to present an update on a strategic review on Tuesday next week. A spokesman for ValueAct declined to comment on the fund\u2019s purchase of additional shares in Rolls-Royce, while Rolls-Royce said the two were in touch. \u201cWe are in regular contact with ValueAct, as we are with all our major shareholders. We have a common interest in returning Rolls-Royce to profitable growth,\u201d said Rolls-Royce. After some reluctance over the summer, the Derby-based group has come round to the idea of offering boardroom representation to ValueAct , whose co-founder Jeffrey Ubben has played a role in some significant corporate shake-ups, including the exit of former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. According to Bloomberg, ValueAct has pressed for changes at 75 companies since Ubben launched the firm in 2000. However, before any boardroom change, Rolls-Royce is first keen to reassure itself that any person nominated by ValueAct can add to the board in terms of skills and experience. Rolls-Royce was also keen to get the backing of its shareholders for such a move, which it now seems close to getting. Shareholders have been consulted and any decision would require the support of at least 50% of investors. The larger shareholders in the company are Baillie Gifford with a 6% stake and Aberdeen Asset Management with more than 5%. Last week, Rolls-Royce issued its fourth profit warning in a year and hinted that it could cut dividend payments, sending its shares plummeting. It blamed falling demand for corporate jets in Brazil, China and south-east Asia, a decline in maintenance and servicing revenues from its engines for large planes, and slower demand from energy industry customers in the wake of the oil price slump - which has hit demand for products such as equipment for drilling rigs. East has held discussions with ValueAct, which were described as constructive and not confrontational. The activist investor is only permitted to take its stake as high as 15% under foreign ownership rules drawn up at the time of the company\u2019s privatisation in 1987. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbos, has been betting on strong sales for wide-bodied long-haul aircraft and says that by 2020 half the world\u2019s jumbo jets will be powered by its engines. However, the trend among leading airlines is towards narrow-body passenger planes, a market that Rolls-Royce abandoned in 2013 when it pulled out of a joint venture with rival Pratt &amp; Whitney so it could focus on wide-bodied aircraft and the next generation of single-aisle short-haul planes that should follow the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. East has vowed to bring costs down by up to \u00a3200m from 2017, on top of another planned amount, in an attempt to boost profitability. On top of this, the company faces bribery allegations and a Serious Fraud Office investigation. This week it brought in a leading law firm, Slaughter and May, to help it deal with the investigation, which was launched two years ago. Some analysts feel that the slump in the Rolls-Royce share price - it has fallen from around 12000p in 2014 to 541p - means the shares are now cheap. Others, such as Benjamin Fidler at Deutsche Bank, are predicting further falls as earnings become increasingly hard to predict.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Poundland have crashed after it reported falling first-half profits and sales and warned of \u201chighly volatile\u201d trading conditions in recent weeks. The discount retailer made a profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a39.3m in the six months to 27 September, down 26% from \u00a312.6m a year earlier. Total sales advanced 6.2% to \u00a3561.1m, while like for like sales \u2013 at stores open for at least a year \u2013 fell 2.8%. The company opened 57 stores in the UK and Ireland in the first half \u2013 with 30 in September alone \u2013 up from 34 in the same period last year. Poundland shares dropped 20% to 222.7p after the results announcement on Thursday. Jim McCarthy, the chief executive, said: \u201cOur Christmas range is our best ever. However, we have seen highly volatile trading conditions so far in the third quarter. The quarter\u2019s performance therefore depends more than ever upon the last six weeks\u2019 trading towards Christmas.\u201d The chain is digesting its acquisition of its single-price rival 99p Stores, which are being rebranded to Poundland \u2013 this means a 1p per item price rise for customers. After a lengthy competition inquiry, Poundland completed the \u00a355m deal in September, adding 250 branches of 99p stores to its 640 Poundland stores in the UK. It also has nearly 60 shops in Ireland and Spain, which trade as Dealz. It aims to have the vast majority of 99p Stores rebranded by April 2016, and said early sales from converted stores were encouraging. McCarthy said: \u201cThe 99p Stores acquisition is a transformational deal for us, adding the equivalent of five years of UK organic growth and 40% to our store numbers in one go. We\u2019re confident of achieving at least \u00a325m of incremental [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] from the acquisition and we are now increasing our UK and Ireland store target from 1,070 to 1,400 stores.\u201d Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cThe key thing was whether Poundland could revive City sentiment and its ailing share price by talking in detail about the strength of the 99p Stores synergies and the trading outlook.\u201d He added that even though McCarthy \u201cgives it a good go\u201d the fall in profits, dip in like-for-like sales and the volatile trading warning clearly did not thrill investors.",

We\u2019re confident of achieving at least \u00a325m of incremental [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] from the acquisition and we are now increasing our UK and Ireland store target from 1,070 to 1,400 stores.\u201d</p> <p>Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cThe key thing was whether Poundland could revive City sentiment and its ailing share price by talking in detail about the strength of the 99p Stores synergies and the trading outlook.\u201d </p> <p>He added that even though McCarthy \u201cgives it a good go\u201d the fall in profits, dip in like-for-like sales and the volatile trading warning clearly did not thrill investors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "May 2001 Halifax and Bank of Scotland merge to create HBOS, a \u201cnew force in banking\u201d. January 2004 Mike Ellis, the then finance director, tells the board the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is concerned the bank is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d. This subsequently emerges in the parliamentary commission on banking standards (PCBS) report in 2013. Late 2004 According to the PCBS, a so-called \u201cArrow\u201d review by the FSA found the risk profile of the bank had improved. December 2005 HBOS issues an upbeat trading statement. January 2006 James Crosby resigns as chief executive and Andy Hornby is named as his successor. January 2006 HBOS makes big push into the Republic of Ireland. June 2007 HBOS\u2019s share of new mortgage lending halves to 8%, its lowest level for seven years. Pricing errors are blamed. August 2007 Dividend raised by biggest amount since HBOS was created, as half-year profits rise by 13% to nearly \u00a33bn. February 2008 HBOS reports full-year profits for 2007 down 4% to \u00a35.4bn. March 2008 HBOS shares plunge in dramatic day on the stock market amid rumours about its financial health. City regulators launch an investigation into the share price movements. April 2008 The bank launches a \u00a34bn cash call to bolster its capital. Some investors question the need for the extra resources. \u201cOurs is a strategy for all weather, good or bad,\u201d chairman Lord Stevenson tells shareholders. July 2008 The rights issue flops, and the big City firms underwriting it are left with all but 8% of the shares. August 2008 Profits plunge 70% and HBOS warns house prices could tumble 18% in next 18 months. September 2008 Lehman Brothers collapses in the US and HBOS gets caught up in the turmoil. Lloyds TSB makes \u00a312bn takeover offer, which the FSA says would \u201cenhance finance stability\u201d. October 2008 Government announces bailout of the banking system. November 2008 Hornby, who had initially been sidelined in the rescue takeover, offered \u00a360,000 a month consultancy role with the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group, nicknamed the Bank for Britain. December 2008 Profits warning as bad debts in HBOS\u2019s corporate division hit \u00a33.3bn. January 2009 Deal with Lloyds completes. February 2009 Lord Stevenson, former chairman of HBOS, and Hornby apologise at the Treasury select committee. November 2009 Bank of England admits that HBOS was given a secret lifeline during the 2008 crisis, peaking at \u00a325.4bn on 13 December 2008, which was repaid on 16 January 2009. September 2010 Arrests made over allegations of fraud at HBOS in Reading. March 2012 FSA says the Bank of Scotland arm of HBOS committed \u201cvery serious misconduct\u201d in the run-up to the crisis and prioritised risk over prudence. September 2012 Peter Cummings, former head of HBOS\u2019s corporate arm, is fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from the City. He hits back, accusing the FSA of \u201ctokenism at its most sinister\u201d with regard to his punishment. Work on the FSA\u2019s wider report into the crisis at HBOS begins. March 2013 Treasury select committee appoints experts to review the FSA report. They are Stuart Bernau, former chairman of Chelsea building society, and Iain Cornish, former chief executive of Yorkshire building society. April 2013 Crosby, Hornby and Stevenson accused of \u201ccolossal failure\u201d of management by the PCBS. July 2013 The HBOS report had been scheduled to be published before the FSA was disbanded. However, at the last public meeting of the FSA, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey indicates the report will now be published at the end of 2013. July 2014 Andrew Green QC appointed to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the decision to take action against Cummings. July 2015 Bank of England reveals the HBOS report runs to 500 pages and that the investigation has received 1,425 representations from more than 35 individuals and their lawyers. November 2015 Bank of England publishes report, which lays the blame for the near-collapse of the bank on its board and management. It also criticises the FSA regulators.",

A reminder to calm the rhetoric: PMI has brought only two ISDS cases among over 600 reported cases, and we did not bring them lightly. The Uruguayan government knows that we prefer amicable resolutions to litigation and that we remain available for constructive discussion with authorities in Uruguay and elsewhere. Countries have executed more than 3,000 investment protection agreements. This reinforces the bedrock principle of international law that investors are entitled to fair and equitable treatment.

The Uruguayan government knows that we prefer amicable resolutions to litigation and that we remain available for constructive discussion with authorities in Uruguay and elsewhere.</p> <p>Countries have executed more than 3,000 investment protection agreements. This reinforces the bedrock principle of international law that investors are entitled to fair and equitable treatment. Governments that respect the rule of law have nothing to fear from the possibility of independent, objective review of regulatory measures.<br><strong>Marc Firestone</strong><br><em>Senior vice-president and general counsel, Philip Morris International</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s \u201chighly critical report\u201d suggests regulators are likely to hold senior former HBOS managers to account, says Charles Kuhn, Partner at law firm Hickman &amp; Rose. It brings them a step closer to prohibition proceedings against the top tier of HBOS management for the bank\u2019s liquidity failure. Up till now we have witnessed a prolonged exercise in targeting lower-level personnel in an attempt to appease an angry post-crisis public and gain some much-needed credibility. There have recently been rumblings from Whitehall that the \u2018reverse burden of proof\u2019 may be reinstated into the soon-to-be in force Senior Managers\u2019 Regime. But Kuhn argues against this... Despite this positive outcome we will continue to question the merits of trying to solve the problems of a deeply complex and flawed system by making it easier to prosecute former banking management.\u201d A spokeswoman from Skipton Building Society, where former HBOS finance director Mike Ellis is now chairman, said: Skipton appointed Mike Ellis as Chairman in May 2011 due to his significant and valuable experience of building societies, banks and regulation, and the personal qualities that have enabled him to lead the Board and work closely with the Executive team. Since his appointment Mike has provided outstanding leadership to the Board and overseen a significant improvement in the Society\u2019s performance during the intervening four years. He has the wholehearted confidence of the Board for the contribution he has made and continues to make to the Society. A quick reminder of the key points from today\u2019s report: The Bank of England had vowed to respond quickly to a new report into the collapse of HBOS. In a new probe, Andrew Green QC said regulators should consider if \u201cany former senior managers of HBOS should be the subject of an enforcement investigation with a view to prohibition proceedings\u201d. BoE deputy governor Andrew Bailey has promised \u2018rapid action\u2019, seven years after HBOS failed. Bailey also announced he has sent the report into the failure of HBOS to the secretary of state for business, who has powers to ban directors under Britain\u2019s Companies Act. He told reporters: \u201cThe directors\u2019 regime is entirely within their body of operation, not ours.\u201d Senior MP Andrew Tyrie, and the Institute of Directors, have both demanded an urgent response. However, the Department for Business has said that it has already decided to not ban HBOS directors, but might reassess the decision. Former HBOS directors have also defended themselves. They argue that the financial crisis could not be predicted The official report into HBOS was also released today, running to 400 pages . It found that senior managers had failed to set appropriate strategy, and ran a flawed business model. But it also chastised the former regulators....and the light-touch regulation pioneered by former PM Gordon Brown. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our full news story on the HBOS report: Eight former directors of HBOS are disputing today\u2019s report into the bank\u2019s failure. They\u2019re represented by Ashurst, an international law firm, which says there is no reason to take further action against anyone. Here\u2019s the full statement: The former non-executives directors of HBOS for whom Ashurst acts disagree with a number of the conclusions of this report, particularly the way in which it downplays the unforeseen and unforeseeable effect of the financial crisis on HBOS. Indeed the report acknowledges that its judgements have been reached with the benefit of hindsight. The report does not contain evidence that would justify any further enforcement action against executives. Equally, they understand the justified anger about what happened. The former Chairman and CEO resigned, apologised, waived contractual entitlements and lost their investments in HBOS. Their only wish now is that current and future bank boards learn to avoid the mistakes that they and others undoubtedly made. Those eight directors are: Sir Ron Garrick (former deputy chairman) Anthony Hobson (former chair of the audit committee) Lord Stevenson (former chairman) Sir Charles Dunstone, Coline McConville, John Mack, Kate Nealon &amp; Sir Brian Ivory (all former non-executive directors). They feature in our comprehensive list of former key players: The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills says it has already decided not to ban HBOS executives, two years ago. But it might take a second look at the situation, if today\u2019s reports have thrown up new evidence. Here\u2019s their statement: \u201cIn 2013 the Insolvency Service looked at whether the disqualification of the directors of HBOS was in the public interest and concluded there was not sufficient evidence to commence proceedings at that time. \u201cOnce the FCA and PRA have conducted their review into enforcement action, we will establish whether there is any new information to consider.\u201d Gala Coral, where Andy Hornby now works as chief operating officer, has issued a brief statement. It defends Hornby, while also avoiding commenting on the HBOS collapse: Andy Hornby has been a key member of Gala Coral Group\u2019s management team for nearly five years, most recently as COO. During this time he has played a central role in the transformation of the business and has earned the continuing support of our colleagues, management and shareholders. Gala Coral Group is not in a position to comment on events relating to another organisation and sector some eight years ago.\u201d The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, hasn\u2019t wasted any time blaming the former Labour government for contributing to HBOS\u2019s failure \u201cThis report, from one of our most respected regulators, clearly shows that the collapse of HBOS was caused by those running the bank and those regulating it. It demonstrates that the system of regulation created by the last Labour government failed. In the end, this led to a \u00a320 billion bailout of Lloyds Banking Group, funded by the taxpayer. (that\u2019s the \u2018light-tough\u2019 regulation cited in today\u2019s report) Osborne also claims that he has fixed some of the problems: \u201cI don\u2019t want the British taxpayer to be on the hook for any more bailouts. So since 2010 we have made big changes. We have dismantled the failed tri-partite system, and put the Bank of England back at the heart of financial supervision. \u201cWe have ensured that banks hold more capital and liquid assets, and that depositors are protected by a regulatory ring fence. And we have made bankers accountable for their actions, with those that bring down banks now facing up to seven years in prison. I welcome the fact that the report notes that this Government\u2019s steps have addressed many of the failings that led to the collapse of HBOS. Next spring we will complete the sale of Lloyds Banking Group, putting the bank back into the private sector - its rightful place.\u201d The Institute of Directors has urged regulators to pull their fingers out, and decide whether to open new investigations into former HBOS bosses. Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance Adviser at the IoD, says: \u201cThere is justifiable anger that, so far, only one HBOS executive has been reprimanded for his involvement in its failure. The regulators have plans for further investigations and it is in everyone\u2019s interest for these to be completed much quicker than the seven years we have waited for this one. That\u2019s the end of the press conference..... Nils Pratley gets the (crackly) microphone again: Q: Given the blunders which regulators made over HBOS, can we have any confidence in the FSA\u2019s report into Royal Bank of Scotland? Bailey declines to comment. Q: Could Andy Hornby and other senior HBOS officials now be disqualified as company directors? Bailey (joking that he\u2019s showing his age) says he remembers the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995, in which disqualification rules were exercised. This is a matter for the Department for Business, he explains. Q: Was the FSA under pressure from the Labour government to not ask for more tools, or to take more action against banks before the crisis? Bailey says there was a \u201cbroad culture\u201d of many years of economic growth, generally rising asset prices, bigger bank balances sheets. And crucially: There was a belief that this was a very good thing...don\u2019t kill the goose that laid the golden egg. That \u2018broad consensus\u2019 contributed to the banking crisis. And Bailey\u2019s priority is to create a new regulatory environment when this can\u2019t happen again. Isn\u2019t it staggering that it took so long to allow those criticised in the report to respond, asks our financial editor Nils Pratley. Is Maxwellisation* working as it should do? It\u2019s a good question, responds Charles Randell (a lawyer who serves on the Prudential Regulation Authority). But Maxwellisation wasn\u2019t the only reason that the report took so long. Randell also insists that powerful people were not allowed to water down the report. (* - Maxwellisation gives the \u2018right to reply\u2019 to anyone criticised in an official report) This press conference wouldn\u2019t pass a \u201cfit and proper\u201d test -- a problem with the microphones means Andrew Bailey is struggling to hear the questions. Q: What action could be taken against the people who were running the FSA when HBOS failed? Bailey says those people were not in \u201capproved roles\u201d at the time - and they\u2019ve now all left the regulator. But anyone who now works for the Prudential Regulatory Authority or the Financial Conduct Authority are subject to \u201ccontinuous\u201d tests to assess their fitness. Andrew Bailey also confirms that HBOS executives cannot now be fined, because today\u2019s reports took so long to be released. Q: How long will it take to decide whether to open enforcement procedures against former HBOS managers? Andrew Bailey says action will be taken ASAP. Q: Will it take months, or years? It will certainly be not more than months. Q: By the end of the year? That\u2019s barely a month, Bailey replies, effectively ruling out a decision in 2015. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, tells the press conference that \u201crapid action\u201d will be taken following today\u2019s reports. The HBOS case is an example of the perils of inadequate regulation, he adds. The Bank of England is holding a press conference to discuss the report - it is being streamed live here. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, explains how some HBOS executives could be feeling worried today: None of the big three at HBOS \u2013 former chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby \u2013 would wish to work for a bank again, and no lender would want to hire them. Stevenson concentrates on his charity gigs and Waterstones bookshops these days. Crosby gave up his gong and avoids the limelight. Hornby continued his executive career at Boots and now Coral, well away from the City. But, in some cases, a ban could have direct consequences. The surprise in Green\u2019s list of individuals that the FSA should have considered investigating is long. Apart from Stevenson and Hornby, it includes: Mike Ellis, former HBOS finance director, and now chairman of Skipton Building Society; and Lindsay Mackay, former head of the Treasury division and still an FCA-approved person. A further name, Colin Matthew, former head of HBOS\u2019 international division, is retired. Nils concludes that regulators could also face consequences... Those former HBOS managers named in the report will have reason to sweat today \u2013 but so will former senior FSA officials, most of whom can now be found in senior private sector posts. The report highlights how HBOS\u2019s aggressive mortgage lending accelerated ahead of its deposit base in the run-up to the crisis, leaving it unable to survive the credit crunch. HBOS was one of the biggest offenders, although Northern Rock (which hit trouble a year before HBOS) was even worse..... Andrew Tyrie MP, who chairs parliaments\u2019 Treasury Committee, has called for regulators to decide quickly whether any HBOS bosses should be sanctioned. He wants immediate action on Andrew Green QC\u2019s recommendation to \u201cconsider afresh whether any former members of HBOS\u2019s senior management should be subject to an investigation\u201d. Tyrie says: \u201cThe Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards asked the regulators to consider whether any former members of HBOS\u2019s senior management should be subject to investigation proceedings with a view to prohibition. At the request of Parliament\u2019s specialist advisers, the job of responding was passed to Andrew Green QC. We now have his clear answer. They should be. \u201cBetter late than never. What\u2019s more, Mr Green concludes that the FSA should have got on with this in 2009. And he has come to this view, not with the advantage of hindsight, but by basing his conclusions on the material available to the FSA at that time. \u201cThe FCA and PRA should get on with this immediately. Parliament will expect an answer from them within months, not years. This has gone on long enough, to put it mildly. A pithy summary, from Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon: The regulatory structure put in place by the last Labour government contributed to the crisis, says the report. It is now clear that the FSA\u2019s pre-crisis approach to prudential supervision was not appropriate for the purpose of meeting its market confidence objective. However, the FSA was responsible for a broad range of financial regulation issues and was expected to regulate within established global standards. There was also a sustained political emphasis on the need for the FSA to be \u2018light touch\u2019 in its approach and mindful of the United Kingdom\u2019s competitive position. The report lays out the key reasons why HBOS\u2019s risky lending and flawed strategy meant it was survive the financial crisis: Its Board failed to instil a culture within the firm that balanced risk and return appropriately, and lacked sufficient experience and knowledge of banking. The result was a flawed and unbalanced strategy and a business model with inherent vulnerabilities arising from an excessive focus on market share, asset growth and short-term profitability. This approach permitted the firm\u2019s executive management to pursue rapid and uncontrolled growth of the Group\u2019s balance sheet, and led to an over-exposure to highly cyclical commercial real estate (CRE) at the peak of the economic cycle, lower quality lending, sizable exposures to entrepreneurs, increased leverage, and high and increasing reliance on wholesale funding. The risks involved were either not identified or, where identified, not fully understood by the firm. There was a failure by the Board and control functions to challenge effectively executive management in pursuing this course or to ensure adequate mitigating actions. HBOS\u2019s underlying balance sheet weaknesses made the Group extremely vulnerable to market shocks and ultimately failure as the crisis of the financial system intensified. There was an extended period of inflows of capital to developed economies, resulting in low yields, declining awareness of risk and asset price bubbles, in which market discipline \u2013 investors, analysts, rating agencies and other third parties \u2013 failed to constrain firms from undertaking risky strategies. An overall systemic crisis in which the banks in worse relative positions were extremely vulnerable to failure. HBOS was one such bank. And that was exacerbated by the regulator\u2019s own failings. The report doesn\u2019t spare the regulators\u2019 blushes either. It says that the Financial Services Authority had identified the key risks which HBOS faced -- but had then failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate these risks effectively. This shows \u201cdeficiencies in the FSA\u2019s prevailing approach to the supervision of systemically important firms\u201d, says the report. Supervisors need to employ their judgement and take appropriate actions in response where necessary. A particular challenge is to intervene sufficiently early when a firm is apparently successful but supervisors can identify weaknesses that are sufficiently important to pose a threat to the firm that is inconsistent with the objectives of supervision. HBOS was such a firm The report has no time for the suggestion that HBOS was simply unlucky -- sunk by a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis. Its top managers should have been better prepared, it says: The management of a firm is not required to have perfect foresight. The criticism in the Report is not that management failed to predict that there would be a global financial crisis. Rather, they should have put in place strategies that could in combination accommodate and respond to, in a timely way, changes in external circumstances. The paradox of the HBOS story is that the bank was generally seen as a success, until close to its collapse, says the BoE\u2019s Andrew Bailey: The 2001 merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland had yielded double-digit profit growth in all but one of the years up to end-2006 and analysts\u2019 and brokers\u2019 views were positive at least until early 2007. But, by this time, the seeds of the firm\u2019s destruction had already been sown as a flawed strategy led to a business model that was excessively vulnerable to an economic downturn and a dislocation in wholesale funding markets. The 400-page report is online here: The failure of HBOS plc (HBOS) And the inquiry into why only one executive was sanctioned (so far....) is here: Report into the FSA\u2019s enforcement actions following the failure of HBOS Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, says HBOS simply didn\u2019t understand what it was getting into. And that left taxpayers on the hook for a \u00a320bn bailout when its risky lending unravelled. Introducing today\u2019s reports, Bailey says: \u201cThe story of the failure of HBOS is important both to provide a record of an event which required a major contribution by the public purse, and because it is a story of the failure of a bank that did not undertake complicated activity or so-called racy investment banking. HBOS was at root a simple bank that nonetheless managed to create a big problem.\u201d Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s early news story, which she\u2019ll be adding to through the afternoon: The former regulator, the Financial Services Authority, has also been criticised. The report founds that: Flaws in the FSA\u2019s supervisory approach meant it did not appreciate the full extent of the risks HBOS was running and was not in a position to intervene before it was too late. The FSA was wound up after the 2010 General Election, amid criticism that it had failed to spot that Britain\u2019s banks were running dangerous risks, and too reliant on borrowing in the wholesale money market (which dried up in the 2007 credit crunch) The HBOS review has also concluded that \u201cultimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with the Board and senior management\u201d. It says that: they failed to set an appropriate strategy for the firm\u2019s business and failed to challenge a flawed business model which placed inappropriate reliance on continuous growth without due regard to risks involved. Our City editor Jill Treanor has spent the morning digesting the report. She is tweeting that those bankers running HBOS before the crash could now be investigated, and potentially banned from the City. The reports are out! And they are recommending that regulators should consider bringing fresh charges against those responsible for the failure of HBOS. The Bank of England says: As part of the Review, Andrew Green QC was asked to provide an independent assessment of whether the decisions taken on enforcement by the former regulator, the FSA, were reasonable. The PRA and FCA are therefore also today publishing Andrew Green QC\u2019s report into the FSA\u2019s enforcement actions following the failure of HBOS. In his report, Andrew Green QC recommends that the PRA and FCA should now consider whether any former senior managers of HBOS should be the subject of an enforcement investigation with a view to prohibition proceedings. The PRA and FCA will conclude a review as to whether further enforcement action should be taken as early as possible next year. (That\u2019s the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority) More to follow! Here\u2019s a fateful photo from September 2008, showing HBOS CEO Andy Hornby alongside Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank. Blank had just decided to take the plunge and rescue HBOS, urged by prime minister Gordon Brown. A month later, Brown was signing off on a \u00a320bn rescue package for Lloyds/HBOS, as the true scale of its problems became clear. You can get up to speed on the HBOS affair, and relive the financial crisis, with this timeline: We\u2019re actually getting two reports today. As well as the main inquiry into the collapse of HBOS, a top lawyer has examined why only one executive - director Peter Cummings - was ever sanctioned over the crisis. Andrew Green QC\u2019s report could potentially open up the prospect of fresh action being taken against other top bosses. Cummings ran HBOS\u2019s corporate lending division. He was fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from the City by the FSA. Cummings has argued it was unfair to single him out for the failings at HBOS. The collapse of HBOS was one of the most dramatic events in the wild autumn of 2008, when the failure of Lehman Brothers triggered global panic. Like Royal Bank of Scotland (which was also bailed out), HBOS epitomised the boom that grew in the UK financial sector at the start of the decade. Created by the merger of a solid Scottish bank and the respectable Halifax building society, HBOS was determined to become a new force in banking. With disastrous results, when its risky lending turned sour in 2008. In 2013, MPs blamed HBOS\u2019s decision to pursue \u201caggressive, asset-led growth across divisions over a sustained period\u201d, which meant it took on more risk across the group. The official investigation into the collapse of HBOS in 2008 is about to be released. At noon precisely, Britain\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will issue their report on the bank\u2019s 2008 collapse. It will outline how and why HBOS, created by a merger of Bank of Scotland and Halifax, was brought down by the financial crisis - and only saved by a merger with Lloyds. This report has been many years in the making - delayed as those facing criticism were allowed to respond, under Britain\u2019s controversial Maxwellisation rules. Ex-bosses such as CEOs Andy Hornby and James Crosby, and chairman Lord Stevenson, could face heavy criticism. But regulators at the defunct Financial Services Authority could also be singled out, for not stepping in to prevent reckless lending. And the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG, may not escape the spotlight either -- Sky News reckons the report will show that HBOS managers pushed it to sign off lower bad loan provisions in a bid to reduce concerns about its financial health..... Back in Greece, Syriza MP Gabriel Sakellaridis has quit rather than support the government in tonight\u2019s austerity vote (as explained in earlier post). This is a blow to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government, as it struggles to implement its unpopular third bailout. Tonight\u2019s vote includes new measures to repossess houses from Greeks who cannot meet their mortgage repayments. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that tensions are rising. Insiders are now speaking of a \u201cmini government crisis.\u201d Gavriel Sakellarides\u2019 resignation is all the more poignant for the fact that he was the former government spokesman and a very close ally of Tsipras. \u201cIt is impossible for me to contribute to the realisation of government policy,\u201d the leftist wrote in his resignation requesting that Tsipras initiate the process to replace him. The prospect of thousands losing their homes, as a result of the new foreclosure bill, is believed to have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for Sakellarides. Sakellarides is ironically a member of the group of 53, the faction of intellectual dissidents lead by the finance minister Euclid Tsakolotos. Helena adds that ANEL, Tsipras\u2019s junior coalition partners, are the \u2018wild card\u2019 in tonight\u2019s vote - they\u2019re not happy about raising the tax on wine. European stock markets have hit levels last seen before China\u2019s Black Monday crash in August. This morning\u2019s rally has pushed the Stoxx 600 index of leading European shares up by 1.1%, to a three month high. This reflects the Federal Reserve\u2019s confidence in the US economy, and its guidance that future interest rate moves will all depend on economic data: Alvin Tax, FX strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale bank, says (via Reuters) \u201cWe have had an interesting FOMC minutes and risk assets have rallied across the board with the dollar weaker and EM [emerging market assets] leading the way.\u201d \u201cThat is the success of the Fed really. We expect they will hike in December but then proceed slowly after that and that has soothed markets.\u201d WorldFirst\u2019s Jeremy Cook is first to react to the weak UK retail sales report: \u201cRetail sales in October are always a strange one \u2013 unable to benefit from the \u2018back to school\u2019 rush and unlikely to see too many Christmas shoppers and hence can see a slight slip in expenditure. This year is no different given September\u2019s number was boosted by strong spending around the Rugby World Cup and warm weather and we have seen a natural pause on the nation\u2019s High Streets before the manic festive season begins.\u201d Just in - UK retail sales declined month-on-month in October, even though shops continue to cut prices. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail sales volumes shrank by 0.6% compared with September, while the amount spend fell by 0.7%. Food, textiles and clothing were the biggest drag on sales, the ONS says. That suggests consumers may be cutting back ahead of Christmas, with the unusually warm autumn meaning less demand for warm clothes. The report also shows that prices have been steadily declining in recent months, pulling down the cost of living. The European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist is dropping a strong hint that monetary policy will indeed be eased next month. Peter Praet is telling an audience in Frankfurt that downside risks are prevailing in the eurozone, with price pressures subdued and investment still depressed. Praet also suggests that the \u2018zero lower bound\u2019 could be lower than previously thought. That means that banks could be hit with steeper negative interest rates, to spur them to lend to businesses and consumers, rather than leave money at the ECB. We\u2019re just seeing reports that a Greek government MP has been ordered to resign, after saying he wouldn\u2019t support the austerity measures being voted on tonight. If Gavriil Sakellaridis steps down, he could be replaced by a new Syriza candidate. Nothing is ever easy in Greece, when bailout funds are involved. And over in Athens, the government is racing to tweak its latest austerity plan after some MPs protested against raising the tax on (gulp) wine. This measures was agreed this week to unlock \u20ac10bn of bank recapitalisation funds and \u20ac2m loans. Greece\u2019s socialist-led government decided to hit wine guzzlers, after backtracking on a plan to tax private education. The Kathimerini newspaper says: According to sources, the new proposal is likely to propose a smaller tax on wine (of 0.15 euros rather than the 0.30 euros originally mooted) along with another measure to cover the difference. MPs will vote on the measures tonight. Tensions are already quite heightened in Athens - yesterday, farmers clashed with riot police in a protest against austerity. It feels like a December US interest rate hike is in the bag. Which means investors can move on to pondering other things, like the eurozone. The ECB could well ease monetary policy next month -- boosting its QE programme, and hitting banks with more negative interest rate to force them to lend. But there\u2019s some uncertainty over how bold Draghi and co will be, as Jeremy Cook of Worldfirst explains: It is becoming clear that the most important Central bank meeting in December is not that of the Federal Reserve but instead the European Central Bank on December 3rd. Even then we are having difficulty pricing expectations; while traders are pricing in a 10bps cut in the deposit rate with 100% certainty and a 20bps cut to about a 50% certainty there is no real way of pricing in increases in quantitative easing. Mining stocks are helping to drive European markets higher this morning. In London, Glencore (+3%) and BHP Billiton (+2.6%) are among the top risers, pushing the FTSE 100 up over 1%. Last night\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes, showing growing confidence in the US economy, are having an effect, as Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Markets are clearly liking the US central bank\u2019s faith in US economic recovery and belief in a gentle \u2018testing of the water\u2019 first move towards policy normalisation, whilst peers are doing the exact opposite, will not derail economic recovery or deliver market mayhem. Just that little bit more certainty goes a long way. Good news for anyone who took part in Royal Mail\u2019s flotation in 2013 -- shares are up 4.5% this morning. The company reported that its UK cost savings programme had accelerated this year (that\u2019s City-speak for getting rid of more posties). Rapid cost-cutting has taken investors\u2019 minds off a 30% drop in profits in the last six months. Royal Mail is another company desperate for a decent Christmas. But it also faces several threats. Analyst Mike Dennis of Cantor FitzGerald has listed a few risks: Demand for parcels and mail in the UK and Europe, pricing and cost pressures, upcoming union negotiations on wages and productivity, higher cash pension costs and regulatory risk with an on-going review of the UK mail market by the regulator Ofcom. Poundland has been relegated to the bargain bin this morning, after the discount retailer\u2019s latest results failed to impress. Shares in Poundland have slumped by 14%, after it reported a 26% drop in underlying profits and warned that trading is currently \u2018highly volatile\u2019. The company is currently digesting its acquisition of 99p Stores, which are now being rebranded under the Poundland livery (very inflationary!). That\u2019s had a short-term impact on profitability. It had previously guided the market that profits would pick up towards the end of 2015, so talk of volatile trading is a worry, with Christmas closing in fast.... A solid start to trading in Europe has seen the FTSE 100 rise by 0.5%, or 32 points, to 6311. The German DAX is up almost 1%, with France\u2019s CAC gaining 0.7%. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga confirms that traders are encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s belief that America can shoulder higher interest rates. Markets received further confidence following the highly anticipated FOMC minutes release that the Federal Reserve will finally begin to raise US interest rates in December. The comment that \u201cit may well become appropriate\u201d to raise US interest rates in December installed confidence among investors, especially considering that this meeting took place before the exceedingly impressive employment report released at the beginning of this month. Asian stock markets have jumped overnight, as expectations grow that the US central bank is ready to raise interest rates. Shares rallied in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney after the minutes of last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting showed that most policymaker believe the US economy could handle higher borrowing costs from December. And that\u2019s likely to feed through to Europe this morning too. The rally was sparked by the minutes of October\u2019s Fed meeting. It showed that just \u201ca couple\u201d of members had raised concerns that raising rates in December could be premature. Investors have been enjoying record low interest rates, so you might expect a rate hike to hit shares. But the old adage that \u201cmarkets hate uncertainty\u201d also comes into play. Also, traders are anticipating that the Fed will be eager to emphasise that it will be cautious about any subsequent rate hikes, meaning monetary policy will stay quite loose for a while. Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets, says: \u201cIf - when - they lift rates in December, the Fed will likely be very aggressive in highlighting the idea of a very gradual pace.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. If a week is a long time in politics, then seven years is an absurdly lengthy stretch in finance. But that\u2019s how long we\u2019ve been waiting to discover exactly why one of Britain\u2019s leading banks, HBOS, collapsed in 2008. The official report into the failure of HBOS comes out at noon today, followed by a press conference. Over 500 pages, it will explain how the bank was brought down in the financial crisis, prompting a rescue merger with Lloyds. A separate report will also examine why only one executive ever faced sanctions. Former HBOS chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and the bank\u2019s former chairman Lord Stevenson, have all avoided charges. The regulator at the time, the Financial Services Authority, is also likely to feel the heat after allowing HBOS to lend aggressively, and end up in a position where it couldn\u2019t survive the crash. Our City editor Jill Treanor sets the scene: Former HBOS executives will learn whether they face fresh investigations into their conduct in the run up to the bank\u2019s near collapse in 2008. Thursday\u2019s publication of the much-delayed and long-anticipated report into what went wrong at the bank will be published alongside an opinion commissioned by the regulators into the decision in 2012 to only punish one former executive. There were reports that the review will say there are grounds to reconsider the scope of the original investigation and that the regulators will assess whether to embark on a fresh wave of investigations. Individuals are not expected to be singled out.... What else is afoot? We get the latest UK retail sales figures, at 9.30am GMT. They\u2019re expected to show a fall in takings on the high street, Investors are digesting the minutes from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent meeting, released last night. They show that many policymakers are ready to hike rates next month. Overnight, the Bank of Japan has left monetary policy unchanged, despite Japan dropping back into recession in the last quarter. The Greek parliament should vote through new budget measures tonight, to unlock its next aid payment. And in the City, Royal Mail and Poundland are both reporting results. Royal Mail has posted a 30% drop in profits, and revealed that 3,000 staff have left the business in the last six months. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The risks involved were either not identified or, where identified, not fully understood by the firm. <br></li> <li>There was a failure by the Board and control functions to challenge effectively executive management in pursuing this course or to ensure adequate mitigating actions. <br></li> <li>HBOS\u2019s underlying balance sheet weaknesses made the Group extremely vulnerable to market shocks and ultimately failure as the crisis of the financial system intensified. <br></li> <li>There was an extended period of inflows of capital to developed economies, resulting in low yields, declining awareness of risk and asset price bubbles, in which market discipline \u2013 investors, analysts, rating agencies and other third parties \u2013 failed to constrain firms from undertaking risky strategies. <br></li> <li>An overall systemic crisis in which the banks in worse relative positions were extremely vulnerable to failure.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares reached a near two week high, as markets continued to recover after the volatility following the attacks in Paris. The FTSE 100 finished up 50.96 points at 6329.93, its best level since November 6. Central banks were one of the causes for the investor enthusiasm. The Bank of Japan left interest rates on hold overnight, while later the European Central Bank\u2019s latest minutes added to the belief that further stimulus measures could be sanctioned in December. Earlier the US Federal Reserve hinted that rates may rise across the Atlantic, but this spooked markets less than expected. For a start it has effectively removed much of the uncertainty of recent weeks about what the Fed may be planning, and at the same time it suggests the US central bank believes the country\u2019s economy is strong enough to withstand dearer borrowing costs. And the feeling now is that a rate rise in December would not necessarily mean a string of further increases immediately. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: It appears that the message from the Fed is becoming clearer: rates will rise but will \u201cnormalise\u201d at a lower level than previously expected. That\u2019s good for equity investors but not great for savers and investors in bonds or cash. The biggest riser in the FTSE 100 was Johnson Matthey. The the technology group and platinum specialist jumped 237p or almost 10% to \u00a326.94 after it said it would return \u00a3305m to shareholders as a special dividend, representing 150p a share. The move comes following the sale of its gold and silver refining and research chemicals businesses. The company - which had been caught up in the fallout from the VW emissions scandal since it makes catalytic convertors - also reported a 4% dip in half year profits to \u00a3208.3m. It said the full year outlook was in line with expectations. Other companies also benefited from positive updates. Royal Mail rose 22.5p to 476.7p following its figures while building materials group CRH climbed 97p to \u00a318.75 as it said it expected strong growth in the US and recent acquisitions should lead to an increase in full year earnings of around 25%. Nine month earnings rose 34%. Mining shares benefited from hopes of a stronger global economy in the wake of the Fed minutes, with Rio Tinto rising 29.5p to \u00a322.90. BHP Billiton was 8p better at 888.7p after it said keeping a strong balance sheet would be a priority and it would update shareholders on its dividend - which investors fear could be under pressure - in February. Elsewhere catering group Compass climbed 19p to \u00a310.75 after better than expected figures from peer Sodexo. But housebuilders came under pressure after a disappointing update from Bovis Homes, down 85p at 904p. Persimmon fell 25p to \u00a318.40 while Taylor Wimpey lost 0.4p to 185.3p. A number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend. Vodafone fell 2.5p to 221.5p and Imperial Tobacco lost 78p to \u00a334.92. Among the mid-caps Poundland plunged 20% to 222.7p after a 26% fall in first half profits and a warning of volatile trading conditions. But Qinetiq climbed 24.4p to 260.1p as the defence technology group issued a postive trading update and announced a \u00a350m share buyback. Lower down the market, financial services group Walker Crips jumped 12.5% to 47.25p after half year revenues rose 22% to \u00a313.3m, with pretax profit up five-fold to \u00a3589,000, despite difficult markets and a rise in regulatory costs. Barker Poland Asset Management made a first time contribution after its acquisition in March this year, and chairman David Gelber said: \u201cWe continue to increase the proportion of our revenues earned as fees, rather than through transaction driven commissions.\u201d On Aim, Orosur Mining added 20% to 6.75p after investor meetings with the chief executive of the South America-focused gold specialist. Finally, Frontier IP rose 10% to 21.25p as the group, which specialises in commercialising intellectual property, reported a jump in full year profits from \u00a327,000 to \u00a3647,000.",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail profits fall as redundancy payouts increase costs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail profits fell 30% in the first half of the year as the privatised company was hit by growing competition and the redundancy costs of shedding nearly 3,000 jobs. The business, which was floated on the stock market two years ago, said its full-year performance would depend on the Christmas period \u2013 its busiest time of year. Revenues slipped to \u00a34.4bn in the six months to 27 September from \u00a34.48bn a year earlier, with falling UK letter revenues largely offset by growth in domestic and European parcels. Nearly 3,000 staff left, mainly through voluntary redundancy, pushing up Royal Mail\u2019s costs in the short-term. This represented about 2% of the company\u2019s UK workforce, which is 140,000 after the cuts. This resulted in transformation costs doubling to \u00a394m, and pushed pretax profits down to \u00a3116m from \u00a3167m. Adjusted operating profits excluding those costs slipped to \u00a3342m from \u00a3348m, in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts. The firm has stepped up its cost savings programme and expects operating costs to fall at least 1% over the year as a whole. Royal Mail shares rose about 5% to close at 476p. The company increased its interim dividend from 6.7p to 7p. Chief executive Moya Greene said Royal Mail had delivered a \u201cresilient performance\u201d. She added: \u201cWe delivered parcel volume and revenue growth in the UK, which continues to be a challenging market \u2026 As in previous years, the full-year outcome will be dependent on our important Christmas period, for which we have extensive preparations in place.\u201d Greene, who joined the group in July 2010, said: \u201cI love what I am doing. \u201cThe IPO was a very, very large deal. It is really wonderful that we turned this beautiful, treasured heritage company into an investable institution.\u201d She said that the IPO \u201ccaused us to sharpen our strategy and to articulate where we were going and to set in place a roadmap so that we had everybody on the same page.\u201d Letter volumes in the UK fell 4% while parcel volumes rose 4%. The European parcel delivery division GLS did better, delivering 9% volume growth. Royal Mail faces rising competition from companies such as Amazon which is pushing into the parcel delivery market with its own network. Other delivery firms are also struggling. UK Mail, which has been dogged by problems at its new automated delivery centre, warned that profits would be lower next year and cut its dividend after reporting a sharp fall in first-half profits on Wednesday. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cRoyal Mail now has a stranglehold over letter (including Christmas card) deliveries since its main competitor Whistl quit the market, but parcels are where the money is. The boom in e-commerce and strong UK consumer confidence has brought about fierce competition between delivery companies. To date, Royal Mail has struggled in the fight for our online orders.\u201d A review from Britain\u2019s postal regulator Ofcom, following a complaint from Whistl, also looms large. In its initial view, Ofcom said Royal Mail had breached competition law by proposing wholesale prices that are more expensive for any firm looking to run a rival mail delivery service. A final decision is expected next year. The government sold its remaining 14% stake in Royal Mail a month ago, raising \u00a3591m for the Treasury. The firm\u2019s flotation in October 2013 was highly controversial because the government sold 60% of the 500-year-old institution for 330p a share, only to see the price rise sharply to 615p. A committee of MPs said taxpayers lost out on up to \u00a31bn because the shares could have been priced higher. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \u201cThis is the expectedly difficult half of the year for Royal Mail, with these numbers putting even more emphasis than usual on the critical Christmas period ... The spectre of the Ofcom review remains a drag on prospects, whilst the ominous presence of Amazon also injects caution. More positively, the fact that the company is accelerating the transformation should be reflected further down the line in a leaner business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The \u201cunicorns\u201d are still alive! Just. The share sale of mobile payment company Square got off to a good start on Thursday \u2013 but only after the Silicon Valley startup was forced to slash the price of its offer. Square, one of the Silicon Valley \u201cunicorn\u201d startups \u2013 companies valued at billions of dollars despite an absence of profits \u2013 began trading on Thursday morning on the New York stock exchange. The sale has been seen as a key test for unicorns including Airbnb, Snapchat and Uber, which have raised billions in private financing that they will one day need to repay via share sales. Square sold at an opening price well below its own projected range \u2013 $9 a share, rather than the $11-$13 the company had hoped for. But by 10.30am the company\u2019s shares had jumped to over $12 and ended the day at over $13. Founder and CEO Jack Dorsey celebrated his birthday on the NYSE with his mother, Marcia Dorsey, who rang the bell with her son and Cheri Mims, a flower-seller who uses Square in her business. To christen the IPO, Square-using businesses gathered on a stretch of Broad Street between Wall Street and Exchange Place, with band Junior Prom providing music. Dorsey, also the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, rang the opening bell at 9.30am, broadcasting his trip to the stock exchange on Twitter\u2019s live video service, Periscope. Last year Square was valued at over $6bn and its $9 a share offer valued the company at less than half that. The first-day share rise saved face for Dorsey, who has come under intense pressure from investors who are skeptical that he can run both companies, especially as Twitter struggles to find new users. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson, on Union Square Ventures, has been bearish about the market in so-called unicorn startups. But on Thursday morning, Wilson came out swinging in defense of Square\u2019s IPO price cut, saying: \u201cJack Dorsey did the right thing at Square.\u201d \u201cSometimes you just need to get the deal done,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen you are burning through cash and need to finance your company, the terms might suck, but the cash doesn\u2019t. So you do the deal and live to fight another day.\u201d",

The latest snapshot of factory order books and output from the CBI also showed companies expected output to fall over the coming three months \u2013 despite it having picked up in recent weeks, the business group reported. The poll of 458 companies echoes other reports of manufacturers curbing investment and production as a downturn in China and other export markets knocks demand.

While exports have come under pressure in recent months, the picture for UK demand has been more mixed. One recent survey suggested manufacturers enjoyed a recovery in output and new orders last month. In the CBI poll, there were more companies reporting a rise in output in the three months to November than those reporting a drop. But looking ahead, more firms expected a fall than a rise in output in the next three months. The survey found 20% of manufacturers believed the level of their order books was above normal, while 32% said it was below normal. The rounded balance of -11% was a small improvement on -18% in October\u2019s poll. But focusing on export order books, 11% of firms said they were above average, while 40% said they were below, a balance of -29% \u2013 the lowest level since January 2013. Newton-Smith reiterated calls on George Osborne not to cut back government support for exports and innovation in his spending review next week, when the chancellor will set out tighter budgets for government departments. \u201cFurthermore, we would caution against the introduction of additional business costs that could hamper the competitiveness of UK manufacturers at home,\u201d she added.",

      "bodyText": "Bovis Homes shares slumped after the housebuilder warned annual profit margins would be hit by planning delays and rising costs caused by labour shortages. The company\u2019s shares dived 11% in early trading on Thursday and are now 8% lower at 909.5p, dragging down other housebuilders Persimmon, Berkeley, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey. The trading statement from Bovis coincided with official figures that showed a small recovery in the number of houses built in recent months, but there was also evidence of worsening labour shortages across the sector, while materials shortages have eased. Bovis said the number of homes built this year would rise more than 8% from last year, while the average sales price is up 7%. Buyers have reserved 1,650 homes for next year, 18% more than at this stage last year. But investors took fright as Bovis said it expected its operating profit margin for 2015 to be only marginally ahead of last year\u2019s 17%. It blamed delays in planning decisions on a number of high profit-margin sites, as well as shortages of skilled tradesmen which have held back building and pushed up wages, although it added that this cost inflation was showing signs of moderating. Official figures showed on Thursday that 34,250 houses were started in England in the three months to September, up 2% from the second quarter and from a year earlier. This reversed some of the dip in activity seen in the second quarter. Terrie Alafat, director of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an increase in the number of homes being built, but today\u2019s figures show that we have a long way to go. We have failed to build the number of homes we need for decades \u2013 the result is a housing crisis in which millions of people are struggling to access a decent home at a price they can afford. \u201cAnd the fact remains that during the year to September we only managed to build 135,050 houses \u2013 that\u2019s just over half the number we need every year to keep up with our growing population and start tackling the shortfall that has built up over the years.\u201d Hansen Lu, property economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith labour shortages worsening and unemployment already close to a record low, a rapid acceleration in housing starts appears to be unlikely in the near term.\u201d He noted that materials shortages, at least, appeared to be easing. The proportion of builders reporting materials availability as a major constraint on production fell in the latest quarter, and has fallen from 64% to 22% over the last year. However, labour shortages have been worsening. The proportion of builders reporting labour costs as a major constraint ticked up from 33% to 36% during the third quarter, while for labour availability, this rose from 49% to 60% \u2013 the second highest reading on record.",

Ladbrokes issued a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, urging shareholders to vote for the merger at a meeting on 24 November. The gaming group described the strategic rationale and benefits of the proposed merger as compelling and said it was confident shareholders would back the deal. Desmond, in his criticism of the merger, pointed out that Ladbrokes shares had fallen since news of the deal was announced in July. Ladbrokes sources believe the share price decline, from 130p to 109p, can be largely explained by investor worries over possible intervention from the Competition and Markets Authority, which is investigating key aspects of a merger. The CMA is not expected to rule on the deal before mid-2016. Ladbrokes says the deal will give it the potential to deliver faster online growth; create the largest licensed betting estate; help create a large international portfolio of businesses; deliver big cost savings; and give the group the ability to operate across an enhanced technology platform. Desmond, who owns about 3% of Ladbrokes shares and recently became a commercial partner, believes the benefits of any deal will accrue to Gala Coral. He wants Ladbrokes shareholders to press the group to set up an independent board, which would be advised by an independent investment bank, on future options for the group. Desmond, an Irish billionaire, said Ladbrokes\u2019 chairman, Peter Erskine, and chairman designate, John Kelly, have \u201cled Ladbrokes down the disastrous path to a deal that is [in effect] the death of Ladbrokes as an independent company\u201d.",

The company said Paul Doughty - who only joined in June - has resigned and will step down at the end of the year. His predecessor Sean Wilkins stepped down suddenly in January. Until it finds a replacement chief executive David Wild will be also be responsible for the company\u2019s finance activities. But the news has not upset the company\u2019s shares. They are up 19p at \u00a311.11 after it repeated that it had seen a strong performance in the third quarter, the new quarter had started well and it was comfortable with the market\u2019s full year expectations. At the time of Doughty\u2019s appointment the company said he brought \u201ca wealth of experience from a leading consumer brand in the technology and FTSE 250 listed enviroment.\u201d Doughty was previously with Moneysupermarket.com, and broker Peel Hunt said the company now says the move was not right for him.

There may be different reasons for the two departures but Paul\u2019s exit is bound to raise concerns about the working environment at executive level. Given this, the board has no room for error with regard to the next chief financial officer. Perhaps the ideal scenario would be an internal appointment but we believe this is unlikely. But despite the new uncertainty, Batram kept his add recommendation: Paul\u2019s departure is not a positive in terms of executive team stability. However, these things happen. Furthermore, we have been impressed with the performance of the business and the strengthening of the relationships with franchisees under David Wild\u2019s tenure...The underlying performance of the business remains strong, we see the room for upgrades not just in 2015 but beyond. The rating is not cheap but the delivery remains impressive and furthermore, Domino\u2019s Pizza doesn\u2019t have the living wage distractions of others in the sector.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retail sales slumped in October despite shops slashing prices to entice bargain hunters. The Office for National Statistics said on Thursday the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.6% on the previous month, slightly more than analysts had expected. However, there was a City consensus that consumers were \u201ctaking a breather\u201d before the festive shopping season, and the underlying situation was still one of healthy growth. The ONS emphasised the point with figures for the last three months on the previous quarter that showed growth for the 23rd consecutive month, increasing by 0.9%. Sales volumes were running 3.8% higher than a year ago, it said. Over the past year, food and fuel have taken the biggest toll on sales after a 3.6% decline in fuel sales and a 1.5% fall in food. Household goods stores reported a 3.1% rise in sales from October last year, but only after a 2.3% cut in prices. Clothing recorded a 2.3% rise in sales over the same period after prices were kept flat. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThe decline needs to be looked at in light of the 1.7% sales surge seen in September, leaving the three months growth rate \u2013 a good indicator of the underlying sales trend \u2013 showing a healthy 0.9% rate of increase. \u201cFurther spending growth is likely in the coming months, for the short-term at least. The longer-term outlook is more uncertain, being dependent on trends in inflation, wages and interest rates.\u201d The prospect of millions of households receiving letters in a month informing them of tax credit cuts may also play a part in dampening consumer demand going into the new year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency dealer World First, said: \u201cRetail sales in October are always a strange one \u2013 unable to benefit from the \u2018back to school\u2019 rush and unlikely to see too many Christmas shoppers and hence can see a slight slip in expenditure. \u201cThis year is no different, given September\u2019s number was boosted by strong spending around the Rugby World Cup and warm weather, and we have seen a natural pause on the nation\u2019s high streets before the manic festive season begins.\u201d",

The FTSE 100 is up 65.05 points at 6344.02, with analysts pointing out that markets have hated the recent uncertainty over US rates, so any signs of a decision would be welcomed. The Bank of Japan keeping its rates on hold has also given some support. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEx said: After months of wishy-washy, non-committal statements from Yellen and co., the market-dragging uncertainty that has dominated periods of 2015 appears to be dissipating. Of course, markets being as fickle as they are there could soon be a switch in sentiment and a return of rate-hike fearing investors. However, for now the positive trading coming out of the US is lifting the markets as a whole. Johnson Matthey is leading the way, up 181p or more than 7% to \u00a326.38 after the technology group and platinum specialist said it would return \u00a3305m to shareholders as a special dividend, representing 150p a share. The move comes after it sold its gold and silver refining and research chemicals businesses. The company - which had been caught up in the fallout from the VW emissions scandal since it makes catalytic convertors - also reported a 4% dip in half year profits to \u00a3208.3m. It said the full year outlook was in line with expectations. It expected diesel cars to be \u201can important part of the mix\u201d going forward despite the VW scandal, and said it expected a number of petrol cars would need advanced filter technology to meet new standards. It forecast \u201caverage sales value per vehicle to approximately double for those engines requiring additional particulate control.\u201d Analysts at Jefferies said the statement was reassuring: Johnson Matthey is confident it has the technologies to meet new legislation. Tightening of emissions requirements should continue to present opportunity for the catalyst providers, in our view. MIning shares were among the risers, partly on the basis that if the Fed raises rates it must be confident about the outlook for the global economy. Meanwhile BHP Billiton is 24.1p better at 904.8p after it said keeping a strong balance sheet would be a priority and it would update shareholders on its dividend - which investors fear could be under pressure - in February. The company faced protestors at its annual meeting after the recent dam disaster in Brazil. Elsewhere Royal Mail has risen 26.7p to 480.9p after its results, while Compass has climbed 29p to \u00a310.85 after better than expected figures from peer Sodexo. But Bovis Homes has disappointed with its figures, down 84.5p at 904.5p which has undermined the rest of the sector. Persimmon has fallen 21p to \u00a318.44, Berkeley Homes has lost 33p to \u00a331.06 and Taylor Wimpey is 0.6p lowre at 185.1p. Among the mid-caps Poundland has plunged nearly 19% to 226.2p after a 26% fall in first half profits and a warning of volatile trading conditions. But Qinetiq has added 19.4p to 255.1p as the defence technology group issued a postive trading update and announced a \u00a350m share buyback. Lower down the market, financial services group Walker Crips has jumped nearly 13% to 46.875p, its biggest one day rise for more than three years after half year revenues rose 22% to \u00a313.3m, with pretax profit up five-fold to \u00a3589,000, despite difficult markets and a rise in regulatory costs. Barker Poland Asset Management made a first time contribution after its acquisition in March this year, and chairman David Gelber said: \u201cWe continue to increase the proportion of our revenues earned as fees, rather than through transaction driven commissions.\u201d The interim dividend has been lifted by 9%, and Gelber promised increasing payouts \u201cas we look to the future with growing confidence.\u201d",

Instead, those who work in NatWest and RBS branches as well as those who work in customer service in call centres are being given pay rises intended to compensate them for the loss of bonus potential. Union officials urged other financial institutions to follow the move by the 74% taxpayer-owned bank, which like rivals has been embroiled in the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. Rob MacGregor, Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, said: \u201cUnite has long campaigned to end the hard sell in retail banking and here we see RBS moving away from sales target-based bonuses, resulting in a pay rise for the majority of retail staff. It is time for other banks to follow suit and end the hard sell.\u201d Bonuses for retail staff do not reach the levels of those working in other divisions of the bank and amount to about \u00a32,000. The move to end bonuses follows an announcement by RBS chief executive Ross McEwan in 2014 to end teaser rates on products such as credit cards in an attempt to become more customer-centric. Among the changes is the scrapping of 0% balance transfer deals on credit cards. Staff were told about the changes to their pay on Wednesday by Les Matheson, head of retail and business banking for RBS and NatWest. \u201cNo other big bank has done this,\u201d Matheson said. The sales and bonus culture in banks was highlighted by a \u00a328m fine on Lloyds Banking Group in 2013, after one employee was found to have been so desperate to ensure he did not get demoted or miss out on his bonus that he sold himself one of the financial services products.",

      "bodyText": "Many women are just as ambitious as men when they begin their careers, but become so wearied by fighting against multiple structural and experiential barriers to their success that this ambition often wanes. This is one of the findings made by Michelle Ryan, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Exeter in the UK, in her research into why women are under-represented in leadership roles and report lower ambition. Ryan has returned to Australia to deliver a lecture on Thursday evening at the Australian National University in Canberra, where she graduated with a PhD in psychology in 2004. \u201cIf you do surveys and about the proportion of men and women aiming for the top, you can see differences in their levels of ambition,\u201d Ryan told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut they don\u2019t start off that way. We\u2019ve done the surveys for numerous professions, and whether it\u2019s police officers, surgical trainees, or women in science, men and women have absolutely equal levels of ambition and want to make it to top in equal numbers. \u201cBut while men\u2019s ambition increases over time, women\u2019s decreases. My research suggests that this drop is not associated with wanting to have kids, or to stay home and look after them. It\u2019s related to not having support, mentors or role models to make it to the top, and the subtle biases against women that lead to their choices.\u201d Ryan said she considered mentors to women as being senior people in the workplace who actively sponsored, endorsed and promoted them, while role models were people in leadership positions women looked up to, but who they did not necessarily know personally. Without both kinds of support, it was an uphill battle for women seeking promotion, Ryan said. \u201cWe often put the ownership on women, telling them to lean in and speak up, but if the workplace culture isn\u2019t supportive or appreciative it\u2019s an uphill battle,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou can only try this for so long, and it\u2019s these sorts of women who try but aren\u2019t supported who often, over time, become less ambitious, or who leave and start their own businesses, because they get tired of the fight within the organisation.\u201d Ryan\u2019s previous research, which coined the term for a phenomenon called \u201cthe glass cliff\u201d, was named by the New York Times as one of the top 100 ideas that shaped 2008. The research found that women often only broke through the glass ceiling and received a promotion at FTSE 100 companies when the company was on the verge of failing. \u201cI made this discovery after reading a front page news story in the UK that said women in leadership roles were causing their companies to perform badly, and the article recommended that women probably shouldn\u2019t take on leadership positions,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we looked at the basic data, and showed that women were often appointed to boards after a company performed badly, was failing, or suffered a major drop in share price. If you want to be less charitable, you can say this was because women were being made scapegoats.\u201d More recently, stories in the media were misleading people into believing women who were not ambitious had made a choice not to be, Ryan said. Her research had found the truth was more complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the context in which those choices are being made,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to say women are agentic beings, but to say it\u2019s all a free choice not constrained by context and certain conditions placed on them is not always correct.\u201d She advised ambitious women to find a sponsor in the workplace who supported their career. Often this was a senior man, because there were not enough women in senior roles. Senior men with daughters of an age where they were entering the workforce tended to be more supportive of women\u2019s careers, she said. \u201cThe other bit of advice is to be resilient in the face of the uphill battle, to be aware of the unconscious biases and the lack of support, and not internalise it by saying \u2018it\u2019s because I\u2019m not good enough\u2019,\u201d Ryan said.",

      "bodyText": "Former HBOS executives will learn whether they face fresh investigations into their conduct in the run up to the bank\u2019s near collapse in 2008. Thursday\u2019s publication of the much-delayed and long-anticipated report into what went wrong at the bank will be published alongside an opinion commissioned by the regulators into the decision in 2012 to only punish one former executive. There were reports that the review will say there are grounds to reconsider the scope of the original investigation and that the regulators will assess whether to embark on a fresh wave of investigations. Individuals are not expected to be singled out. Peter Cummings, the former head of commercial arm of HBOS, is the only bank executive to have been censured over the affair. He was investigated by the now defunct Financial Services Authority (FSA) following the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in September 2008 and the subsequent \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout of the enlarged bank. Cummings was fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from the City in September 2012. He accused the regulator of \u201ctokenism\u201d when the fine was handed out, and argued it was \u201cinherently unfair\u201d that he was only the only individual facing disciplinary action. That decision has been the subject of a review by Alan Green QC, who has been asked to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the FSA\u2019s decision, and whether \u201cthe regulators should consider afresh whether any other former members of HBOS\u2019s senior management should be subject to an investigation with a view to prohibition proceedings\u201d. Green\u2019s review is being published alongside an offcial report, which runs to at least 500 pages and was first scheduled for publication in 2013 \u2013 when the FSA will still in existence. It is being published by the FSA\u2019s successor bodies: the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. Its publication comes two years after a parliamentary commission accused former HBOS chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and the bank\u2019s former chairman Lord Stevenson, of a \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d. That report, by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, also criticised the FSA \u2013 which was disbanded in 2013 \u2013 for a series of regulatory failures. In addition to Cummings, the FSA also censured the Bank of Scotland arm of HBOS for not have having risk controls that could keep up with its pace of growth in the face of a deteriorating economy. One of the key findings of the censure in 2012 was that \u201cthe culture of optimism impeded the effective management of transactions as they became stressed\u201d. It also said that the bank had been told by auditors KPMG that it would be prudent to start setting aside far bigger provisions to cover looming bad debts. At the time of its takeover by Lloyds, HBOS operated a federated structure with six divisions. Each division had its own chief executive, who had autonomy in managing their businesses. Crosby was group chief executive until 2006 when Hornby took over after running the high-street operations. Hornby\u2019s current employer, Gala Coral, is expected to back him when the report is published. While Hornby did not receive a payoff, executive members of the board received payments worth around \u00a31m in total through \u201cchange of control\u201d clauses in their contracts which paid out through the Lloyds takeover. They have also amassed pension pots which will pay out when they retire - although in 2013 Crosby gave back 30% of his \u00a3580,000-a-year pension and his knighthood. If new investigations do lead any enforcement action, the former executives will not face financial penalties. This is because fines cannot be imposed for any wrongdoing unless there is significant new information as regulators needed to warn executives of enforcement action before a six-year statute of limitations ran out last year. Regulators have dealt with more than 1,500 representations from 35 individuals in a process known as Maxwellisation, which requires individuals in the report to see information about themselves.",

    "webTitle": "Record low wage growth is a blow to the government's case for tax reform | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest release of the wage price index saw yet another record low rate of wages growth. In the private sector, wages in the past 12 months grew throughout Australia by just 2.1% on average. The figures are yet another blow to the critics within the government of the current industrial relations system and also rather dampen the case made by the treasurer and prime minister that tax reform needs to urgently tackle \u201cbracket creep\u201d. Since before it came into being, critics of the Fair Work Act have claimed it puts the unions back in charge and that it is an example of the \u201cpendulum swinging\u201d too far in favour of the workers, as opposed to some theoretical perfect middle in which employees and employers are equally favoured. Joe Hockey in his final speech in parliament gave the rusty saw another turn when he suggested, \u201cYes, Work Choices did go a little too far, and the fairness test was too late. But I am afraid Labor went too far the other way, and we have a structural imbalance in our workplace relations system that costs Australians jobs \u2013 and better-paying jobs at that.\u201d It\u2019s a view that has not become any more correct the more times it is repeated, and it is one which suffers a blow whenever the latest wages price index data is released. In the past 12 months, wages in the private sector grew by a record low 2.1%; in the public sector they grew by 2.7% (just up from the record low of last quarter) and combined average wages grew by 2.3% \u2013 also a record low: I feel almost some degree of sadness that Senator Eric Abetz is no longer minister for employment, because I always delight in repeating his claim from 2011 that, \u201cThe Coalition is concerned that we will see huge levels of wages growth across Australia if action is not taken to ensure sustainable pay increases.\u201d No one with any sense is worrying about a wages breakout now. Wages in the private sector for the past three quarters have grown by just 0.5% \u2013 which would be a record but for one quarter during the global financial crisis: And we know no one with any sense is worrying about wages or the lack of flexibility in the system, because the RBA for some time now has been saying neither are a concern. In its latest statement on monetary policy, the RBA noted that: \u201cLow wage growth has been broad-based across public and private sectors, industries and states. All industries have experienced wage growth below their decade averages.\u201d It also noted that \u201cincreased labour market flexibility is likely to have provided firms with greater scope to adjust wages\u201d and that \u201cthis low wage growth may have encouraged firms to employ more people than would otherwise have been the case.\u201d If that is the pendulum swinging too greatly towards union control, please spare us from it being more \u201cin the middle\u201d. And you don\u2019t need to listen to the RBA, the data shows the system is working as it should. A comparison of wages growth in the mining sector with the total growth shows with the end of the mining boom has come the end of any wages boom as well: When we transfer this to state-by-state growth, it\u2019s clear Western Australia is struggling, with private sector wage growth in that state a chilled 1.6% (another record) whereas in New South Wales and Victoria, where jobs have been more plentiful of late, wages are growing by 2.2% and 2.4%. And across industries, we see that even though the construction sector has seen some level of boom, wage growth is among the lowest of all industries. Not far above that industry is the wage rises of the transport, postal and warehousing industry which includes dockside workers. Someone really should get on the phone to tell the CFMEU and MUA that under the Fair Work Act, they\u2019re back in charge now: The system is working as it should. Indeed, as Justin Smirk, the senior economist with Westpac Economic Research has noted, given the historically low wage growth is occurring at a time hours worked is rising, you could argue wages are not performing as expected, but worse than they should be: Usually when hours worked rises, wage rises increase. But since 2013 the opposite has occurred. If anything, the data would suggest there is perhaps too much \u201cflexibility\u201d in the system and too much of an ability for businesses to keep wage rises down even as they increase employment and hours worked. The limp wages growth also makes Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s worries about bracket creep rather a bit overblown. Yes, over time wage rises put people into a higher tax bracket (at least for some of their income) but currently that is happening more slowly than ever before. The concern for most workers isn\u2019t that their pay rise might put them into a higher tax bracket, but that their pay rise will stay above inflation. On this score, the low wage rises actually have some good news. Due to the extremely low growth in the cost of living for employees, real wages are growing at around 1.4% a year: This is historically quite high, and agrees with the national accounts data that has shown that real labour costs have risen in the past 18 months. But the reason hasn\u2019t been a wages breakout, but rather that inflation has been so low that it is almost impossible for wages to stay below or equal with them. Consider that employee cost of living grew by just 0.7% in the past year \u2013 would you agree to a wage rise of just that amount? And given most enterprise agreements are for three years, would you agree to a wage rise of just 2.1% over the next three years? Given the low cost of living is mostly due to the RBA cutting interest rates, you would be foolish to do so. As the RBA is unlikely to cut further, and even if they did, rates are expected to rise with the next three years, expecting cost of living to stay that low is very ambitious. Consider over the past three years, in which interest rates have been slashed and overall inflation growth has been near record low, the cost of living still rose on average by 1.23% each year. Currently union officials expect inflation to rise by 2.3% annually over the next two years \u2013 a level lower than market economists predict: And so our wages continue to grow meekly, and the IR system continues to work as those who value a flexible system would wish it to. The question for the future is thus not whether a wages blowout is about to come, but will wages respond to improved employment growth and hours worked? Or has the \u201cflexibility\u201d in the system really just ingrained low wages for the foreseeable future?",

Yes, over time wage rises put people into a higher tax bracket (at least for some of their income) but currently that is happening more slowly than ever before. </p> <p>The concern for most workers isn\u2019t that their pay rise might put them into a higher tax bracket, but that their pay rise will stay above inflation. </p> <p>On this score, the low wage rises actually have some good news.

The study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the UK is a more unequal country when measured by wealth \u2013 the value of assets such as housing, pensions and shares \u2013 than it is when measured by income. At one end of the scale, the poorest 1% of households have negative net wealth of more than \u00a316,000 \u2013 the result of their debts being higher than the value of any assets they might hold. At the other end, the top 1% of households have net wealth of more than \u00a32.4m. With seven out of 10 households owning their homes outright or buying them through a mortgage, the IFS analysis found that the wealth of the median household \u2013 the one in the middle of the distribution \u2013 was \u00a3172,000. The IFS said the Gini coefficient measure of wealth inequality stood at 0.65, with a rating of zero equivalent to a country in which wealth was shared equally and a rating of 1.0 for a country in which all wealth was in the hands of a single person. The Gini coefficient for income stood at 0.40. The study covered trends in wealth during the four-year period 2006-08 and 2010-12 \u2013 a time when a deep recession and a sluggish recovery led to falling house prices. It found that, largely due to changes in pension wealth, younger households were on course to be less asset-rich than their parents. The IFS said that after stripping out changes in how future pension income was valued, mean pension wealth increased in real terms (ie after adjusting for inflation) by around \u00a313,000 for households aged 25-34, \u00a332,000 for households aged 35-44 and \u00a338,000 for households aged 45-54. \u201cDespite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements,\u201d said Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report. \u201cEven with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\u201d The IFS said that among households aged 25-34, nearly a quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement, while nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension. However, 28% of individuals expected an inheritance to provide them with some retirement resources. Rowena Crawford, a senior research economist at the IFS and also an author of the report, said: \u201cIt is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income.
