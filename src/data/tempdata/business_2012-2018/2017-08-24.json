      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top companies could be forced to disclose and explain the pay gap between their chief executive and workers under plans to be set out by Theresa May as she tries to show her domestic reform agenda remains on track. Despite the Conservatives\u2019 disastrous general election performance, the government is keen to demonstrate that it will get to grips with rising corporate pay in plans expected to be announced next week. Government sources stressed that the pay transparency plans were only one aspect of a package of measures aimed at reining in boardroom excess and making Britain\u2019s companies work better. The green paper on the subject, published last year, raised the question of whether companies should publish ratios comparing CEO pay with earnings in the wider company workforce. Implementing it would represent a response to Labour. Jeremy Corbyn put tackling inequality at the heart of his general election campaign and aired a proposal for a pay cap that would limit the highest paid member of staff to 20 times the average worker for companies with public sector contracts. However, May is treading a difficult path between public concern about fat cat pay packets and her party\u2019s business backers. She has already backed away from more radical proposals, including legislating for workers\u2019 representatives on boards \u2013 and campaigners against corporate excess are likely to warn that the plans lack teeth. May originally raised the prospect of a crackdown on executive pay in her Tory leadership bid in July 2016 in a speech that included proposals to allow employee and consumer representatives to sit on company boards, and make shareholder votes on executive pay legally binding. However, when a green paper was published in November the prime minister faced criticism from unions for backtracking on installing workers\u2019 representatives on boards, while opposition MPs questioned whether enough safeguards were being put in place to avoid a rerun of the debacle at the collapsed department store chain BHS. The green paper launched a three-month consultation asking for submissions on issues including whether shareholders should be given a binding vote on executive pay, how employees could be heard in the boardroom and whether private companies should be subjected to some of the rules faced by companies listed on the stock market. The document provided a number of options on each area \u2013 including the binding vote, which it suggested could be only on part of a director\u2019s pay packet or when there had been significant protests about pay in the past. The green paper asked whether companies should publish their pay ratio \u2013 the gap between the chief executive and the wider workforce \u2013 but also cautioned that the information could be misconstrued. In 2015 chief executives received 128 times the average pay of their staff, the document said. It also included proposals, first raised by the fund manager Hermes, which could require companies to set out the maximum amount a chief executive could earn. The paper asked if the current system of paying bosses though long-term incentive plans \u2013 share awards that pay out in three years \u2013 should be thrown out. It also questioned if pay deals should be based over three rather than five years. A pledge to rein in executive pay was also included in the Tory manifesto published in May before the general election, although it included little detail. Ordinary employees would have to work for 160 years to earn the average remuneration of FTSE 100 chief executives in 2016, according to the High Pay Centre\u2019s annual survey of top executive pay, published earlier this month. The average take-home pay for the bosses of Britain\u2019s top stock market-listed companies was \u00a34.5m last year, according to the High Pay Centre\u2019s annual survey of top executive pay. This compares to Office for National Statistics figures showing average annual earnings of \u00a328,200 for full-time employees in the year to April 2016. The report also shows that male FTSE 100 bosses earned 77% more on average than their female counterparts last year. This year\u2019s report highlighted one positive trend \u2013 the average pay of a chief executive has fallen by 17% from \u00a35.4m to \u00a34.5m over the year. But it would take the average worker 1,718 years to accrue the \u00a348.1m annual remuneration of Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of marketing and advertising business WPP, who is Britain\u2019s highest paid FTSE 100 boss.",

      "bodyText": "The downside to a weak pound is immediately apparent because imports get dearer and foreign holidays get more expensive. With sterling at its lowest level for eight years, there have been plenty of horror stories of travellers from the UK being gouged by foreign exchange bureaux. The benefits of a weaker currency tend to be less obvious but are potentially significant nonetheless. Exports become cheaper and the UK becomes a more attractive destination for overseas tourists. This leads to an improvement in the balance of payments, something that is sorely needed in Britain\u2019s case. A breakdown of the UK\u2019s latest growth figures shows that the impact of a lower pound on consumption is coming through much more quickly than its impact on trade. A year after the sharp depreciation of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote, household spending growth has virtually stalled. Some of that was due to consumers bringing forward purchases of new cars in order to beat changes in vehicle excise duty but for the most part it was a response to the squeeze on living standards caused by the sterling-induced jump in the cost of living. Meanwhile, net trade \u2013 which measures how imports and exports have changed over the latest quarter \u2013 contributed a big fat zero to growth in the three months to June. This was a bit better than the first quarter, when trade actually subtracted from growth. But only a supreme optimist would say that what we are witnessing here is the J-curve effect \u2013 the tendency for the trade figures to get worse before they get better after a depreciation. The truth is that there should have been a discernible improvement in net trade by now, particularly with the global economy doing a bit better. The glass-half-full way of looking at the latest growth figures is that the doomsday scenario predicted by the Treasury a year ago has not come to pass. It may be that the first half of 2017 is as bad as it gets. The glass-half-empty way of looking at things is that Britain is now the slowest growing economy in the G7 courtesy of weak investment, cautious consumers and its failure to exploit the opportunity afforded by sterling\u2019s depreciation. Britain runs a healthy trade surplus in services, but demand for lawyers, architects and management consultants tends not to be price sensitive, so a falling pound makes little real difference. The real problem is that Britain\u2019s manufacturing base is now too small to take advantage of a more competitive exchange rate. The Brexit vote has starkly illuminated that the productive capacity simply isn\u2019t there. Smartphones have gone the way of the washing machine Washing machines are getting more sophisticated. Every time Bosch or Hotpoint bring out a new model it has new features and gadgets. Yet few consumers would take their old Samsung to the dump just because something is now available with a faster spin speed. The profits warning by Dixons Carphone suggests something similar is happening with mobile phones. People are no longer trading in their smartphone every six or nine months so that they can have the latest gizmo: as with cookers, fridges and washing machines, they change them only when they stop working. In part, that\u2019s a function of the falling value of the pound, which has pushed up the cost of imported handsets. But there\u2019s more to it than that. For a start, mobile phone makers are offering only incremental improvements when they release new models. But, just as importantly, yesterday\u2019s luxury goods become today\u2019s commodities. That has happened to desktop computers and laptops \u2013 it is now happening to smartphones as well. Let\u2019s be clear. While the profits warning at Dixons Carphone was bad for the company\u2019s investors, it was good for everybody else. Chucking away perfectly workable smartphones every few months simply as a fashion statement represents the worst form of banal, eco-unfriendly consumerism. If consumers are no longer looking for more megapixels on their smartphone camera, it is clear what they are looking for: longer battery life. That would be good for the environment. It probably wouldn\u2019t be bad for profits either.",

    "webTitle": "Pound edges up as UK economy grows by 0.3% in second quarter - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter, in line with the initial estimates. But consumer spending, exports and business investment all proved disappointing. The weak pound following the Brexit vote has hit people\u2019s pockets but not proved as much of a benefit to exporters as expected. The consumer squeeze left retail sales at their weakest since July 2016, according to the CBI. And although the third quarter figure was an improvement on the 0.2% growth in the first three months of the year, it still means the UK is showing the slowest growth among the G7 economies. But the pound regained some ground following the GDP numbers, after languishing at 8 year lows against the euro. Investors remained cautious ahead of Friday\u2019s key speeches from the ECB and Federal Reserve at the Jackson Hole symposium in the US. Meanwhile UK car production grew in July ahead of the summer shutdown. Elsewhere the Spanish economy continued to put in a good performance, while French business confidence rose in August. In the US weekly jobs claims edged higher but were lower than analyst forecast. On the stock markets, the FTSE 100 is up 0.5% and the FTSE 250 is holding steady despite a slump in Dixons Carphone shares after a surprise profit warning. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.5% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On the US jobs figures, Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Today\u2019s initial jobless claims data, while up from last month, will be welcome news for President Trump as his government continues pointing to solid labor market figures as the benchmark for economic strength. The US President took to social media earlier this week to claim his tenure at the White House has already created over one million jobs and, while figures may be debated, jobless claims look to be heading towards a multi-decade low. However, despite the figures remaining under the 250k target, it seems today\u2019s data will do little to shift the market\u2019s bearish view of the dollar at present. Trump\u2019s \u2018government shut down\u2019 claims earlier this week have done nothing to help investors buy the greenback, but continued improvement on the employment situation certainly won\u2019t harm long term aspirations for US economy growth. Weekly initial jobless claims in the US rose last week but by slightly less than expected. They climbed from 232,000 the week before to 234,000, but this was below the forecast of 238,000. The Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, sponsored by the Kansas City Federal Reserve, is in focus because of speeches by ECB boss Mario Draghi and Fed chair Janet Yellen. Draghi\u2019s speech will be closely watched for clues about an end to its bond buying programme, while Yellen is expected to comment on the prospect of future rate rises. Ahead of the meeting, Kansas City Fed president Esther George has been promoting the idea of more rate increases. The weak pound is hitting consumer spending more than it is benefiting exporters, it seems. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The downside to a weak pound is immediately apparent because imports get dearer and foreign holidays get more expensive. With sterling at its lowest level for eight years, there have been plenty of horror stories of travellers from the UK being gouged by foreign exchange bureaux. The benefits of a weaker currency tend to be less obvious but are potentially significant nonetheless. Exports become cheaper and the UK becomes a more attractive destination for overseas tourists. This leads to an improvement in the balance of payments, something that is sorely needed in Britain\u2019s case. A breakdown of the UK\u2019s latest growth figures shows that the impact of a lower pound on consumption is coming through much more quickly than its impact on trade. A year after the sharp depreciation of the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote, household spending growth has virtually stalled... Meanwhile, net trade \u2013 which measures how imports and exports have changed over the latest quarter \u2013 contributed a big fat zero to growth in the three months to June. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: More UK recession talk: Today\u2019s mini-recovery in sterling is hardly convincing. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The bar has been set so low for the pound this week that the confirmation of a measly 0.3% Q2 GDP reading gave the currency a helping hand. Investors clearly weren\u2019t ready to take a look at the ins and outs of the GDP report \u2013 household spending growth is at its lowest since the end of 2014, while business investment plunged from 0.6% in Q1 to 0.0% in Q2. Instead ignoring all this cable climbed 0.1%, flopping back over $1.28, while against the euro the pound jumped 0.4%. As ever it is important to note that kind of growth barely begins to scratch the surface of the losses suffered by the pound against its Eurozone peer this summer, with sterling still stuck under \u20ac1.09. The pound may be edging up after the GDP data, but trade weighting sterling - a measure based on how much trade is done with different countries and in various currencies - is close to a record low. At the moment it is up 0.27% at 74.8, but is not far off the trough of 73.3 reached in December 2008 during the financial crisis. The pound has been hit by continuing concerns about the Brexit negotiations, as well as recent strength in the euro. More signs of weak UK consumer spending. Retail sales are at their weakest since July 2016 according to the latest CBI report. Its distributive trades survey showed a retail sales balance of -10, compared to +22 in July and the expectation of a figure of +14. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: Despite the warmer weather at the start of the month, retail sales have cooled as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers\u2019 pockets. Meanwhile, deteriorating sentiment regarding the business situation has combined with falling headcount among retailers. Looking ahead, firms do expect sales growth to recover, but the pressures on household budgets are set to persist, given little sign of wages picking up. The CBI said: Grocers saw stable sales on the year, following strong growth last month, and footwear and leather performed well, whilst specialist food and drink stores reported another month of significantly falling sales. Year-on-year internet sales growth slowed, edging further below the long-run average, but growth is expected to pick up next month. Here is our GDP story, focusing on the weak consumer spending figures. Richard Partington reports: Spending by British consumers is growing at the weakest rate in almost three years, as households squeezed by rising prices tighten their belts. Household spending growth slowed to 0.1% in the three months to June, the Office for National Statistics said, the slowest rate of quarterly growth since the final three months of 2014. Business investment in the British economy showed no growth at all in the second quarter. The slowdown in private consumption, which was worse than expected by City economists, comes as rising inflation and weaker levels of wage growth puts the squeeze on household budgets. The slump in the value of the pound since the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last year is also taking its toll. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cConsumer spending is likely to be pressurised through the latter months of the year by an ongoing appreciable squeeze on purchasing power. Indeed, real incomes growth is likely to remain negative for some months to come.\u201d Some of the fall in household spending could be down to consumers shifting their car purchases to beat a tax change earlier this year, according to analysts at Capital Economics. \u201cWe remain optimistic that a modest acceleration in growth in the second half of the year is in prospect,\u201d said Paul Hollingworth, UK economist at the consultancy. The full story is here: Guardian economics writer Phillip Inman says the lack of an export surge in the latest GDP figures to counter higher priced imports has left Britain with a trade problem: A significant depreciation of sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote was expected to boost exports. It has a little, but not enough to offset the extra cost from more expensive raw materials. It means that the latest figures for second quarter GDP show that net trade was zero, putting a drag on GDP growth. And it has dragged since sterling first began to depreciate at the end of 2015. As Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics points out, this contrasts with the boost to GDP from net trade that has followed every depreciation in the pound since the second world war. The reason could be that Brexit uncertainty has encouraged a degree of reticence among exporters. But more likely, the explanation lies in the changing nature of supply chains that send parts all over the world and back again, turning almost every component in a manufactured good into an import at some stage of the process. The fluctuations in the pound continue. Sterling has now risen 0.17% to $1.2820 while it is 0.31% better against the euro at \u20ac1.0873. More reaction to the GDP numbers: Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF: Today\u2019s GDP revisions tell a familiar story for the UK economy for the first half of this year. We\u2019ve got weaker growth \u2013 relative to both our performance in the past couple of years and increasingly our developed world counterparts. The most recent three months growth has been almost entirely reliant on spending by households and government, and depending too much on the former looks risky given the continuing squeeze on real incomes. Another quarter passes without any sustained positive contribution from either net trade or business investment, which doesn\u2019t feel like the most stable of foundations for a post-Brexit economy. While businesses will continue to grapple with Brexit related uncertainty the need for a clear industrial strategy to spur investment and capitalise on growth in world markets is becoming ever clearer.\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte: The post-referendum drop in the pound has knocked consumer spending and hit growth. UK exporters are upbeat, but this has not yet to translate into stronger export volumes. Over the next 18 months the UK will likely see subpar growth, but exports and manufacturing can help offset the headwinds from a weaker consumer. The UK is the slowest growing G7 economy this year, with the Brexit risk dampening business investment and the pound\u2019s fall hurting consumers more than it helped exports, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Chief UK economist Samuel Tombs said: Looking ahead, we expect the economy to continue to struggle, with GDP rising by just 0.2% in both Q3 and Q4. Recent surveys of export orders have picked up, but exporters are too reliant on imports for net trade to fully offset a further slowdown in consumers\u2019 spending. Indeed, CPI inflation still has further to climb, and the sharp fall in consumers\u2019 confidence over the last two months suggests that households won\u2019t continue to cut their saving rate. Meanwhile, we expect Brexit risk to increasingly bear down on business investment as the UK\u2019s exit date draws nearer. Here\u2019s some commentary on the GDP figures: Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: Consumption, the engine of UK growth for decades, looks like it is finally starting to slow in response to the reality that the post-EU referendum economy now faces. Consumers are tightening their belts in the face of higher prices and lower wage settlements while businesses, unable to protect margins given higher input costs, are holding back on investment as the nature of the UK\u2019s trading relationships with the world is left in flux. The pound has slipped in response to today\u2019s figures and the pressures that the UK economy is under are not dissipating anytime soon. We expect that we will be talking about a recession in 2018. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: UK second quarter GDP has come in line with expectations at an unchanged 0.3% quarter on quarter from the first reading. Perhaps more significantly, separate figures show total business investment in the UK has stalled to zero after 0.6% previously. Although the headline figure remains the same, there has been some shuffle amongst the internals. Perhaps most worryingly, consumer spending has risen 0.1%, the least since the 4th quarter of 2014. Increased government spending made up some of the deficit while net trade had no impact. Sluggish growth adds credence to the notion of the UK economy nearing a Brexit-induced cliff-edge. Recent signs of falling business confidence become of particular concern when they translate into the \u2018hard data\u2019. Nonetheless, while UK growth trudges along at a slow pace, the Bank of England will view it as offset by above-target inflation. The decision whether to raise rates is still finely balanced and we expect the Bank of England to continue to do what they know best, nothing. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: The UK\u2019s economy continues to rumble on despite threats of the Brexit bogeyman on the horizon. The small rise in wage growth has been negated by inflation and the effect of sustained price rises is taking a bite out of consumer spending power. Fears of cheap consumer debt fuelling spending is proving to be a thorn in the Bank of England\u2019s side as it tries to navigate the potential need for a rate rise. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: Second quarter UK GDP remained unrevised at 0.3%, but what matters today are the underlying growth drivers - and on consumption, the news isn\u2019t encouraging. Having grown fairly consistently at a rate of 0.7-0.8% each quarter in 2016, consumer spending slumped to a two and a half year low of just 0.1% quarter on quarter. This result is particularly worrying, given retail sales data had suggested the combination of a late Easter and the second warmest June on record had given retailers temporary respite from the household income squeeze. But today\u2019s data does support the findings of other data providers - notably Visa and the British Retail Consortium - who have suggested that recent months have been particularly slow for spending as consumers cut back on non-essentials. Of course, today\u2019s GDP data is fairly backwards-looking - so the question now is whether the squeeze on household incomes has peaked as Deputy Bank of England Governor Broadbent suggested recently. We think inflation will continue to edge closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the remainder of the pound\u2019s depreciation filters through. Meanwhile, wage growth looks set to hover around 2% as firms grapple with elevated uncertainty, higher import costs and slowing economic momentum. For similar reasons, investment remained flat in the second quarter and is unlikely to stage a strong recovery over the next couple of quarters. Putting all of that that together, we suspect growth will remain stay sluggish for at least the next few months. This limits the chances of a Bank of England rate hike this year or early next. The revised growth figures showed the service sector was the biggest riser, up 0.5% quarter on quarter. Otherwise production fell by 0.3%, construction dropped by 1.3% and agriculture decreased by 0.4%. Overall the service sector was the only positive contributor to GDP growth: The pound is struggling in the wake of the revised GDP figures. Against the dollar it has slipped back from its earlier (unconvincing) gains, 0.09% down at $1.2787. But it is holding a 0.08% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.0848. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: The slight improvement [in GDP from the first quarter] has done little to alter the fortunes of the pound with the currency falling to its lowest level since June against the US dollar this morning and sterling remains close to its 8 year low against the Euro (if we exclude the flash crash last October when prices were erratic). Within the GDP figures, business investment stands out. It was flat during the quarter compared to a 0.6% rise in the first three months of the year and expectations of a 0.4% increase. In the event the outcome was the weakest since the fourth quarter of last year. However capital investment was stronger than expected at 0.7%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: Business investment was flat, however capital investment was stronger than expected. One would expect business to be cautious ahead of the Brexit negotiations, however, the fact that capital investment (ie, building things) is stronger than expected is good news, and suggests that some investors are willing to look through Brexit to our future outside of the EU. Government spending was also better than forecast at 0.6% rather than 0.3%. But consumer spending was just 0.1% quarter on quarter, while exports rose by only 0.7% rather than the 1% expected. Brooks said: This is likely to leave investors concerned that the UK export sector may never be able to benefit from nothing to GDP last quarter. BREAKING NEWS: The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to June, in line with initial estimates. This equates to annual growth of 1.7%. Spain\u2019s economy grew by 0.9% in the second quarter compared to the first, new figures have confirmed. This is a rise from 0.8% in the first quarter and equates to annual growth of 3.1%. Geoffrey Minne at ING said: Spanish growth is not only strong and impressive, but it also seems to be on a more sustainable footing than it was before the housing crisis. The combination of strong domestic demand and a positive contribution of external demand should lead GDP growth to top 3% for a third consecutive year. To repeat this result in 2018, several political issues will need to be resolved, notably in Catalonia. Earlier, a new report showed a rise in French business confidence, with morale in the industrial sector hitting a near ten year high. According to statistics office INSEE, the overall confidence index rose to 109 from 108 in July with the industrial figure rising from 108 to 111, its best level since December 2007. Economist Julien Manceaux at ING Bank said: Business climate indicators by INSEE showed another improvement for August this morning. The trend is led by manufacturing but confidence in the service sector remains very high. The main disappointing points in this release were the weaker hiring intentions shown in the service survey while future retail sales prospects declined strongly... All in all, this week\u2019s surveys are an indication of the continuing recovery in France, especially in manufacturing. French growth \u2013 having slowed from 1.2% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 - is set to rebound to 1.5% in 2017. Afterwards, if the new Government can take profit from the accelerating recovery to implement reforms, GDP growth could accelerate towards 1.7% in 2018. The pound is struggling to hold up, as the uncertainty over the Brexit negotiations continues to weigh on the currency. Against the dollar - which has its own problems including Trump\u2019s threat to shut down the US government if he doesn\u2019t get funds for his Mexico wall - the pound has only managed to remain unchanged at $1.2798. Against the euro, after hitting eight year lows, it has edgd up 0.11% to \u20ac1.0851. But the imminent GDP figures could cause further ructions. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities said: The release of the Gross Domestic Product report is being seen as a risk event for the British currency. Even though expectations are set for a steady reading it is unlikely that a stronger set of figures will help the pound recover. However, if there is a softer printing of the GDP report this would highlight the concerns about Britain\u2019s future outside the European Union and this could lead to strong selling of sterling. With the pound trading just below the 1.2800 level this morning further pressure has the potential to take the price towards 1.2700. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Analysts are expecting the second quarter figure to come in unchanged at a paltry 0.3% \u2013 a surprise revision could make a bad week for the pound worse, or help the currency lift away from its recent lows. Also worth paying attention to is the quarterly preliminary business investment figure, which is forecast to fall from 0.6% in Q1 to 0.2% in Q2 \u2013 again, not exactly the kind of news sterling wants to hear right now. It\u2019s a tentative start for European markets but they are at least heading in the right direction, despite the continuing concerns about President Trump\u2019s policies, North Korea, and some nervousness ahead of this week\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers. The FTSE 100 is up 0.26% (although the mid-cap FTSE 250 is down 0.3% after the 32% slump in Dixons Carphone shares). Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.14 and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.27%. Back with the UK car production figures: Britain\u2019s car manufacturers geared up production last month ahead of the summer shutdown and a number plate change in September. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), UK car output rose by 7.8% last month after seven successive months of decline. Exports grew by 5.3%. Car production has now passed the one million mark this year, although this is down 1.6% compared to the same time last year. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: UK car production lines stepped up a gear in July, as usual bringing forward some production to help manage demand ahead of September and routine summer factory shutdowns. As the timing and length of these manufacturing pauses can shift each year, market performance comparisons for July and August should always be treated with caution, but as long as the economic conditions at home and abroad stay broadly stable we expect new car production to remain in line with expectations for the rest of 2017. Very wise to treat the figures with caution. On Wednesday the SMMT embarrassingly had to reissue its second quarter used car figures. It originally said used car sales had slumped by 13.5%. In a revision it said that was actually a mere 0.7% decline. It blamed \u201can issue\u201d with an algorithm used to calculate the data. BREAKING: Dixons Carphone shares have plunged 22% in early trading following its profit warning. The shares have now almost halved so far this year. A little more detail on the Jackson Hole central bank meeting, courtesy of RBC Capital Markets: The annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium begins later tonight when the programme for this year\u2019s gathering will be released (at 6pm local time, 1am UK time). The main address of interest to European markets, that of ECB president Mario Draghi, has already been confirmed by the ECB for 8pm (BST) on Friday evening. For today, there is only one ECB speaker of note, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco, who will speak later this evening. Here\u2019s our story on the Dixons Carphone profit warning: Dixons Carphone has warned of a steep fall in profits this year, as customers hold on to their phones for longer after the weaker pound pushed up the price of new handsets. In an unscheduled trading statement, the company said it expects profits in the range of \u00a3360 to 440m this year, down from \u00a3501m last year. Analysts had on average been forecasting a profit of \u00a3495m. Dixons said the UK mobile phone market had become tougher in the last few months. Due to currency fluctuations \u2013 including the sharp fall in the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote \u2013 handsets have become more expensive, so people are keeping their phones longer before upgrading to a new model. Chief executive Seb James said: \u201cWe have seen an increased number of people hold on to their phones for longer and while it is too early to say whether important upcoming handset launches or the natural life cycle of phones will reverse this trend, we now believe it is prudent to plan on the basis that the overall market demand will not correct itself this year.\u201d More here: One share likely to do badly when trading begins is Dixons Carphone. The electronics and phone retailer has downgraded its profit expectations for the year, blaming tougher conditions in the mobile phone market, including peoply holding on to their phones for longer. It said profits were likely to be between \u00a3360m and \u00a3440m, down on the average forecast of \u00a3495m (according to Thomson Reuters). The company\u2019s chief executive tweeted: But retail analyst Nick Bubb was not impressed: It looks like being a caution start to trading for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest news from the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers will be gathering at the Jackson Hole mountain resort in the US later for the start a symposium to discuss the key economic issues of the day. The big events will be on Friday, with European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen both due to speak. Markets are likely to be nervous ahead of any hints from either about their future policy, whether Draghi hints at an end to the bank\u2019s bond buying programme or Yellen suggests further rate rises are on the way. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The markets believe that the ECB is on course to begin tapering their stimulus program, and the only unknown is the timing of such measures. Whether Draghi likes it or not the ECB will have to cut back on stimulus simply because the outstanding bonds available to buy is diminishing rapidly, and the continued expansion in economic activity and factory growth points to a fairly resilient recovery in Europe. The continuing rise in the euro - it is at an eight year high against the pound - causes problems for Draghi in terms of ending stimulus. Any hawkish hints from his Jackson Hole speech could see the euro rise further. Ahead of all that, today sees the latest revision to UK GDP. The economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, according to the initial estimate, up slightly from 0.2% in the first three months but lagging the likes of Germany. Hewson again: Today\u2019s second estimate will have the benefit of slightly more data to work with, however expectations are for an unchanged reading of 0.3%, with a moderate decline in business investment to 0.2% from 0.6%. Services once again are expected to make up the lion\u2019s share of the expansion with 0.5%, as the weak pound prompts resilience from overseas visitors in the travel and leisure sector. The main puzzle remains around the divergence from private survey data, and the ONS numbers which have been uniformly negative. For all of this year these independent surveys have been much more optimistic, from the likes of the CBI and the Markit, and quite frankly better when it comes to reporting the improvement in order books in terms of surging export markets, as well as rising employment levels in the sector. There are also CBI retail sales figures for August, and in the US, weekly jobless claims. We have already had a profit warning from Dixons Carphone, and UK car manufacturing figures, of which more shortly. As for the pound, it is currently at \u20ac1.0833 against the euro, down 0.06% on the day, and 0.13% lower against the dollar at $1.2781.

It has a little, but not enough to offset the extra cost from more expensive raw materials.</p> <p>It means that the latest figures for second quarter GDP show that net trade was zero, putting a drag on GDP growth. And it has dragged since sterling first began to depreciate at the end of 2015.</p> <p>As Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics points out, this contrasts with the boost to GDP from net trade that has followed every depreciation in the pound since the second world war.</p> <p>The reason could be that Brexit uncertainty has encouraged a degree of reticence among exporters.

Perhaps more significantly, separate figures show total business investment in the UK has stalled to zero after 0.6% previously.</p> <p>Although the headline figure remains the same, there has been some shuffle amongst the internals. Perhaps most worryingly, consumer spending has risen 0.1%, the least since the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2014. Increased government spending made up some of the deficit while net trade had no impact.</p> <p>Sluggish growth adds credence to the notion of the UK economy nearing a Brexit-induced cliff-edge. Recent signs of falling business confidence become of particular concern when they translate into the \u2018hard data\u2019. Nonetheless, while UK growth trudges along at a slow pace, the Bank of England will view it as offset by above-target inflation. The decision whether to raise rates is still finely balanced and we expect the Bank of England to continue to do what they know best, nothing.</p> <h2><strong>Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management:</strong></h2> <p>The UK\u2019s economy continues to rumble on despite threats of the Brexit bogeyman on the horizon. The small rise in wage growth has been negated by inflation and the effect of sustained price rises is taking a bite out of consumer spending power. Fears of cheap consumer debt fuelling spending is proving to be a thorn in the Bank of England\u2019s side as it tries to navigate the potential need for a rate rise.</p> <h2>James Smith, economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p>Second quarter UK GDP remained unrevised at 0.3%, but what matters today are the underlying growth drivers - and on consumption, the news isn\u2019t encouraging.</p> <p>Having grown fairly consistently at a rate of 0.7-0.8% each quarter in 2016, consumer spending slumped to a two and a half year low of just 0.1% quarter on quarter. This result is particularly worrying, given retail sales data had suggested the combination of a late Easter and the second warmest June on record had given retailers temporary respite from the household income squeeze. </p> <p>But today\u2019s data does support the findings of other data providers - notably Visa and the British Retail Consortium - who have suggested that recent months have been particularly slow for spending as consumers cut back on non-essentials. </p> <p>Of course, today\u2019s GDP data is fairly backwards-looking - so the question now is whether the squeeze on household incomes has peaked as Deputy Bank of England Governor Broadbent suggested recently. </p> <p>We think inflation will continue to edge closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the remainder of the pound\u2019s depreciation filters through. Meanwhile, wage growth looks set to hover around 2% as firms grapple with elevated uncertainty, higher import costs and slowing economic momentum. For similar reasons, investment remained flat in the second quarter and is unlikely to stage a strong recovery over the next couple of quarters.</p> <p>Putting all of that that together, we suspect growth will remain stay sluggish for at least the next few months. This limits the chances of a Bank of England rate hike this year or early next.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599e93d4e4b0d26e26a9eeef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-24T08:58:07.029Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The revised growth figures showed the service sector was the biggest riser, up 0.5% quarter on quarter.</p> <p>Otherwise production fell by 0.3%, construction dropped by 1.3% and agriculture decreased by 0.4%.</p> <p>Overall the service sector was the only positive contributor to GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d251084b042c8de9044a6057852123ada6feb11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d251084b042c8de9044a6057852123ada6feb11/0_0_700_687/500.jpg\" alt=\"gdp1\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-599e9149e4b009691a5a8f77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-24T08:45:41.423Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound is struggling in the wake of the revised GDP figures.</p> <p>Against the dollar it has slipped back from its earlier (unconvincing) gains, 0.09% down at $1.2787.</p> <p>But it is holding a 0.08% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.0848.

The big events will be on Friday, with European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen both due to speak. Markets are likely to be nervous ahead of any hints from either about their future policy, whether Draghi hints at an end to the bank\u2019s bond buying programme or Yellen suggests further rate rises are on the way.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets believe that the ECB is on course to begin tapering their stimulus program, and the only unknown is the timing of such measures. Whether Draghi likes it or not the ECB will have to cut back on stimulus simply because the outstanding bonds available to buy is diminishing rapidly, and the continued expansion in economic activity and factory growth points to a fairly resilient recovery in Europe.</p> </blockquote> <p>The continuing rise in the euro - it is at an eight year high against the pound - causes problems for Draghi in terms of ending stimulus. Any hawkish hints from his Jackson Hole speech could see the euro rise further.</p> <p>Ahead of all that, today sees the latest revision to UK GDP. The economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, according to the initial estimate, up slightly from 0.2% in the first three months but lagging the likes of Germany. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s second estimate will have the benefit of slightly more data to work with, however expectations are for an unchanged reading of 0.3%, with a moderate decline in business investment to 0.2% from 0.6%. </p> <p>Services once again are expected to make up the lion\u2019s share of the expansion with 0.5%, as the weak pound prompts resilience from overseas visitors in the travel and leisure sector. </p> <p>The main puzzle remains around the divergence from private survey data, and the ONS numbers which have been uniformly negative.</p> <p>For all of this year these independent surveys have been much more optimistic, from the likes of the CBI and the Markit, and quite frankly better when it comes to reporting the improvement in order books in terms of surging export markets, as well as rising employment levels in the sector.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are also CBI retail sales figures for August, and in the US, weekly jobless claims.</p> <p>We have already had a profit warning from Dixons Carphone, and UK car manufacturing figures, of which more shortly.</p> <p>As for the pound, it is currently at \u20ac1.0833 against the euro, down 0.06% on the day, and 0.13% lower against the dollar at $1.2781.</p> <p><strong>The agenda: </strong><br></p> <p>9.30 BST UK second quarter GDP</p> <p>11.00 BST CBI retail figures</p> <p>1.30 BST US weekly jobless claims <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-24T06:57:27.273Z\">at 7.57am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "webTitle": "UK consumer spending growing at weakest rate in nearly three years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spending by British consumers is growing at the weakest rate in almost three years, as households squeezed by rising prices tighten their belts. Household spending growth slowed to 0.1% in the three months to June, the Office for National Statistics said, the slowest rate of quarterly growth since the final three months of 2014. Business investment in the British economy showed no growth at all in the second quarter. The slowdown in private consumption, which was worse than expected by City economists, comes as rising inflation and weaker levels of wage growth puts the squeeze on household budgets. The slump in the value of the pound since the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last year is also taking its toll. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cConsumer spending is likely to be pressurised through the latter months of the year by an ongoing appreciable squeeze on purchasing power. Indeed, real incomes growth is likely to remain negative for some months to come.\u201d Some of the fall in household spending could be attributed to consumers shifting their car purchases to beat a tax change earlier this year, according to analysts at Capital Economics. \u201cWe remain optimistic that a modest acceleration in growth in the second half of the year is in prospect,\u201d said Paul Hollingworth, UK economist at the consultancy. After a 0.6% expansion in the first quarter, the flat level of business investment in the three months to June was particularly disappointing to economists, and could point to firms\u2019 concerns and uncertainties over Brexit limiting spending decisions. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the government should keep single-market membership on the negotiating table in Brexit talks to help bolster confidence among firms. \u201cInstead of getting match-fit for Brexit, business investment is sat on the bench and the economy is sliding towards the relegation zone,\u201d she said. The ONS reaffirmed its first estimate for gross domestic product growth in the first quarter of 0.3%, illustrating the sluggish pace of the UK economy. With inflation at close to peak levels, the Bank of England could be put off from raising interest rates before late 2018, or even early 2019, according to Archer. Britain\u2019s dominant services sector continued to drive the economy, offsetting a slump in construction and manufacturing. Although weaker consumer spending is worrying in the short term, it could allay fears over households continuing to spend on credit cards, potentially building problems for the future. Sebastian Burnside, a senior economist at RBS, said: \u201cHouseholds are responding by slowing that spending and putting their finances on a more stable footing. That might not be good for growth this quarter, but it is a much more reassuring sign for the longer term.\u201d Separately, the CBI said retail sales declined in the year to August, disappointing expectations that growth would hold broadly steady. In a survey of 117 firms, of which 57 were retailers, the industry body found sales for the time of year were considered to be below normal to the greatest extent since October 2014. Anna Leach, the head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: \u201cRetail sales have cooled as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers\u2019 pockets. Looking ahead, firms do expect sales growth to recover, but the pressures on household budgets are set to persist, given little sign of wages picking up.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dixons Carphone has warned of a steep fall in profits this year, as customers hold on to their phones for longer after the weak pound pushed up the price of new handsets by up to a fifth. The shares plunged more than 30% to 161p, which means their value has more than halved this year. In an unscheduled trading statement, the company, which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said it now expects profits in the range of \u00a3360 to \u00a3440m this year, down from \u00a3501m last year. Analysts had been forecasting annual profits of \u00a3495m. The downgrade comes despite 6% growth in like-for-like sales in the first quarter ending in July. Dixons said the UK mobile phone market had become tougher in the last few months. Due to the sharp fall in the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote, handsets have gone up in price by 16% to 20%, it said, and there have been no phones coming onto the market with groundbreaking new features. The chief executive, Seb James, said people were holding on to their phones four to five months longer than previously, replacing them after 29 months on average rather than 24, and this trend was unlikely to change for the rest of this year. But he stressed there had been no change to how people use phones and that shorter battery life would force them to upgrade eventually. The scrapping of EU roaming charges in mid-June will result in a hit of \u00a310m to \u00a340m this year, Dixons said. It takes a slice of the lifetime value of mobile contracts. The profit warning raised fresh concerns over the health of Britain\u2019s high street retailers. The UK\u2019s two biggest home improvement chains, Kingfisher and Homebase, last week reported falling sales, partly due to wet weather. A survey from the CBI out at 11am BST should shed more light on the state of the retail sector. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising group, this week warned of a global economic slowdown. Dixons \u2013 the biggest seller of mobile phones and contracts in the UK \u2013 hopes that the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone 8, expected about 12 September, will bring customers back into its shops. James said: \u201cOne of the catalysts that will bring people into the market is a piece of technology they want to own. Everything we know about the iPhone 8 suggests it will be a popular product, but we are not betting the farm on it.\u201d He expects it to be better than the iPhone 7 and in line with the iPhone 6S, but not as good as the iPhone 6. Another new phone coming on to the market is Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8, which launched in New York on Wednesday. Analysts at Liberum noted that the new profit forecast range was \u201crelatively broad\u201d. They added: \u201cKey unknowns within this also include how successful the iPhone 8 will be and Dixons\u2019 trading performance over the key Christmas peak period to come.\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf was sceptical: \u201cThe forthcoming generation of Samsung Galaxy and iPhone handsets claim to make big steps forward, but recent history hasn\u2019t delivered much that\u2019s revolutionary. Seb James will be hoping Tim Cook has something big up his sleeve.\u201d Broker Exane BNP Paribas had already downgraded Dixons to \u201cunderperform\u201d earlier this month, pointing to changes in the mobile phone market and new competitors such as BT and Sky.",

Due to the sharp fall in the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote, handsets have gone up in price by 16% to 20%, it said, and there have been no phones coming onto the market with groundbreaking new features.</p> <p>The chief executive, Seb James, said people were holding on to their phones four to five months longer than previously, replacing them after 29 months on average rather than 24, and this trend was unlikely to change for the rest of this year. But he stressed there had been no change to how people use phones and that shorter battery life would force them to upgrade eventually.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/20/mobile-phone-roaming-charges-banned-europe-15-june-brexit\">The scrapping of EU roaming charges in mid-June</a> will result in a hit of \u00a310m to \u00a340m this year, Dixons said. It takes a slice of the lifetime value of mobile contracts.</p> <p>The profit warning raised fresh concerns over the health of Britain\u2019s high street retailers. The UK\u2019s two biggest home improvement chains, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/17/b-and-q-kingfisher-sales-uk-barbecues-garden-furniture\">Kingfisher and Homebase, last week reported falling sales</a>, partly due to wet weather. A survey from the CBI out at 11am BST should shed more light on the state of the retail sector. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sir-martin-sorrell\">Sir Martin Sorrell</a>, chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising group, this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/23/wpp-advertisers-spending-sir-martin-sorrell-growth-forecasts\">warned of a global economic slowdown</a>.<br></p> <p>Dixons \u2013 the biggest seller of mobile phones and contracts in the UK \u2013 hopes that the launch of Apple\u2019s iPhone 8, expected about 12 September, will bring customers back into its shops.</p> <p>James said: \u201cOne of the catalysts that will bring people into the market is a piece of technology they want to own. Everything we know about the iPhone 8 suggests it will be a popular product, but we are not betting the farm on it.\u201d </p> <p>He expects it to be better than the iPhone 7 and in line with the iPhone 6S, but not as good as the iPhone 6. Another new phone coming on to the market is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/23/samsung-launches-galaxy-note-8-fires-note-7-dual-cameras-infinity-screen-gif\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8, which launched in New York</a> on Wednesday.</p> <p>Analysts at Liberum noted that the new profit forecast range was \u201crelatively broad\u201d. They added: \u201cKey unknowns within this also include how successful the iPhone 8 will be and Dixons\u2019 trading performance over the key Christmas peak period to come.\u201d</p> <p>Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf was sceptical: \u201cThe forthcoming generation of Samsung Galaxy and iPhone handsets claim to make big steps forward, but recent history hasn\u2019t delivered much that\u2019s revolutionary. Seb James will be hoping Tim Cook has something big up his sleeve.\u201d</p> <p>Broker Exane BNP Paribas had already downgraded Dixons to \u201cunderperform\u201d earlier this month, pointing to changes in the mobile phone market and new competitors such as BT and Sky.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Adani has chosen to fight a $12,900 fine by the Queensland government for the unauthorised release of coal-laden stormwater into the sea at its Abbot Point port during a cyclone in March. The Indian energy giant has given notice to the state environment department that it intends to contest the modest penalty infringement notice in court, the Guardian can reveal. Environmental groups had lambasted the fine, which was issued on 20 July for a technical breach of a floodwater release permit, as a slap on the wrist. Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, the Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, said Adani was now \u201chaving a laugh\u201d after they \u201cbarely got a slap on the wrist\u201d for the environmental licence breach. \u201cFor a multibillion-dollar multinational to challenge such a meagre fine shows real contempt for the Queensland and Australian public,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this is their attitude now, what will it be like it they are allowed to construct a massive dirty new coalmine that would contribute to the destruction of our Great Barrier Reef and threaten our planet with more carbon pollution?\u201d An Adani company that operates the port dumped water containing more than eight times the permitted amount of sediment during Cyclone Debbie on 27 March. Adani reported the breach to the government 10 days later. Adani had far exceeded the \u201cgenerous conditions\u201d of a special licence to dump polluted water into the ocean during Cyclone Debbie, O\u2019Shanassy said. The company could still face a separate multimillion-dollar fine if found guilty of causing environmental harm from a release of polluted water into the neighbouring Caley Valley wetlands. That release is still subject to an ongoing investigation, according to the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. A spokeswoman for the department said on Thursday a court date for Adani\u2019s challenge to the fine had not yet been set. Adani has flagged spending $22bn on Australia\u2019s largest coal project in Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin. The infringement notice was issued to Abbot Point Bulk Coal Pty Ltd, a company which its Indian-listed parent has been trying to sell to a tax haven company linked to the Adani family for more than four years. The Abbot Point operator was granted a temporary licence to discharge stormwater with up to 100mg a litre of \u201csuspended solids\u201d as high rainfall from Debbie lashed the north Queensland coast. But the company told the department it had breached the licence with a release recording sediment at 806mg a litre. \u201cThe company\u2019s environmental authority and [temporary emissions licence] contained strict conditions that should have been adhered to in ensuring the environment was protected, especially during extreme weather events,\u201d the department said in a statement to Guardian Australia after issuing the fine. \u201cTemporary emissions licences and environmental authorities are not taken lightly by the department and there can be harsh penalties for companies that breach their approvals.\u201d The Guardian sought comment from two spokesmen for Adani in Australia. Adani has previously rejected claims by conservationists that coal-laden water had contaminated the Caley Valley wetlands and possibly coastal waters near the Great Barrier Reef marine park. The environment department\u2019s director general, Jim Reeves, has previously flagged that \u201cserious penalties\u201d for corporations causing environmental harm through licence breaches included fines of up to $3.8m for deliberate breaches and $2.7m for accidents.",
