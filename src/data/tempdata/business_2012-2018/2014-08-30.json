      "bodyText": "As Fran\u00e7ois Hollande reshuffled the French cabinet last week, he was handed a report warning of hundreds of thousands more job losses. For a president grappling with political crisis and record unemployment it will have made grim bedtime reading after a day spent revamping his government for the second time this year. The warning came from Jacques Attali, former special economic adviser to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who had been asked by Hollande to look into ways the global reach of the French language could help drag the country out of its economic quagmire. His report laid out two possible futures. In a best-case scenario, the right political support could foster a burgeoning global community of French speakers and enthusiasts that would \"create or preserve 360,000 jobs in France\" and perhaps even 1m by 2050. Attali calls this community of saviours the francophilophonie. But a darker future beckons, Attali warns, if the political establishment refuse to grasp what he terms \"the vast potential and great fragility\" of the French language. Without the tongue's preservation and promulgation around the world, the francophilophonie shrinks; French firms lose market share; French universities, French films, French food all lose their appeal. That would cost 120,000 jobs by 2020 and half a million by 2050. To avert this economic and cultural doomsday, the report has 53 recommendations, including encouraging the creation of French nursery schools overseas, building French cinemas and staging a global francophone festival. Much of it sounds expensive. What happens in 2050 is not Hollande's problem, at least politically. His critics don't even see him making it through the second half of his term. But long-term planning is vital to securing trade in a changing world. But surely the question for any head of state handed such a report is whether money for new cinemas and nurseries abroad would not be better spent on teaching more foreign languages at home. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that it would. In Britain, where \"everyone speaks English\" complacency has long dented our foreign-language ambitions, there have been a series of reports recently into the consequences of our monolingualism. The British Council looked at the linguistic problems pondered by Attali the other way around. Asking which foreign languages are most important to Britain's prosperity over the next 20 years, it analysed economic, geopolitical, cultural and educational factors. The research identified Spanish, Arabic, French, Mandarin and German. But an accompanying YouGov poll found an alarming shortage of people able to speak them. Three-quarters of 4,000 adults surveyed were unable to speak any of them well enough to hold a conversation. Attali was probably pleased to see French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, at 15%. Arabic, Mandarin, Russian or Japanese are each only spoken by 1%. Business groups say our linguistic deficiencies are hitting the bottom line and thwarting the government's ambitions to increase exports. Despite English being widely spoken, two-thirds of firms in the UK cited a need for foreign-language skills among staff, according to a poll by the CBI and education company Pearson. Those sectors charged with leading Britain's rebalancing towards an export-led economy, notably manufacturers and professional services firms, were more likely to value language skills. Former German chancellor Willy Brandt perhaps best summed up the advantages of speaking another language when he said: \"If I'm selling to you, I speak your language. If I'm buying, dann m\u00fcssen Sie Deutsch sprechen [then you have to speak German].\" British businesses appear all too aware of this. In a 2012 survey by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), 61% of non-exporters that were likely to consider trading internationally said a lack of language skills was a barrier. The BCC has supported a \"manifesto for languages\" devised by the all-party parliamentary group on modern languages (APPG), which wants all political parties to push for more language teaching by schools and employers. The manifesto begins: \"English is an important world language, but the latest cutting-edge research shows that, in the 21st century, speaking only English is as much of a disadvantage as speaking no English.\" It cites an estimate that the UK stands to lose \u00a348bn a year, or 3.5% of GDP, because of linguistic and cultural ignorance, a figure calculated for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills by Professor James Foreman-Peck at Cardiff Business School. Of course, it would be a sad world in which people learn the language, literature and history of others merely for monetary gain. But as competition grows and new markets emerge, economic factors are gaining importance in debates on foreign-language teaching and are shaping policy. When primary schools reopen this week, foreign languages will be compulsory for the first time. Only time will tell whether this change helps dismantle Britons' reputation as lousy linguists. Yet surely a move towards multilingualism is a step in the right direction. For Attali, France \"can and should rely on its linguistic assets to return to a path of sustainable growth\". But gone are the colonial days when European countries can hope to spread their languages around the world and make increasing gains from them. French speakers and francophiles will continue to provide some life support to the ailing economy. France was the world's top tourist destination last year with almost 85 million visitors. Yet that influx did little to fan anaemic economic growth. Francophilophonie is a tempting concept for a president in trouble. But France's problems are too big to solve with a few more Chinese shoppers, British campers and overseas Camembert sales.",

      "bodyText": "If Pfizer executives want to know how to pull off the acquisition of a British drug maker, they should visit a nondescript 1980s office block in Slough. It would be a worthwhile visit for the US drugs firm, which is allowed to resurrect its \u00a369bn interest in UK rival AstraZeneca after an embargo imposed by the Takeover Panel expired last week. The Slough building houses a laboratory once operated by Celltech, formerly the UK's largest biotechnology firm and now a unit of UCB, a Belgian family firm best known for its Zyrtec anti-hayfever pill. It is proof that a foreign pharmaceuticals business can launch a raid on these shores and avoid the political and public scorn that squashed the AstraZeneca bid. Ten years ago, UCB achieved Pfizer's ambition of acquiring a British industrial champion, which sparked the usual fears over job losses. Hailed by Tony Blair as one of the \"giants of British biotechnology\", Celltech, founded in 1980, disappeared from the public market. A key reason why New York-based Pfizer failed in its attempt to take over AstraZeneca in May was that it underestimated the furore over the likely loss of thousands of research jobs and the knock-on effects on British science. Under Takeover Panel rules, it could return with a higher offer if it is invited back to the negotiating table by AstraZeneca after a 90-day waiting period expired last week. However, Astra's opposition to a deal makes that unlikely \u2013 even if Pfizer is allowed to make a phone call to AstraZeneca to make a single offer and the shares have risen nearly 12% in the past fortnight on speculation of a new bid. So investors will pay closer attention in late November, when an embargo on any new bids from Pfizer is lifted entirely and the US group is allowed to make a public, even hostile, approach. Today the former Celltech lab in Slough boasts a brand new suite of automated equipment, including a 20kg robot that has halved the time it takes to screen antibodies. Medicines based on antibodies, which are produced by the body's immune system to fight infection, now see the fastest growth in pharmaceuticals sales. Following the \u00a31.5bn acquisition of the FTSE 100 company, UCB kept the lab open \u2013 it now houses about 400 scientists \u2013 and made it its global centre for research and development (R&amp;D). It is focused on immunology drugs, which use the body's immune system to tackle illness. The company, owned by Belgium's Janssen family, prides itself on being one of the biggest foreign investors in UK life sciences, having ploughed \u00a31.2bn into research in the UK over the last decade. It recently spent $5.5m (\u00a33.3m) on upgrading its antibody discovery equipment in Slough, including the new robot. Similar to the ones used on a car assembly line, it has been scaled up to handle plates with cell cultures, halving screening time to two to three months. This is where Cimzia \u2013 Celltech's leading product \u2013 was developed: a synthetic antibody that treats rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Pfizer, incidentally, played a role in ending Celltech's independence: by pulling out of a partnership agreement to develop the drug, it drove Celltech into the arms of its bigger suitor in 2004. The reaction to the takeover was relatively muted, even though it crushed hopes that Celltech would emulate the success of America's Amgen and Genentech (the latter was bought by Roche but kept as an autonomous division which has outshone its Swiss parent). Paul Cuddon, healthcare and life sciences analyst at Peel Hunt, says: \"Biopharmaceutical success stories in the UK have been so rare that when companies do well, their shareholders have often needed to take profits \u2013 namely Celltech, Acambis, ProStrakan. Our best and brightest companies often get sold off prematurely.\" Cuddon adds that AstraZeneca's victory in its battle to stay independent, as well as the recent stock-market fundraisings by a host of small British biotech firms \u2013 BTG, Circassia, Vectura, SkyePharma and Horizon Discovery \u2013 suggest that \"the UK market is coming round to funding Britain's best companies for longer\". But a sense of siege prevails. AstraZeneca is not out of the woods yet and another FTSE 100 company \u2013 Shire, founded in Basingstoke in 1986 and known for its anti-hyperactivity drugs \u2013 has just succumbed to a \u00a332bn takeover by Chicago-based Abbvie. The battle was far less emotive because Shire had already moved its HQ to Dublin for tax reasons, shifted its R&amp;D to the US and was only employing 500 people in the UK. UCB, for its part, shied away from the \"slash and burn\" approach adopted by other big players in the industry. Pfizer laid off thousands of people after each of its past acquisitions and shut the bulk of its lab in Sandwich, Kent three years ago, leading to more than 1,500 job losses. When UK vaccine maker Acambis was sold to its longstanding collaborator, France's Sanofi, in 2008 for \u00a3276m, Sanofi sold its Cambridge site. In 2012 Sanofi closed Genzyme's lab in Cambridge with the loss of 60 jobs after acquiring the US biotech firm for $20bn, leaving the French company with no R&amp;D jobs in the UK. While UCB shut Celltech's smaller Cambridge lab, some scientists transferred to Slough, and in the following years the company hired more. At the time of the acquisition, Celltech employed 470 people in Britain; today UCB employs 700 people (mainly scientists) in the UK and Ireland. UCB's treatment romosozumab for post-menopausal osteoporosis, which is in late-stage clinical trials, was developed in Slough, after a rare gene that creates bone was discovered in a small Afrikaans population in South Africa. UCB recently used crowdsourcing to find people with unusal genetic make-up that could form the basis of new medicines, and will follow up with people who have a congenital insensitivity to pain and others who heal quickly. Another shining example is the \u00a3292m acquisition of Scottish biotech firm ProStrakan by Japan's Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK) in 2011. Since then, the Borders-based firm has seen revenues and profits soar and staff numbers in Galashiels rise by 50% to 110 people. A decade ago, American conglomerate General Electric bought UK medical diagnostics firm Amersham and combined it with its medical systems arm to form GE Healthcare, still based in Buckinghamshire \u2013 the first GE business to be headquartered outside the US. The $18bn company provides technology and services to the NHS and employs 2,700 people in the UK, about a third of whom work in R&amp;D. UCB's chief executive Roch Doliveux, who steps down in January 2015 after 10 years at the helm, is sceptical about big mergers. \"We are an industry where innovation and size do not go well together,\" he says. \"Large companies are not more productive; in fact large companies are less productive. The key is stay small and focus.\" Pfizer admitted that a takeover of AstraZeneca would lead to big cuts in the R&amp;D budget and the number of scientists employed by the merged company. Its pledge to keep 20% of the combined workforce in Britain for five years was not enough for Astra and the UK government. As Mike Ingram of BGC Partners puts it: \"Twenty per cent of nothing is still nothing.\" If Pfizer wants to have another tilt at AstraZeneca, it needs to come up with better guarantees \u2013 especially if UK business secretary Vince Cable makes good on his promise to introduce multimillion-pound penalties for foreign firms that break commitments.",

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow morning Dave Lewis will start his new job as chief executive of Tesco. His task: to lead the mother of all turnarounds despite never having run a retailer before \u2013 let alone Britain's biggest. The business is in a mess, sales are falling, staff morale is low and shoppers have fallen out of love with the brand, increasingly tempted by the charms of the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. The urgency is evident: Lewis was parachuted in just 48 hours after leaving Unilever. As he'll have had little time to review his plans, we asked a group of retail experts to give him some help. CLIVE BLACK Shore Capital It's all about the UK. If Tesco doesn't get it right here, it will never be successful again. Price has to be right at the top of the agenda. I don't think it needs shock and awe, but some prices on the basics \u2013 like bread and milk, fresh foods \u2013 have to match Aldi and Lidl. Some it doesn't matter. Dave Lewis needs to cut prices in an intelligent and sane way. He has to simplify the customer proposition \u2013 make promotions less complicated, edit the range and reassess the value of Clubcard and Price Promise. Once he's got a more simple price proposition he can go on the front foot and highlight things the competition doesn't have: like online, proprietary brands and non-food. While price remains an issue, none of that is going to work. It's also fundamental to upgrade store standards. The shops have to be clean, bright and have strong availability. Staff have to be motivated. He has got to put customers before anybody else. There is also a fundamental need to reappraise the cost base, particularly at head office: jobs need to go. Those cost savings need to be ploughed back into the customer proposition. STEVE DRESSER Grocery Insight Dave Lewis needs to start with the stores. Tesco has become obsessed with saving money and that's OK, but you can't cost-save your way to prosperity. It has been cutting overtime and staffing hours, and stores don't have enough people around. That's upsetting customers, even loyal ones, and while competition is so fierce, with rival stores everywhere, you don't need to give people a reason to go anywhere else. Not enough staff means poor store standards. Availability is an ongoing issue. Cleanliness has gone out of the window in some stores and fruit and veg quality is not as sharp as it should be \u2013 and that's down to people not checking it regularly. Phil Clarke went down the route of tarting up the big Extra stores with no discernible effect on sales. They don't want to go down that route. It's possible Dave Lewis could sell off Giraffe and Harris + Hoole, the restaurant and coffee shop chains Clarke invested in. Tesco's prices need to come down on more than just 60 or 70 lines. Pricing is particularly high in the Express stores, where it tends to start towards the top of the range. There is an acceptance among shoppers that there will be a price premium in return for the convenience but Sainsbury's manages to make it less obvious. Meanwhile the Express stores are very utilitarian. They don't have many people serving there and a lot of it is packaged goods. With so many people now experiencing the Express stores, that can have a big impact on their impression of Tesco's brand. Branding is a big issue. People just don't like the company. They didn't particularly like it in the days of Sir Terry Leahy but at least it was cheap. Now it is viewed as a bully in local areas, where it is pushing for convenience stores, and the brand is known for everything else but food. MAUREEN HINTON Conlumino Dave Lewis's first priority should be Christmas, the most important part of the year. He needs to find a good way of getting across that Tesco is worth shopping at because of its wide range, value and services like online and delivery. He needs to ensure not only that Tesco is offering value to customers across the board, but that the value message is conveyed clearly, with a distinct price positioning across all its products, not just promotions or limited ranges. He also needs to rationalise the store numbers and ranges. There is just too much space. Tesco doesn't need so many big out-of-town stores, so Lewis needs to think what he is going to do with them. He also needs to rationalise the ranges. There seem to be hundreds of different types of olive oil, for example. They are never going to sell any of them in great depth. Being the market leader, Tesco should be able to offer value through scale but it is losing that advantage with such a width of range. Lewis needs to make customers love Tesco by improving its image, service and interaction with local communities. LORD MACLAURIN Tesco's former chairman Dave Lewis is a very capable man and, coming from the manufacturing side, he is going to have a really good look at all sides of the business. The retail trade is highly competitive and he has to look in great detail at what he wants to do. He needs to find the finest marketing man he could possibly get, with a good background in strategy and knowledge of the business. BRUNO MONTEYNE Bernstein Research Tesco's biggest problem is that it is trying to do everything with one kind of store. That was fine 10 years ago but today most people have more choice. If people want to save money they say 'why should I got to Tesco, because I can go to Aldi and Lidl?'. If they want quality and service they can go to Waitrose. The value players can only offer cheap food because they have low costs. Cheap prices don't go together with the Clubcard, promotions like Fuel Save and the widest range in the sector. The major risk of tit-for-tat price cuts is that each price cut is followed by a cut in costs. If Tesco follows three years of price and cost cuts it will look like a bad copy of Aldi and Lidl. All the affluent shoppers will leave. Tesco needs to create the right environment to cut prices. It could create different retail experiences, like different brands: one group of stores for value and one for affluent areas. Tesco has 300 stores in deprived areas. It could rip out 25% of the range, take out Clubcard and cut prices by 10% and really take on Aldi and Lidl there. It could do the opposite in central London and places like Cambridge or Edinburgh. There it could go for a quality environment and charge more. A SOURCE CLOSE TO TESCO One of Dave Lewis's top priorities should be getting talent back into the business. Phil Clarke lost maybe two or three generations of top talent below board level. A lot of people with a point of view and the ability to get on with things have left. In the past Tesco's biggest challenge was not the cash to do things but how to have enough talent to run all the businesses, from the chain in Hungary to online. The dearth of talent is now a huge challenge. The culture has also been badly affected. What was a team effort became all about Clarke. I think Lewis is equipped for that, as he seems a thoughtful and caring person. I think we'll see the return of some humility to Tesco, which it could certainly use. Lewis's great advantage is that he is going to be looking at everything fresh. He has also got to face into the nonsense. He needs to take a close look at the business in Europe and some of the sideshows \u2013 like Blinkbox, which is losing millions of pounds a year. The company is spending far too much on digital projects. There needs to be a bonfire of the vanity projects. Clarke has also created a behemoth of a head office and staff numbers need to be tackled, while more investment needs to go into stores.",
