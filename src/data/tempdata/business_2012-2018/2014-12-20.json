      "body": "<p>Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old high school senior, faced a camera in the fluorescent-lit offices of his press representatives and told an audience of strangers that his father wasn\u2019t speaking to him: \u201cMy dad\u2019s always told me to be truthful and I went against everything he said. I can\u2019t even express how I can\u2019t speak properly to him any more\u201d. </p> <p>Two years earlier, Islam had told a well-known stock trader that he wanted to break into finance to help his family. Now his family was ashamed of him. <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/exclusive-new-york-mags-boy-genius-investor-made-it-all-up/\">He told a reporter</a>, \u201cmy dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she\u2019d never talk to me. They ... basically wanted to kill me and I haven\u2019t spoken to them since\u201d.</p> <p>Two days earlier, Islam\u2019s name had gone viral. A New York Magazine profile of him in the magazine\u2019s \u201cReasons to Love New York\u201d issue presented him as a financial whiz kid, with a BMW he was not yet old enough to drive and a multimillion-dollar apartment his parents wouldn\u2019t let him move to; a search of his name linked to the word \u201ctrading\u201d still returns over 100,000 Google results, including articles in publications as diverse as the Latin Post and E! Online. The fame turned to notoriety fast. </p> <p>When his lies crashed down around him, Islam was sitting with a friend in a black car hired to take them to the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey headquarters of the financial news network CNBC. Islam and his high school buddy, Damir Tulemaganbetov, were going there to tell the story of how Islam made millions of dollars in the stock market \u2013 a story that had already been told in the pages of the Stuyvesant High School Spectator, Business Insider and most importantly, New York Magazine. </p> <p>When CNBC called, Islam and his friend had been riding high on the adulation that resulted from profiles and dozens of media stories about Islam\u2019s trading prowess; he later said: \u201cwe were both excited by the attention given by the media hype\u201d. Islam, the working-class child of immigrants, was getting the respect he had hoped for since he was an insecure 15-year-old looking to break into trading, hoping it would help his family and win him admiration. </p> <p>But Islam\u2019s story was falling apart \u2013 fast. The same reporter from Business Insider who had first featured Islam in the publication\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/20-under-20-in-finance-2013-11\">\u201920 under 20\u2019 </a>feature called the kids in the car. She wanted more facts. She <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mohammed-islam-high-school-trader-2014-12\">hammered Tulemaganbetov with questions</a>: did Islam have proof of his trades? Did he have details on his investments? </p> <p>None were forthcoming. Tulemaganbetov refused, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mohammed-islam-72-m-rumor-2014-12\">insisting he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d Islam is \u201ca great trader\u201d and a \u201cgenius</a>\u201d who deserved the hype. Tulemaganbetov walked back the claim that Islam had made $72m, but still insisted that his friend earned a fortune. His confidence hid considerable anxiety: the call left Islam and Tulemaganbetov rattled. They were 15 minutes late to CNBC, and by the time they got there, a source says the kids were nervous \u2013 so much so, in fact, that another source says they didn\u2019t want to get out of the car. </p> <p>Eventually a CNBC producer escorted the kids into the building and to the office of CNBC editor-in-chief Nik Deogun, a former top editor at the Wall Street Journal. Deogun started peppering the kids with questions: how much money was involved, the initial strategy, details of the stocks and other trades. Islam described a strategy that ranged from penny stocks to options and the most arcane products on Wall Street: derivatives. Islam, visibly nervous, did most of the talking, according to a source familiar with the conversation. </p> <p>Deogun asked: \u201cIt\u2019s not $72m, is it?\u201d Islam acknowledged it wasn\u2019t and said he didn\u2019t know where the number came from. Deogun then presented an option to the teenagers, according to a source familiar with the conversation, giving the kids a warning to the effect of: \u201cYou cannot lie on our air ... eventually, it\u2019s going to come out. We\u2019re going to ask you tough questions and just know you can\u2019t lie\u201d. Then Deogun asked them if they still wanted to go on the show. </p> <p>Islam and Tulemaganbetov asked for time to confer privately in another office. Islam appeared \u201cterrified\u201d, said a source familiar with the scene. When they returned to speak to Deogun, they decided to back out. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fbe059114df5283b41f5ec93f46f6f4cddd5283\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418922831588/fc57baf6-e874-437c-a57a-69185eb24be6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"CNBC\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CNBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The drama, however, was not over. While they were still in the building, CNBC reporter Scott Wapner came over and quizzed the kids about whether Islam made eight figures, as the rumor had it. Islam admitted to something more in the range of $3m. Wapner reported on air that Islam was backing away from his claims. The same source familiar with conversation said that the visibly distressed Islam gave a strong impression of being in over his head. </p> <p>The CNBC episode set off a subsequent battery of public questions as skeptics piled up. What came out later revealed that the young man, apparently looking for attention and approval, had been building for years a string of lies about Wall Street prowess.</p> <p>Islam later said he\u2019d made it all up, agreeing with the New York Observer that his trading gains were \u201ctotal fiction\u201d. \u201cI pretended to be something I\u2019m not and I\u2019m extremely sorry\u201d, he said in an apology in which he said he had only done simulated trading. </p> <p>\u201cSeventeen-year-old boys don\u2019t always tell the truth. Is that a mystery to anyone, whether they are a reporter or not?\u201d Ronn Torossian, a spokesman for Islam and Tulemaganbetov, told the Guardian.</p> <h2>The allure of wealth</h2> <p>The accounting of Islam\u2019s embellishments, however, was more extensive than the usual puffery of adolescence. Even before the fake BMW, the nonexistent multimillion-dollar apartment, and the fake bank statements that Islam created for the benefit of New York Magazine, he had a history of making claims that seem fantastical in retrospect.</p> <p>Islam first burst into the spotlight when he was profiled as a boy-wonder trader by Business Insider and named one of its<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/20-under-20-in-finance-2013-11#\"> \u201820 under 20\u2019</a>, an honor for which Islam had been <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mohammed-islam-72-m-rumor-2014-12\">nominated by his peers</a>. </p> <p>The Business Insider piece led to another, longer profile by the newspaper at Islam\u2019s elite New York City high school, Stuyvesant, a public magnet school, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_laureates_by_secondary_school_affiliation\">which counts among its alumni four Nobel Prize winners</a>. </p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://issuu.com/stuyspectator/docs/volume_104__issue_6/13\">profiled in the Stuyvesant Spectator with the headline \u201cGolden Boy\u201d</a>, Islam told a classmate-reporter that he started trading penny stocks at 11 under the tutelage of a cousin who worked at Goldman Sachs. (Islam later told New York Magazine that he started trading at 9 years old). He furnished numbers to the Spectator reporter: he made $1,000 to $2,000 every day by trading during lunch breaks and at night, he claimed, and fended off job offers of $9,000 to $12,000 a month. </p> <p>He invented a chimerical portfolio and trading expertise, which covered three asset classes \u2013 from stocks to oil and gold futures \u2013 with dollops of jargon about two different strategies. He told the Spectator that he made simulated trades for eight months before jumping into the stock market during middle school \u201cwith money he had saved from tutoring,\u201d the paper wrote.</p> <p>The teenager, if his tale were true, would be accomplishing something few adults could: he seemed to be a one-man hedge fund at the least and possibly a child prodigy, the Mozart of trading. It was a difficult-to-dismiss possibility in the halls of Stuyvesant, where unusually bright teenagers are thick on the ground and kids win national recognition for research alongside adult professionals on mysteries including \u201c<a href=\"http://stuy.enschool.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=126655&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=268716\">erythroid differentiation through a non-autophagic cellular mechanism</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps because of this, it appears no one fully checked every one of Islam\u2019s claims. His fibs seemed to grow even faster than his ambitions. </p> <p>His story included not just wins, but plausible losses. \u201cI once lost $1,400 in a day and I got really scared,\u201d <a href=\"http://issuu.com/stuyspectator/docs/volume_104__issue_6/13\">he told The Spectator</a>. \u201cSo I spoke to some of my friends and they told me to chill.\u201d The way the story has it, that was the end of his trading with penny stocks and his move into oil and gold futures. </p> <p>Islam also told the Stuyvesant reporter that his father was out of work, and that his trading helped the family. But later, as his reputation and his story grew, Islam told a professional reporter that he traded stocks and commodities under his father\u2019s account. He spun a tale that his father was an experienced trader who focused on \u201calgorithmic trading\u201d and \u201cbelieves in mathematical models\u201d. </p> <p>In his final admission, Islam reversed the story, and said<a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/exclusive-new-york-mags-boy-genius-investor-made-it-all-up/\"> that no one in his family was interested in finance</a>. Islam and his family <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/exclusive-follow-up-interview-with-boy-genius-stock-picker-wonders-why/\">live in a two-bedroom apartment in Queens</a>, he said. </p> <p>Islam\u2019s tales, though outlandish in retrospect, by all accounts raised very little suspicion among his classmates and teachers. Islam later fended off reporters with bogus bank statements and other falsehoods; even his public relations man appeared to believe or at least paper over some of his fibs. </p> <p>Ronn Torossian, a public relations advisor who managed the press for both Islam and Tulemaganbetov, initially wrote to the Guardian that Islam never furnished official documents to New York Magazine, as the publication claimed: \u201cmy client maintains that there were never bank statements of any sort shown to any reporter\u201d. </p> <p>But Islam himself recounted a slightly different tale. Islam told the New York Observer <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/how-the-72-million-kid-duped-new-york-magazine/\">that he had purposely misled New York Magazine with fake bank documents: \u201cI showed them what they wanted to see\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/16/high-school-senior-who-claimed-fake-72m-fortune-releases-video-apology\">It\u2019s a thin line\u201d</a> between official bank statements and a \u201cpiece of paper,\u201d Torossian later told the Guardian by way of squaring the contradiction between his statement and that of his client.</p> <p>Tulemaganbetov, who New York Magazine described as the son of a Kazakh oligarch, is the one who helped project the aura of wealth during the boys\u2019 meetings with the New York magazine reporter, paying a combined $600 for the two meals, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/how-the-72-million-kid-duped-new-york-magazine/\">according to the New York Observer</a>. </p> <p>Torossian declined multiple requests to make Islam available. The Business Insider reporter did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The New York Magazine reporter referred requests for comment to a spokesperson, who <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/apology-to-our-readers.html\">referred the Guardian to a statement</a> saying the magazine was \u201cduped\u201d and added, \u201cour fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Islam\u2019s stories carried so far likely reflect the fervent will to believe of a teenager desperate to improve his circumstances, and who diligently studied trading as a way out and fantasized about a better life \u2013 but without enough money to actually start making significant bets. The stories Islam told classmates, friends and reporters seemed to reflect the person he wanted to be in the future but \u2013 crucially \u2013 was not in the present. </p> <p>While the Guardian has not been able to confirm the existence of the cousin at Goldman Sachs, who apparently got Islam interested in the stock market, it has tracked Islam\u2019s more open interest in the stock market. The tales that followed traced the anatomy of a story that swept the national media. </p> <p>The first evidence of Islam\u2019s interest in trading dates to July 2012. It was then that Islam <a href=\"http://www.timothysykes.com/2014/12/calling-teen-wolf-wall-street-mohammed-islam-claims-made-72-million/\">emailed Timothy Sykes</a>, a young investor who trains others, asking Sykes to consider him for one of his courses.</p> <p>Sykes, who claims to have turned $12,000 of his bar mitzvah money into $1.65m in four years, hand-picks candidates for his \u201ctrading challenge\u201d \u2013 a course in which he shares his experience with the stock market and has the candidates apply it in real time. There is just one catch: Sykes doesn\u2019t work with people who are dependent on the money they are looking to invest.</p> <p>\u201cI get emails like this everyday, [people] wanting to learn. There is nothing wrong with wanting to learn, but basically he wanted to learn and in his application to us he said he needs the money to basically live,\u201d Sykes told the Guardian. </p> <p>Sykes refused to take Islam as a student: \u201cI don\u2019t teach people who have that little money because their mindset isn\u2019t right. They are trying to make $500 to $1,000 so that they can pay the next month\u2019s rent and that\u2019s not how you become a real, successful trader,\u201d explains Sykes.</p> <p>Islam was persistent. Despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t accepted for Sykes\u2019 trading challenge, Islam continued to request guidance about proper tools and software through <a href=\"http://www.timothysykes.com/\">Sykes\u2019 website</a>. Sykes says he believes the questions reflected Islam\u2019s inexperience.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have made $72m or even $7.2m or even $720,000, you wouldn\u2019t be asking for that\u201d, Sykes says.</p> <p>In his application for Sykes\u2019 challenge, seen by the Guardian, Islam wrote that he wanted to improve his financial situation to help take care of his family, that he wanted people to look at him differently.</p> <p>While Islam\u2019s stories of a fabulous life never held up, there was one thing that he seems to have been telling the truth about all along: he loves the stock market, or at least the idea of what it can do.</p> <p>The application portrays Islam as someone who \u201cwants to learn, somebody who wants to be a great trader, somebody who wants to do his family proud,\u201d says Sykes.</p> <p>Islam and Tulemaganbetov maintain a positive outlook, according to their most recent interview with the New York Observer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good, what we did. But we are still inspired. We still want to pursue doing business together as individuals\u201d, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/12/how-the-72-million-kid-duped-new-york-magazine/#ixzz3MBxjmLGA\">Tulemaganbetov told The Observer</a>. \u201cWe still want to be successful and make money and make our parents proud. And I think if they were to make a movie about this, it would be about the end, not the beginning\u201d.</p> <p>Others are not so sure that movie ends well. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge black mark on the internet with his name,\u201d says Sykes. \u201cEverybody in finance, they\u2019ll remember the name Mohammed Islam \u2013 and they won\u2019t remember it in a good way.\u201d </p> <p>On Wall Street, however, several traders argued that an ability to bluff, along with a passion to make money, are the elements of a successful trader, and wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Islam could one day reach his ambitions. </p> <p>Whatever happens, it\u2019s hard to believe Islam\u2019s future will be boring. He told the Stuyvesant Spectator that his favorite part of trading was the lack of monotony. \u201cMy favorite part of this entire institute is risk\u201d, he told his classmate. \u201cEvery day is an exciting experience and you never get used to it. It\u2019s an exciting day, every day\u201d. </p> <h2><br></h2>",

The allure of wealth The accounting of Islam\u2019s embellishments, however, was more extensive than the usual puffery of adolescence. Even before the fake BMW, the nonexistent multimillion-dollar apartment, and the fake bank statements that Islam created for the benefit of New York Magazine, he had a history of making claims that seem fantastical in retrospect. Islam first burst into the spotlight when he was profiled as a boy-wonder trader by Business Insider and named one of its \u201820 under 20\u2019, an honor for which Islam had been nominated by his peers. The Business Insider piece led to another, longer profile by the newspaper at Islam\u2019s elite New York City high school, Stuyvesant, a public magnet school, which counts among its alumni four Nobel Prize winners. In 2013, profiled in the Stuyvesant Spectator with the headline \u201cGolden Boy\u201d, Islam told a classmate-reporter that he started trading penny stocks at 11 under the tutelage of a cousin who worked at Goldman Sachs.

Islam\u2019s tales, though outlandish in retrospect, by all accounts raised very little suspicion among his classmates and teachers. Islam later fended off reporters with bogus bank statements and other falsehoods; even his public relations man appeared to believe or at least paper over some of his fibs. Ronn Torossian, a public relations advisor who managed the press for both Islam and Tulemaganbetov, initially wrote to the Guardian that Islam never furnished official documents to New York Magazine, as the publication claimed: \u201cmy client maintains that there were never bank statements of any sort shown to any reporter\u201d. But Islam himself recounted a slightly different tale. Islam told the New York Observer that he had purposely misled New York Magazine with fake bank documents: \u201cI showed them what they wanted to see\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a thin line\u201d between official bank statements and a \u201cpiece of paper,\u201d Torossian later told the Guardian by way of squaring the contradiction between his statement and that of his client. Tulemaganbetov, who New York Magazine described as the son of a Kazakh oligarch, is the one who helped project the aura of wealth during the boys\u2019 meetings with the New York magazine reporter, paying a combined $600 for the two meals, according to the New York Observer. Torossian declined multiple requests to make Islam available. The Business Insider reporter did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The New York Magazine reporter referred requests for comment to a spokesperson, who referred the Guardian to a statement saying the magazine was \u201cduped\u201d and added, \u201cour fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better.\u201d The fact that Islam\u2019s stories carried so far likely reflect the fervent will to believe of a teenager desperate to improve his circumstances, and who diligently studied trading as a way out and fantasized about a better life \u2013 but without enough money to actually start making significant bets. The stories Islam told classmates, friends and reporters seemed to reflect the person he wanted to be in the future but \u2013 crucially \u2013 was not in the present. While the Guardian has not been able to confirm the existence of the cousin at Goldman Sachs, who apparently got Islam interested in the stock market, it has tracked Islam\u2019s more open interest in the stock market. The tales that followed traced the anatomy of a story that swept the national media. The first evidence of Islam\u2019s interest in trading dates to July 2012. It was then that Islam emailed Timothy Sykes, a young investor who trains others, asking Sykes to consider him for one of his courses. Sykes, who claims to have turned $12,000 of his bar mitzvah money into $1.65m in four years, hand-picks candidates for his \u201ctrading challenge\u201d \u2013 a course in which he shares his experience with the stock market and has the candidates apply it in real time. There is just one catch: Sykes doesn\u2019t work with people who are dependent on the money they are looking to invest. \u201cI get emails like this everyday, [people] wanting to learn. There is nothing wrong with wanting to learn, but basically he wanted to learn and in his application to us he said he needs the money to basically live,\u201d Sykes told the Guardian. Sykes refused to take Islam as a student: \u201cI don\u2019t teach people who have that little money because their mindset isn\u2019t right. They are trying to make $500 to $1,000 so that they can pay the next month\u2019s rent and that\u2019s not how you become a real, successful trader,\u201d explains Sykes. Islam was persistent. Despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t accepted for Sykes\u2019 trading challenge, Islam continued to request guidance about proper tools and software through Sykes\u2019 website. Sykes says he believes the questions reflected Islam\u2019s inexperience. \u201cIf you have made $72m or even $7.2m or even $720,000, you wouldn\u2019t be asking for that\u201d, Sykes says. In his application for Sykes\u2019 challenge, seen by the Guardian, Islam wrote that he wanted to improve his financial situation to help take care of his family, that he wanted people to look at him differently. While Islam\u2019s stories of a fabulous life never held up, there was one thing that he seems to have been telling the truth about all along: he loves the stock market, or at least the idea of what it can do. The application portrays Islam as someone who \u201cwants to learn, somebody who wants to be a great trader, somebody who wants to do his family proud,\u201d says Sykes. Islam and Tulemaganbetov maintain a positive outlook, according to their most recent interview with the New York Observer. \u201cIt\u2019s not good, what we did. But we are still inspired. We still want to pursue doing business together as individuals\u201d, Tulemaganbetov told The Observer. \u201cWe still want to be successful and make money and make our parents proud. And I think if they were to make a movie about this, it would be about the end, not the beginning\u201d. Others are not so sure that movie ends well. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge black mark on the internet with his name,\u201d says Sykes. \u201cEverybody in finance, they\u2019ll remember the name Mohammed Islam \u2013 and they won\u2019t remember it in a good way.\u201d On Wall Street, however, several traders argued that an ability to bluff, along with a passion to make money, are the elements of a successful trader, and wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Islam could one day reach his ambitions. Whatever happens, it\u2019s hard to believe Islam\u2019s future will be boring. He told the Stuyvesant Spectator that his favorite part of trading was the lack of monotony. \u201cMy favorite part of this entire institute is risk\u201d, he told his classmate. \u201cEvery day is an exciting experience and you never get used to it. It\u2019s an exciting day, every day\u201d.",
