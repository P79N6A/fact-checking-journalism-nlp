      "bodyText": "George Osborne has vowed to confront anxieties over Chinese involvement in Britain\u2019s nuclear energy sector after announcing a \u00a32bn government guarantee for the delayed and controversial Hinkley Point power plant project in Somerset. Speaking in Beijing on the second day of his five-day tour of China, the chancellor said the project in south-west England was \u201ca win-win-win for the UK and \u2026 a great example of how the relationship with China has a direct material benefit to the people living in our country\u201d. \u201cI think we have to confront any anxieties that exist out there about Chinese investment in British civil nuclear power,\u201d Osborne told a press conference in Beijing. The initial backing from the British government would pave the way for the construction of Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station for a generation, Osborne said, as he redoubled his arguments for nuclear in the face of opposition from environmental groups. Addressing concerns over Chinese involvement, Osborne said: \u201cThe truth is this: the reactor \u2013 which is actually a French reactor \u2013 can only go ahead if it is signed off by our nuclear safety experts and there are plenty of rules that exist to protect the British people from the misuse of civil nuclear power and to make sure that our nuclear power stations are completely safe. \u201cFor me personally, it is a tragedy that for two decades we gave up on building these nuclear power stations. This government is determined to get back into building nuclear power stations. We are going to secure reliable low-carbon energy for the future. But instead of me committing tens of billions of pounds of British taxpayers\u2019 money to these nuclear power stations \u2013 which is money I would otherwise be able to spend on the health service or the education system or indeed give lower taxes to people \u2013 instead of that we have created a model where we can attract Chinese investment into civil nuclear power.\u201d Osborne said Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point \u201copens the door for majority Chinese ownership of a subsequently nuclear project in Bradwell.\u201d London and Beijing had also agreed to set up a \u201ccutting-edge\u201d \u00a350m nuclear research centre, the chancellor announced. The Hinkley plans have been beset by problems and the plant\u2019s developer, EDF, the French energy group, recently admitted it may be further delayed. Amid concerns over when Chinese backers will commit investment to the plan, the project has come under intensifying criticism from the energy industry and the City. Analysts have questioned the economics of a project that, at \u00a324.5bn, could cost as much as the combined bill for Crossrail, the London 2012 Olympics and the revamped Terminal 2 at Heathrow. But there has been no sign of the government wavering in its commitment. EDF has already won a generous financial aid package from the government through its \u201ccontract for difference\u201d mechanism but has yet to sign the definitive deal it needs with Beijing investors. The Treasury said Osborne\u2019s announcement of an initial government guarantee for the project would smooth the path to a final investment decision by EDF, supported by China General Nuclear corporation and China National Nuclear corporation. A breakthrough is expected when the Chinese premier visits the UK next month, leaving EDF in a position to finally give the green light to the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK for 20 years. The government hopes the construction and operation of Hinkley Point C will create thousands of jobs in Somerset and more widely in the nuclear industry across the UK, as well as boosting Britain\u2019s energy security. The new plant is expected to produce enough energy to supply 7% of the country\u2019s needs, powering around 6m homes, the Treasury said. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said Osborne\u2019s approval of an infrastructure guarantee was a \u201cclear sign\u201d of the government\u2019s commitment to Hinkley Point C. \u201cIt is further progress towards a final investment decision on a project which will provide reliable, affordable low-carbon electricity for decades,\u201d he added. Last week, three leading environmentalists who broke ranks to give their support to a new generation of nuclear plants joined together to urge the government to scrap plans for Hinkley Point C. George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall said the soaring cost of, and delays to, the Hinkley project left ministers with no option but to pour the estimated \u00a324.5bn-worth of investment into other low-carbon technologies. Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said: \u201cThis announcement is a PR smokescreen to give the impression that this project is moving forward when it\u2019s actually bogged down in a swamp of troubles. Hinkley hasn\u2019t got funding or safety clearance, and everyone outside the nuclear industry and our blinkered government thinks it\u2019s absurd, yet the chancellor is ignoring them all to plough ahead with this overpriced, overrated and overtime project.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has urged Chinese leaders to press on with economic reforms as he played down fears that China\u2019s recent stock market turmoil and economic slowdown will endanger the global economy. Last month\u2019s stock market meltdown and disappointing economic data from China have fuelled concerns that the world\u2019s second largest economy is slowing faster than its government is letting on. However, speaking on Sunday the chancellor insisted that even with its economy slowing, China would continue to be \u201ca massive source of growth going forward\u201d. \u201cChina is undergoing a very important economic transformation - a transformation that its government wants to see [and] that its people want to see - from that investment-led economy of the past to a consumption-led economy of the future. And of course when that happens you are going to find that challenging. It is a big change,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cBut put it in perspective. The Chinese economy is forecast to grow over the next five years in such a way that it will add to the world economy an economy the size of the United Kingdom at least. So the growth in the Chinese economy will be more than the entire British economy at least in the coming five years.\u201d Speaking on the first day of a five-day tour of China, Osborne sent a message to his Communist party hosts, who are grappling with how to manage their country\u2019s economic transition while avoiding a hard landing. \u201cWhen you look at what China is doing at the moment, I think that the message that I would say to China is: \u2018Carry on with the reform, carry on with the change you are making,\u2019\u201d Osborne said. \u201cIt will be of course challenging - it can\u2019t be anything other than challenging when you\u2019ve got the world\u2019s second largest economy and you\u2019ve got 1.3 billion people who are undergoing this big change \u2026 so you do get things like movements on stock markets. \u201cBut it is important to keep our eye on the bigger picture as well - on the bigger prize - that this period of economic reform can lay the foundations for Chinese prosperity for decades to come. So we are very support of the economic reforms that the Chinese government has talked about and are now starting to [put into practice].\u201d Chinese authorities face the challenge of reforming the country\u2019s vast economy away from over-dependence on investment and exports and towards more domestic, household consumption. They are also seeking to gradually take the heat out of overvalued property and share prices. Reforms have included moves to rein in debt-fuelled investment, from large infrastructure projects to individuals buying property and speculating on the stock market. But the International Monetary Fund warned recently that further structural reforms will be needed to make the Chinese economy more open, and it urged China to press on with plans to move to a more market-based financial system, to reform state-owned enterprises and move to an effectively floating exchange rate. Osborne\u2019s trip will see him travel to four Chinese cities, starting with Beijing and then Shanghai, Chengdu and Urumqi in the far north west. On Monday he is due to meet senior Chinese leaders in Beijing while on Tuesday he will visit the Shanghai stock exchange, the epicentre of the summer\u2019s market chaos. \u201cI am going very deliberately to the Shanghai stock exchange and I\u2019m going to talk there specifically about the financial markets and the events of the summer,\u201d Osborne told an audience of high-tech entrepreneurs in Beijing. \u201cOf course there have been ups and downs. But in our estimation, the spillover effects - the impact of that on other financial markets - has been relatively limited.\u201d Osborne\u2019s trip to China is part of growing efforts to boost ties between London and Beijing following a diplomatic spat that began in 2012 when - to the Communist party\u2019s fury - David Cameron met with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. China imposed a top-level freeze in ministerial contact but relations were subsequently restored and Cameron vowed to build a \u201clasting friendship\u201d with Beijing during a December 2013 visit. Now, officials in both China and Britain are vowing to push for a \u201cgolden decade\u201d of relations. \u201cWe want Britain to be China\u2019s best partner in the west and that is what brings us here today,\u201d Osborne said on Sunday. A series of major Chinese investments in Britain are expected to be unveiled next month when president Xi Jinping travels there next month on his first state visit to the country. Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill, who is travelling with Osborne in China, said the country\u2019s continued slowdown was \u201cvery predictable\u201d and that he remained upbeat about the prospects of what he called the \u201cNew China\u201d. \u201cOf the four \u2018Bric\u2019 countries, so far this decade China is the only that has grown by more than I assumed it would do at the start of the decade,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who created the bric acronym in 2001. China\u2019s official GDP growth target for 2015 is 7%, the lowest in 25 years.",

      "bodyText": "Two companies heading towards flotations in London worth billions of pounds face pressure over a lack of female representation on their boards following criticism from the peer behind a drive to improve the gender balance in boardrooms. Lord Davies, who oversaw the coalition government\u2019s initiative to increase the participation of women on boards, said investors should \u201ctake into account\u201d the all-male boards of insurer Hastings and payment processing company Worldpay before deciding whether to back the floats. Neither Hastings, which is preparing for a \u00a31.5bn flotation, nor Worldpay, which could be valued at \u00a33.5bn when it floats, have any female representation at the highest level. This is despite corporate governance guidelines suggesting they select directors from the widest possible pool of talent. Davies described the situation as disappointing and said he was sure investors would take it into account when thinking of whether to invest or not. The peer said he was surprised that shareholders in Hastings and Worldpay had not raised the women issue as one of major concern. Hastings is controlled by Goldman Sachs and the insurance entrepreneur Neil Utley and other founders, while private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent control Worldpay. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing in the current climate,\u201d said Davies. Women now hold 23.5% of directorships in the FTSE 100 stock market index, close to the Davies target of 25%. \u201cWe have made so much progress and have gone from a point where 21 FTSE 100 companies had no women on their board to none, showing that self-regulation can work,\u201d he added. Referring to the lack of a female presence on the Hastings and Worldpay boards, Katushka Giltsoff of the Miles Partnership, an executive search group, said: \u201cWhen you see things like this it makes you put your hands up in the air and say how nothing has changed.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are plenty of women who could have stepped onto an insurance company\u2019s board. There needs to be a dialogue going so that investment bankers challenge the status quo. \u201c Female boardroom representation in FTSE 100 companies may is increasing but it is far lower in companies that are joining the stock market. According to data collected by Financial News, only 11.5% of the directors of companies floated in London in 2013 were women. The figure nudged up, but only slightly, to 13.6% in 2014. Gay Collins, a founder member of the steering committee the 30% Club, which aims to increase representation of women on UK boards to at least 30%, said: \u201cYou\u2019d have thought that a flotation would be the perfect time to get the board structure fit for purpose for the future, but the reality is that it\u2019s often done in a rush, without using headhunters and through contacts of the advisers or the company.\u201d Hastings\u2019s chief executive Gary Hoffman, the former chief executive of Northern Rock, said he tried hard to have as diverse a board as possible. \u201cWe interviewed quite a few women, ones who were plc or industry ready, but the ones we wanted were either too busy or conflicted. We could easily have ticked all the boxes to avoid press and corporate governance criticism but we\u2019re still interviewing and we might get somebody quite soon.\u201d Hoffman, who has worked for Barclays and Northern Rock, said he has always been a diversity champion, whether of gender or ethnicity. He has pledged that within 12 months the company will be compliant with the corporate governance code, having a higher proportion of independent directors as well as at least one woman on board. One advisor on the Hastings float, which is set to go ahead in the next few weeks, said he had raised the issue of female representation. \u201cI knew this would be an issue,\u201d he said. The group points out that two female board members, Clare Ryder and Selina Sagayam, already sit on the company\u2019s subsidiary board. Some well-known business-women, including Kathleen O\u2019Donovan, a director of a number of companies, and Anne Godbehere, a director at Prudential, were sounded out for board positions with Hastings but turned them down. Goldman sources said that the Wall Street bank\u2019s private equity arm, which holds the Hastings investment, was committed to having women on the company\u2019s board and that the process to do this had started. Some say that the lack of priority given to boardroom gender diversity in companies heading for the stock market is letting down the considerable progress among companies that are already listed. The expectation at Worldpay, which decided on Friday to press ahead with aflotation, is that it will hire further non-executive directors and will aim to add female representation to its board within weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re in advanced discussions with a female candidate and hope to have her on board by the time the prospectus is filed,\u201d one source said. Giltsoff said that women still fared badly in UK boardrooms outside the FTSE 100. \u201cIf you drop below the FTSE 100 a lot of companies are resistant to change and in some FTSE 250 companies there is blatant sexism.\u201d She said the 30% club had struggled to get support from the chairs of a number of FTSE 250 companies.",

      "bodyText": "Network Rail could be privatised as the government seeks a solution to its financial problems, according to the industry executive leading a review of the state-owned operator of Britain\u2019s rail tracks and stations. Nicola Shaw, who is due to report back to the government early next year on the future structure and financing of Network Rail, said she could not rule out recommending privatisation. \u201cI have been asked to consider the structure and financing of Network Rail. On the former point I am considering Network Rail\u2019s relationships with its customers, how its structure works with government devolution and how the industry works where there is growing demand for the railway,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the latter, I am looking at all the issues and options on the spectrum from where we are now to full privatisation.\u201d Her comments come as new Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn prepares to announce full renationalisation of the railways - by taking privately operated franchises back into public ownership as they expire - as his first major policy at the Labour conference in Brighton next week. Shaw, the chief executive of the HS1 rail line, which runs from London St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel, said earlier on Sunday in an interview with the BBC that political considerations would not influence her review of Network Rail. \u201cI haven\u2019t been asked to think about it politically. I have been asked to think about it starting from what is going to work,\u201d she said. The suggestion that Network Rail could be privatised prompted an angry reaction from the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) trade union. \u201cAny threat to bust up and sell off Network Rail will meet with the hardest possible industrial and political response from RMT. This union will never sit on the sidelines while public and staff safety is threatened in the name of private greed and corporate profit,\u201d said RMT general secretary Mick Cash. Shaw\u2019s review is one of three into Network Rail promised by the government against the backdrop of mounting costs, debts and delays at the operator of stations, tracks and signalling. Network Rail\u2019s new chairman Sir Peter Hendy, former transport commissioner for London, is reviewing whatcan be delivered from an original \u00a338.5bn five-year plan that the government had trumpeted as \u201cthe biggest investment in rail since Victorian times\u201d. Economist Colette Bowe is due to report soon on what lessons can be learned from the crisis at Network Rail and how to improve investment planning. The announcement of Shaw\u2019s review into funding had already prompted warnings from trade unions that Network Rail could be taken out of public hands. Shaw told the BBC she was looking for a \u201cway forward that people will support.\u201d \u201cI am talking to unions, and to representatives of staff and to other members of different parties so I hope we have strong engagement because I think it matters,\u201d she said. Escalating costs at Network Rail have emerged as the government tries to cut public spending further in a bid to bring down the budget deficit. Concerns about the operator\u2019s ballooning debt intensified after Network Rail was reclassified a year ago as a public body. That brought greater oversight from the government but meant Network Rail was no longer able to borrow freely to meet rising costs. Problems at the operator have also dealt a blow to chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plans for a rebalanced economy that includes a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, a cornerstone of which is better transport links between cities in northern England. But the government was forced to announce in June that it had shelved promised and vital upgrades to major rail lines in the Midlands and the north of England due to cost overruns and delays at Network Rail. Earlier this year, a damning report from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, found that Network Rail had missed more than a third of its targets in the first year of its control period - or five-year plan for 2014 to 2019 - raising \u201cserious questions about its ability to deliver future projects\u201d. Train operators on long-haul routes have grown impatient with delays caused by track faults. Discontent among rail passengers has also risen. A national survey by Transport Focus showed customer satisfaction levels fell to 80% in 2015, meaning one in five journeys was deemed unsatisfactory. Responding to Shaw\u2019s comments on possible privatisation, a Department for Transport spokesman said it awaited her recommendations on how the government should \u201capproach the longer-term future shape and financing of Network Rail\u201d. \u201cWe will consider her final report when it is produced in time for the budget next year,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The contrast could hardly be sharper. Razor wire fences are being constructed to keep the uprooted poor out of the European Union at the very moment the United Nations meets to agree anti-poverty goals for the next 15 years. No question, the gathering in New York will be a regular jamboree. There will be mutual backslapping about the progress that has been made over the past 15 years, a good deal of it justified. Countries will solemnly pledge to meet the 17 sustainable development goals, with 169 specific targets, by 2030. They will turn a blind eye to what is happening in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia and Austria. The truth, though, is that there is a link between the UN shindig and the most severe refugee crisis in generations: inequality. It is the obvious disparity between life in a rich country and life in a poor country that makes the long and dangerous journey to the west attractive. It is the gap between rich and poor within developed countries that has helped foster a deep suspicion, not just of unlimited migration, but of free movement of capital and goods as well. And without addressing inequality head on, ensuring that growth benefits the poor by as much as it benefits the rich, there is not the remotest chance that the ambitious goals being embraced in New York this week will be met. Here\u2019s the picture. The SDGs replace the millennium development goals that set the framework for poverty reduction between 2000 and 2015, but are much tougher. The MDGs sought to make progress in areas such as poverty reduction or infant mortality: the SDGs will commit the international community to more ambitious goals, which include ending poverty and hunger, and ensuring healthy lives and access to quality education for all. There are reasons to be optimistic. Much progress has been made in the past two decades, in large part due to the rapid growth in China. One billion people have been lifted out of poverty and the MDG objective of halving the number living below the global agreed minimum was achieved five years early. This will be seen by world leaders as evidence that even more can be done in the next 15 years. But achieving the new SDGs would be a gargantuan task in the best of times. And these are not the best of times. China is growing more slowly, with concerns that doctored official figures mask a hard landing. Emerging markets in the rest of the world are being hurt both by weaker Chinese demand for their commodities and by the continued sluggishness of the big western economies. The Great Recession of 2008-09 continues to cast a long shadow. The changing mood has resulted in a less generous approach to aid, where the donor community has been cutting assistance in real terms in response to domestic financial pressures. It is also clear that the tide of globalisation has ebbed since its high point in the 1990s. Two decades ago, the public in the west could see the benefits of breaking down barriers: it meant cheaper manufactured goods from China and other developing countries, which pushed down the cost of living and raised disposable incomes. But globalisation also meant free movement of capital, which allowed the banks to take the risks that led to the meltdown of 2007, and has encouraged people from poorer countries to seek a better life in the west. These aspects of globalisation have proved much less popular. The physical barriers to free movement of people being constructed on the southern borders of the EU are merely the physical manifestation of a wider set of measures aimed at controlling the free movement of capital, labour and goods. These include ring-fencing the retail and investment operations of banks, the decision by a number of eurozone governments to adopt a financial transactions tax, and the introduction of capital controls by countries faced by bank runs. There has not been a multilateral trade agreement since 1993 and the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Kenya in December looks like being a sombre affair. After 14 years of wrangling, the chances are that the meeting will administer the last rites to the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks. The continued impasse at the WTO has prompted countries to try an alternative route: bilateral deals or agreements involving a number of willing participants. These have not been without their problems either: there has been widespread public opposition in Europe to the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), mainly due to fears that it would allow multinational companies to use a body for settling disputes to undermine the power of governments to act in what they consider to be the best interests of their citizens. Rising inequality explains the growing hostility to calls from business lobbies to do a TTIP deal or from free-market think tanks for countries to open their borders to people from developing countries seeking work. The benefits of globalisation have been unfairly skewed towards a privileged elite, a trend that leads to lower global growth according to the International Monetary Fund. Work by the UK Overseas Development Institute has shown that the progress made towards poverty reduction in developing countries would have been even more rapid had the poor not, in many cases, been left behind. The think tank has calculated that an additional 700 million people would have escaped poverty between 1990 and 2010 had the incomes of the poorest 40% grown by two percentage points faster than the average. The evidence is that those countries, such as Guinea, where incomes of the poor did rise by more than the average, saw bigger reductions in poverty. Inequality also threatens the SDG for healthcare, where the lack of access to universal antenatal care means progress has been slow in reducing the number of children dying in the first days and weeks of their lives. The rich in developing countries are well looked after; the poor are not. The message is clear. Governments in both developed and developing countries have to embrace the idea of pro-poor growth. Oxfam says action is needed in three key areas: fair tax rules that ensure that all players \u2013 including the rich and multinational companies \u2013 pay their fair share; the investment of the missing tax billions in better public services; and secure, well-paid jobs for men and women that allow them to work their way out of poverty. A good start would be for this week\u2019s UN conference to set intermediate targets for reducing inequality for 2020 and 2025. Why? Because without such a commitment, the backlash against globalisation will intensify, the flows of desperate people leaving developing countries will continue to increase, the razor wire will continue to be rolled out, and the world will be a poorer place.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has ordered an external investigation after US regulators found that the carmaker designed software for close to half a million diesel cars that gave false emissions data, its CEO said, adding he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the violation of US rules. \u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,\u201d Martin Winterkorn said in a statement published on Sunday by the carmaker on Sunday. \u201cVolkswagen has ordered an external investigation of this matter.\u201d The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday the software deceived regulators measuring toxic emissions, adding that Volkswagen could face fines of up to $18bn (\u00a311.5bn) as a result. The carmaker could face penalties of $37,500 for each car not in compliance with clean air rules. The diesel-powered models from 2009-2015 are the VW Jetta, Beetle and Golf, the Passat model from 2014-15, and the Audi A3 from 2009 to 2015. \u201cWe do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law,\u201d said Winterkorn, adding the company was fully co-operating with the relevant agencies. He gave no details on who would carry out the external investigation. Cynthia Giles, an enforcement officer at the EPA, said on Friday that the cars in question \u201ccontained software that turns off emissions controls when driving normally and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test\u201d. \u201cVW was concealing the facts from the EPA, the state of California and from consumers. We expected better from VW,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health.\u201d The EPA accused Volkswagen of using the device in 482,000 four-cyclinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars in the US since 2008. VW must recall all the cars, remove the defeat device and improve the cars\u2019 NOx emissions, which creates smog and has been linked to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses. The feature, which the EPA called a defeat device, masks the true emissions only during testing and therefore when the cars are on the road they emit as much as 40 times the level of pollutants allowed under clean air rules meant to ensure public health is protected, said Giles. Volkswagen suspended sales of cars containing the company\u2019s four-cylinder turbo direct injection (TDI) engine on Friday in light of the investigation. The \u201cclean diesel\u201d engine is commonly used in models including VW\u2019s Beetle, Golf, Jetta, Passat and the A3 luxury compact made by VW-owned Audi. Richard Corey, executive officer of the California Air Resources Board (Carb), said on Friday: \u201cOur goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen\u2019s efforts to cheat on clean air rules, and to take appropriate further action.\u201d The EPA and Carb discovered the defeat device software following independent analysis by researchers at West Virginia University, who were promoted into action by the International Council on Clean Technology, an NGO. When confronted with the EPA and Carb\u2019s evidence, VW admitted that its cars were fitted with the defeat device. The crackdown on Volkswagen comes as the Obama administration is attempting to cut air pollution from an array of sources, including the vehicle industry, power plants and oil and natural-gas providers. The EPA set new carbon rules for big trucks earlier this year and has told all vehicle makers they must sell light vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. In Europe, new laws have forced manufacturers to test their cars under real world conditions and not in laboratories, helping to reduce unrealistic claims about emissions. By 2017 all new cars will have to be more stringently tested, effectively ending an era when car makers could exaggerate the performance of their machines. UK car industry group the SMMT claims that, because of European legislation to cut tailpipe pollution, Britain\u2019s air quality is better now than it has been for centuries.",

    "webTitle": "The innovators: levitating lightbulbs take design back to the future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Like many young boys growing up at a time when Michael J Fox skated about Hill Valley in the Back to the Future series, Simon Morris dreamed of one day having a hoverboard like the device that appeared in the sequels. Working in display design years later, the idea stuck with the New Yorker as he worked with magnets in order to make shoes and skateboards levitate above a surface for exhibitions and shows. By using the repelling poles of magnets \u2013 one embedded in the shoe and the other on a stand \u2013 the item would seemingly float in mid air. Then came his lightbulb moment. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could power the bulb wirelessly and levitate it?\u201d he asked. The result is Flyte, a low-power lightbulb that levitates and rotates in the air using a series of magnets and which is powered without touching the surface \u2013 through a system usually seen on high-end kitchen counters. The eye-catching lamp is the first step in what 38-year-old Morris and his team say could be a new method of powering items such as music speakers, which would levitate and turn in the air. Morris, who describes himself as an art scientist, developed his interest in gravity and suspension when he moved from his native United States to Stockholm and worked with brands such as Nike to create displays in which items would be made to appear to float in the air. The next step was an attempt to power something \u2013 in this case a lightbulb \u2013 while it levitated. The solution came by using induction, wherein an electromagnet with a current flowing through it can generate a current in another body placed nearby. Induction hobs in kitchens create an electromagnetic field which, when in contact with magnetic material like an iron pan, transfers or \u201cinduces\u201d energy into the metal and heats food. \u201cWorking on the technology, you can\u2019t help thinking how you could make it go further. One of the ideas I was thinking about was how you could combine levitation with other technologies and at the time induction was really interesting. It was really promising because the idea of coupling two coils together to send electricity through the air would be perfect with levitation,\u201d Morris said. The Flyte bulb works by a combination of induction and magnetism. The unit is formed of a base, which is connected to a standard power supply, and the specially made lightbulb. While gravity pulls the lightbulb towards the base, it is pushed up by the opposing force of the magnetism. At the same time, the bulb is being powered by induction. The electromagnetic field heats the coil in the bulb, as it would heat a pan on a cooker. \u201cThe lightbulb contains a cap. Inside the cap is a magnet. Inside the magnet is a coil and that coil receives the electricity and powers the light. It is powering the light through the coil using magnetic levitation,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt is simple but in this kind of combination it has not been applied that often \u2013 levitation and induction. We are combining these two types of technologies.\u201d In practice, this works by placing the bulb at the centre of the wooden base. When the light comes on, the unit is in operation and can be turned on and off by tapping the surface of the base. The light is unlikely to provide illumination for bedtime reading however. While a standard 40W bulb gives a brightness of about 450 lumens \u2013 the unit of measurement for light emitted by a source \u2013 the Flyte has a maximum brightness of 60 lumens. The device is less a functional light and more a cross between a decorative lamp and a piece of art, say the creators, and also the first step in what they could create with the combination of the technologies. Priced at $299 (\u00a3190) for one unit, the company has pre-orders for 2,300 lamps, which will begin to be shipped next month after a successful Kickstarter fundraising campaign that brought in over $600,000 (\u00a3385,00), more than five times its original target. \u201cThe wow factor is that this lamp is levitating and it is not only levitating but it is being powered through mid air. It could definitely be considered expensive for some people but what we are trying to get is [to show] that this is what you can do. This is our first product but we can take it much further,\u201d Morris said. As well as lighting up the bulb, the pad on which it levitates above can be used as a wireless recharger for mobile phones. This type of inductive charging is becoming increasingly common in the consumer electronics market. Wireless charging pads are now available in some McDonalds restaurants and Starbucks cafes in the UK. The levitating technology could be used as a speaker system that would rotate in the air just as the bulb does in the Flyte product, said co-founder Daniel Mascarenhas. \u201cImagine a few points in your living room where the speakers are floating,\u201d he said. Other opportunities for floating and revolving objects present themselves in museums, said Morris. \u201cWhen an object is levitating, it rotates on its axis so imagine you can control rotation and imagine you can control the height at which the object rotates. Imagine that you are seeing an object or a sculpture, instead of walking around a sculpture to see all the angles, it rotates in the air. You can view it from every possible angle from one place,\u201d he said. Restaurants could use the Flytes instead of candles in the middle of table settings, said Mascarenhas. But diners should not be alarmed by the consequences of a blackout. In the case of a power outage, the bulb will land back on the base: a shatterproof unit would absorb the impact, say the creators.

      "body": "<p>Like many young boys growing up at a time when Michael J Fox skated about Hill Valley in the Back to the Future series, Simon Morris dreamed of one day having a hoverboard like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkyLnWm1iCs\">device that appeared in the sequels</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/09/the-innovators-cheaper-batteries-could-help-electric-cars-hit-the-mainstream\">The innovators: cheaper batteries could help electric cars hit the mainstream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Working in display design years later, the idea stuck with the New Yorker as he worked with magnets in order to make shoes and skateboards levitate above a surface for exhibitions and shows. By using the repelling poles of magnets \u2013 one embedded in the shoe and the other on a stand \u2013 the item would seemingly float in mid air. Then came his lightbulb moment.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could power the bulb wirelessly and levitate it?\u201d he asked. The result is Flyte, a low-power lightbulb that levitates and rotates in the air using a series of magnets and which is powered without touching the surface \u2013 through a system usually seen on high-end kitchen counters.</p> <p>The eye-catching lamp is the first step in what 38-year-old Morris and his team say could be a new method of powering items such as music speakers, which would levitate and turn in the air.</p> <p>Morris, who describes himself as an art scientist, developed his interest in gravity and suspension when he moved from his native United States to Stockholm and worked with brands such as Nike to create displays in which items would be made to appear to float in the air. The next step was an attempt to power something \u2013 in this case a lightbulb \u2013 while it levitated. </p> <p>The solution came by using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction\">induction</a>, wherein an electromagnet with a current flowing through it can generate a current in another body placed nearby. Induction hobs in kitchens create an electromagnetic field which, when in contact with magnetic material like an iron pan, transfers or \u201cinduces\u201d energy into the metal and heats food. </p> <p></p> <p>\u201cWorking on the technology, you can\u2019t help thinking how you could make it go further. One of the ideas I was thinking about was how you could combine levitation with other technologies and at the time induction was really interesting. It was really promising because the idea of coupling two coils together to send electricity through the air would be perfect with levitation,\u201d Morris said.</p> <p>The Flyte bulb works by a combination of induction and magnetism. The unit is formed of a base, which is connected to a standard power supply, and the specially made lightbulb. While gravity pulls the lightbulb towards the base, it is pushed up by the opposing force of the magnetism. At the same time, the bulb is being powered by induction. The electromagnetic field heats the coil in the bulb, as it would heat a pan on a cooker.</p> <p>\u201cThe lightbulb contains a cap. Inside the cap is a magnet.

      "bodyText": "Can a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers at which nothing much happens \u2013 at which interest rates remain unchanged \u2013 still be significant for investors? You betcha, and here\u2019s why. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary Fed meeting, something to which Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Wealth Management, can testify. \u201cWe did a call for our clients and had 300 people on the line, and I can\u2019t remember even doing a call of this kind for a regularly scheduled Fed meeting before. This time, we felt compelled to do so,\u201d because the meeting was seen as such a turning point in the Fed\u2019s policymaking. And so it proved, even though the Fed\u2019s chairman, Janet Yellen, announced up front that that the Fed wasn\u2019t going to raise interest rates. To be frank, that didn\u2019t come as much of a shock. This \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d debate has swung back and forth for months. With China showing clear signs of a slowing economy, the \u201cwon\u2019ts\u201d are once more ascendant. More than half of economists surveyed in most polls in the days leading up to the two-day meeting calculated that the members of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee would continue to play it safe in light of the uncertainty added to the picture by the turmoil in China. As is often the case with the Fed\u2019s pronouncements, what mattered wasn\u2019t in the headline but in the details \u2013 and how investors react to the news. The announcement was triply dovish, pundits have noted. Not only did the Fed fail to boost rates, but it accompanied its decision with \u201cdovish\u201d language, such as the belief that volatility in the emerging markets and the economic uncertainty in regions like China may well \u201cput further downward pressure on inflation in the near term\u201d. Then, too, the Fed cut its forecasts for US economic growth in 2016 and 2017. In response, the stock market bounced around late Thursday afternoon and Friday, as investors and traders tried to make sense of all the news and data points \u2013 and the absence of the key factor, a rate hike \u2013 only to turn south Friday morning and post much larger losses. Unsurprisingly, the Fed\u2019s announcement was the cue for Treasury bonds to stage a big relief rally. But regardless of what the financial markets are doing in the short term, investors shouldn\u2019t be either panicking or celebrating. They do, however, need to ponder their strategy, and find a way to cope with the uncertainty that the Fed\u2019s inaction and decision to postpone making the critical decision has left behind. The biggest disappointment, for many investors and Fed watchers, was the lack of guidance and transparency in the announcement. The result? \u201cA lot of uncertainty; more so than in recent memory,\u201d groused Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, on a conference call with clients on Thursday afternoon. He admitted that he was \u201csomewhat disappointed\u201d by the lack of forward guidance with respect to the Fed\u2019s strategy, in light of the context in which the central back is operating. That makes it tougher for professional investors. \u201cMarkets are clamoring for certainty,\u201d agreed Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock. \u201cCertainty,\u201d he argued, \u201crelieves markets more than does keeping rates low for an extended period of time.\u201d Ironically, individual investors \u2013 unlike the folks at BlackRock and Wells Fargo, who must shoulder the burden of managing other people\u2019s money \u2013 may have an easier job of navigating the weeks that lie between now and the next crucial date in the Fed\u2019s calendar: the meeting scheduled for 15 and 16 December. That is, as long as they stay calm and focus on their long-term goals and ignore the short-term volatility, which most pundits say is likely to increase. What to do? Firstly, shun cash. \u201cCash returns will stay below inflation,\u201d Rehling argues, and with interest rate hikes on hold for the next few months (and some of that already priced in anyway), it\u2019s better to find a safe corner of the bond market in which to park your cash than it is to try and time the Fed and wait for higher rates. So, what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not, in bonds? Well, high yield securities, aka junk bonds, remain a tricky area, in the eyes of many. The market \u201chas changed \u2013 it is 41% larger than it was five years ago, and individuals own a lot more of it,\u201d says Rehling. That alone is going to make it more volatile and potentially more perilous; activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been actively shorting junk bonds, is only one of a number of investors to believe that investors\u2019 hunger for yield during the years that the Fed has kept interest rates at record low levels has created a de facto bubble in that market. On the other hand, investment-grade bonds \u2013 those issued by companies with solid credit ratings \u2013 and municipal bonds with slightly less than pristine credit scores look appealing, offering attractive enough yields without having been on the receiving end of the same kind of torrent of cash in recent years. BNY Mellon\u2019s Grohowski says his team spent Thursday afternoon snapping up appealing bonds in this category, including municipal bonds with single-A ratings. \u201cYou have to have the mindset that you\u2019ll own them to the time they mature,\u201d he says. The upside? Owning a bond to maturity makes it easier to ride out or even ignore the inevitable volatility storms and pocket the stream of income it generates, while recouping the capital at the end of the bond\u2019s lifetime. The same kind of guidelines apply to the stock market. The Fed\u2019s policy of keeping yields near zero has caused investors to bid up the prices of some kinds of stocks, to levels that may exceed their valuations. \u201cPeople have bought income funds and other products that promised enhanced yields and those owned a lot of utility stocks, preferred stocks, and stocks with high dividend yields,\u201d says Grohowski, noting that investors may fare better looking at companies with more modest dividend payment rates \u2013 say, 3% or 4% \u2013 that are doing a good job at generating cash and thus might be able to increase that payout. (And if they don\u2019t do so voluntarily, he points out, activist investors like Carl Icahn will step in to exert some pressure.) It might also \u2013 finally \u2013 be time for some alternative investment vehicles to come into their own, such as absolute return funds, long/short hedged funds or managed futures funds. In an environment where the stock market has been roaring higher, these offerings have performed poorly on both an absolute and relative basis, but may do better when compared to a flat and/or volatile market environment. Just don\u2019t expect miracles. The Fed\u2019s decision to stay on hold \u2013 and the resultant lingering uncertainty \u2013 added to the ongoing global turmoil represent headwinds for investors, and so, too, does the fact that corporate earnings have been \u201cas flat as a pancake\u201d so far this year. Even if earnings show some improvement when the second quarter wraps up in a few weeks, that may not be enough to spark a stock market rally. Now, settle back, and start preparing for another round of Fed mania, just in time for Christmas.",

The Fed\u2019s policy of keeping yields near zero has caused investors to bid up the prices of some kinds of stocks, to levels that may exceed their valuations. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have bought income funds and other products that promised enhanced yields and those owned a lot of utility stocks, preferred stocks, and stocks with high <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp\">dividend yields</a>,\u201d says Grohowski, noting that investors may fare better looking at companies with more modest dividend payment rates \u2013 say, 3% or 4% \u2013 that are doing a good job at generating cash and thus might be able to increase that payout. (And if they don\u2019t do so voluntarily, he points out, activist investors like Carl Icahn will step in to exert some pressure.)</p> <p>It might also \u2013 finally \u2013 be time for some alternative investment vehicles to come into their own, such as absolute return funds, long/short hedged funds or managed futures funds. In an environment where the stock market has been roaring higher, these offerings <a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3488799/asset-management-fixed-income/challenged-absolute-return-bond-funds-keep-chasing-alpha.html\">have performed poorly</a> on both an absolute and relative basis, but may do better when compared to a flat and/or volatile market environment.</p> <p>Just don\u2019t expect miracles. The Fed\u2019s decision to stay on hold \u2013 and the resultant lingering uncertainty \u2013 added to the ongoing global turmoil represent headwinds for investors, and so, too, does the fact that corporate earnings have been \u201cas flat as a pancake\u201d so far this year. Even if earnings show some improvement when the second quarter wraps up in a few weeks, that may not be enough to spark a stock market rally. </p> <p>Now, settle back, and start preparing for another round of Fed mania, just in time for Christmas.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Greece goes to the polls on Sunday, with Alexis Tsipras once again fighting for his political life, all eyes will be on the recession-scarred nation and the fragile truce it has struck with its eurozone creditors. Whatever the outcome, fresh spending cuts and further economic misery look unavoidable. But Greece\u2019s tragedy, which is far from over, is playing out against the background of a simmering crisis in the global economy. Indeed, if the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is worth listening to \u2013 which he almost invariably is \u2013 Greece\u2019s travails are merely one part of the long-running financial and economic crisis that has rippled around the world since the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed seven years ago. On this analysis, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to delay its long-planned interest rate rise last Thursday is another part of the same unsettling picture. While Greece\u2019s political and economic pain has been particularly acute, it is ultimately still trying to work off the legacy of the cheap credit that poured into the country after it joined the European single currency, at a time when financiers roamed unchecked and central bankers were congratulating themselves for taming inflation. Yellen blamed \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, in particular the turmoil in China, for the Fed\u2019s decision to delay interest-rate \u201cliftoff\u201d, as Wall Street calls it. And while Mark Carney has made clear that he\u2019s itching to start raising rates in the UK \u2013 he has repeatedly pointed to \u201cthe turn of the year\u201d as the time when the decision on monetary policy will \u201ccome into sharper focus\u201d \u2013 he too is likely to have to stay his hand if the crisis worsens. Indeed, Haldane believes the Bank may have to do more than that. As emerging economies slow down, sucking demand out of the global economy and depressing commodity prices, what Albert Edwards of investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has called a \u201ctidal wave of deflation\u201d could yet be unleashed. With interest rates already at a record low of 0.5%, the Bank has little ammunition left. So Haldane believes it may eventually have to think much more radically \u2013 perhaps even levying a negative interest rate. He says that this might be made possible if central banks could harness similar technology to that used in the virtual currency Bitcoin. Instead of grubby notes and coins, consumers would pay and be paid using electronic deposits on their phones or computers \u2013 and their banks could then penalise them for failing to spend that money. The idea would be to counteract the natural instinct of companies and consumers, many of whom remain heavily burdened with debt, to sit on their cash during rocky times. As so often with Haldane, it\u2019s wacky, wonk-ish stuff. But it underlines the scale of the challenge he believes central banks may face, in a world in which it looks increasingly likely that they have tackled one crisis by creating a rolling series of other disasters elsewhere in the world. Former City regulator Adair Turner also mused recently about the long-term legacy of ever-increasing debt burdens on the health of the economy. Ben Bernanke\u2019s much-quoted \u201chelicopter money\u201d speech in 2002, in which he spelled out how quantitative easing might work, seemed purely academic when it was delivered. But desperate policymakers \u2013 not least Gordon Brown \u2013 were quick to pull it off the shelf as the crisis raged. Meanwhile, it may be scant comfort to the Greek people, forced to endure a collapse in GDP and a rise in unemployment on the scale suffered by the US at the time of the Great Depression, that their grief is perhaps just one strand in a \u201cthree-part crisis trilogy\u201d of the 2008 crash, the eurozone meldown of 2011 and now the emerging markets. But as China\u2019s slowdown intensifies, and the victims of the downturn multiply \u2013 from Canada to Turkey, Malaysia to Brazil \u2013 Greece is rapidly losing its status as the most troubling hotspot in an increasingly troubled global economy. Shell\u2019s high-risk game in the Arctic Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, was on a media blitz last week trying to prop up sagging confidence in his ability to keep paying blue-chip dividends while expanding his empire at a time of very low oil prices. The planned takeover of BG Group is an important test of the Dutchman\u2019s credibility in the City and on Wall Street, but an increasing number of analysts are questioning whether it makes sense with $50-a-barrel oil. While number-crunchers argue about the wisdom of that move, others are exercised about Shell\u2019s apparent determination to drill in the Arctic. Van Beurden insists the opportunities are immense and that exploration will go on, but he has clearly been shaken by the hostility it has provoked. It is not just environmentalists who think Shell should abandon its work in the far north. An increasing number of respected energy leaders such as former BP top brass Lord Browne and Nick Butler question its wisdom. Fatih Birol, incoming executive director of the highly influential International Energy Agency, has become the latest to throw cold water on it: \u201cIt is geologically difficult, technologically difficult, lots of environmental challenges, the costs are very, very high,\u201d he said last week. And a former head of French oil company Total said he believed the reputational damage of an oil spill in the pristine waters of the Arctic would be too immense for a company to bear. But Lord Browne believes the real issue is that of cost. It is enormously expensive to work in the far north, which is why Shell has already burned up $7bn with nothing to show for it. Our guess is that Shell will complete its takeover of BG next spring and will use the occasion to reassess its global priorities. This would provide an excuse to scrap the drilling operation in the Chukchi Sea. What began as a wrongheaded decision has turned into a huge embarrassment \u2013 it is starting to look like a worse version of the PR disaster that was the sinking of the Brent Spar platform. Some people never learn Remember Vodafone\u2019s takeover of Mannesmann 15 years ago? It smashed into the record books as the biggest cross-border hostile bid in history at a whopping \u00a3100bn and came amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions around the world. Time Warner and AOL were married \u2013 only to divorce 10 years later. Vodafone also came to regret the price it paid for its German rival, taking a goodwill writedown of \u00a328bn. The trip down memory lane may be one worth taking for the current kingmakers. If Anheuser-Busch InBev succeeds in its attempts to buy rival brewer SABMiller it would earn a place in the top 10 of M&amp;A deals. A deal announced a few days later, under which Altice is buying Cablevision for $17.7bn (\u00a311.4bn), pushed the value of $10bn-plus \u201cmega-deals\u201d so far in 2015 through levels last seen in 1999. One analyst told the FT that the $34.90 a share Altice was paying for Cablevision compared badly with the $8 he thought it was worth. History repeating itself?",

      "body": "<p>As Greece goes to the polls on Sunday, with Alexis Tsipras once again fighting for his political life, all eyes will be on the recession-scarred nation and the fragile truce it has struck with its eurozone creditors. Whatever the outcome, fresh spending cuts and further economic misery look unavoidable. But Greece\u2019s tragedy, which is far from over, is playing out against the background of a simmering crisis in the global economy.</p> <p>Indeed, if the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is worth listening to \u2013 which he almost invariably is \u2013 Greece\u2019s travails <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/beware-the-global-financial-crisis-part-iii\" title=\"\">are merely one part of the long-running financial and economic crisis</a> that has rippled around the world since the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed seven years ago. On this analysis, the Federal Reserve\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-record-low\" title=\"\">decision to delay its long-planned interest rate rise</a> last Thursday is another part of the same unsettling picture.</p> <p>While Greece\u2019s political and economic pain has been particularly acute, it is ultimately still trying to work off the legacy of the cheap credit that poured into the country after it joined the European single currency, at a time when financiers roamed unchecked and central bankers were congratulating themselves for taming&#xa0;inflation.</p> <p>Yellen blamed \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, in particular the turmoil in China, for the Fed\u2019s decision to delay interest-rate \u201cliftoff\u201d, as Wall Street calls it. And while Mark Carney has made clear that he\u2019s itching to start raising rates in the UK \u2013 he has repeatedly pointed to \u201cthe turn of the year\u201d as the time when the decision on monetary policy will \u201ccome into sharper focus\u201d \u2013 he too is likely to have to stay his hand if the crisis worsens.</p> <p>Indeed, Haldane believes the Bank may have to do more than that. As emerging economies slow down, sucking demand out of the global economy and depressing commodity prices, what Albert Edwards of investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has called a \u201ctidal wave of deflation\u201d could yet be unleashed.</p> <p>With interest rates already at a record low of 0.5%, the Bank has little ammunition left. So Haldane believes it may eventually have to think much more radically \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/interest-rates-rise-bank-of-england-chief-economist-andy-haldane\" title=\"\">perhaps even levying a negative interest rate</a>. He says that this might be made possible if central banks could harness similar technology to that used in the virtual currency Bitcoin. Instead of grubby notes and coins, consumers would pay and be paid using electronic deposits on their phones or computers \u2013 and their banks could then penalise them for failing to spend that money.</p> <p>The idea would be to counteract the natural instinct of companies and consumers, many of whom remain heavily burdened with debt, to sit on their cash during rocky times.</p> <p>As so often with Haldane, it\u2019s wacky, wonk-ish stuff. But it underlines the scale of the challenge he believes central banks may face, in a world in which it looks increasingly likely that they have tackled one crisis by creating a rolling series of other disasters elsewhere in the world. Former City regulator Adair Turner also mused recently about the long-term legacy of ever-increasing debt burdens on the health of the economy.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke\u2019s much-quoted \u201chelicopter money\u201d speech in 2002, in which he spelled out how quantitative easing might work, seemed purely academic when it was delivered. But desperate policymakers \u2013 not least Gordon Brown \u2013 were quick to pull it off the shelf as the crisis raged.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it may be scant comfort to the Greek people, forced to endure a collapse in GDP and a rise in unemployment on the scale suffered by the US at the time of the Great Depression, that their grief is perhaps just one strand in a \u201cthree-part crisis trilogy\u201d of the 2008 crash, the eurozone meldown of 2011 and now the emerging markets.</p> <p>But as China\u2019s slowdown intensifies, and the victims of the downturn multiply \u2013 from Canada to Turkey, Malaysia to Brazil \u2013 Greece is rapidly losing its status as the most troubling hotspot in an increasingly troubled global economy.</p> <h2>Shell\u2019s high-risk game in the Arctic<br></h2> <p>Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, was on a media blitz last week trying to prop up sagging confidence in his ability to keep paying blue-chip dividends while expanding his empire at a time of very low oil prices. The planned takeover of BG Group is an important test of the Dutchman\u2019s credibility in the City and on Wall Street, but an increasing number of analysts are questioning whether it makes sense with $50-a-barrel oil.</p> <p>While number-crunchers argue about the wisdom of that move, others are exercised about Shell\u2019s apparent determination to drill in the Arctic. Van Beurden insists the opportunities are immense and that exploration will go on, but he has clearly been shaken by the hostility it has provoked.</p> <p>It is not just environmentalists who think Shell should abandon its work in the far north. An increasing number of respected energy leaders such as former BP top brass Lord Browne and Nick Butler question its wisdom.</p> <p>Fatih Birol, incoming executive director of the highly influential International Energy Agency, has become the latest to throw cold water on it: \u201cIt is geologically difficult, technologically difficult, lots of environmental challenges, the costs are very, very high,\u201d he said last week.</p> <p>And a former head of French oil company Total said he believed the reputational damage of an oil spill in the pristine waters of the Arctic would be too immense for a company to bear.</p> <p>But Lord Browne believes the real issue is that of cost. It is enormously expensive to work in the far north, which is why Shell has already burned up $7bn with nothing to show for it.</p> <p>Our guess is that Shell will complete its takeover of BG next spring and will use the occasion to reassess its global priorities. This would provide an excuse to scrap the drilling operation in the Chukchi Sea. What began as a wrongheaded decision has turned into a huge embarrassment \u2013 it is starting to look like a worse version of the PR disaster that was the sinking of the Brent Spar platform.</p> <h2>Some people never learn</h2> <p>Remember Vodafone\u2019s takeover of Mannesmann 15 years ago? It smashed into the record books as the biggest cross-border hostile bid in history <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/feb/04/3\" title=\"\">at a whopping \u00a3100bn</a> and came amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions around the world. Time Warner and AOL were married \u2013 only to divorce 10 years later. Vodafone also came to regret the price it paid for its German rival, taking a goodwill writedown of \u00a328bn. The trip down memory lane may be one worth taking for the current kingmakers.</p> <p>If Anheuser-Busch InBev <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/ab-inbev-deal-could-unite-peroni-budweiser-under-one-roof\" title=\"\">succeeds in its attempts to buy rival brewer SABMiller</a> it would earn a place in the top 10 of M&amp;A deals. A deal announced a few days later, under which Altice is buying Cablevision for $17.7bn (\u00a311.4bn), pushed the value of $10bn-plus \u201cmega-deals\u201d so far in 2015 through levels last seen in 1999. One analyst told the <em>FT</em> that the $34.90 a share Altice was paying for Cablevision compared badly with the $8 he thought it was worth. History repeating itself?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Next Sunday, at the Labour party conference in Brighton, the battle to improve the lot of chambermaids in London\u2019s luxury hotels takes a unique turn when a powerfully illustrated graphic story, Tale of Two Cities, is launched as a recruitment tool for Unite. In a sector in which English is rarely the first language and unions are unwelcome, pictures can speak volumes. The artist behind the story is Barbara Pokryszka, who came to London from Poland in 2008. The images reflect her experience working for four years in the Hilton London Metropole, a four-star hotel charging up to several hundred pounds a night. It also tells the story of many hotels\u2019 cleaning staff who are harassed, bullied and dissuaded from taking collective action. In one illustration, a supervisor bellows at a weeping room attendant: \u201cYou are the worst maid in the world\u2026 Get up and change the bed again! You don\u2019t come here for a holiday!\u201d The maid is based on Pokryszka herself. \u201cI thought if I learned English, acquired skills, I would do well,\u201d Pokryszka says. \u201cBut every month, the criticism grew worse and worse. After a time you become irrational. You become brainwashed. Room attendants would say, \u2018They must be right. I am bad.\u2019 I never had a complaint and regular guests would ask for me, but my confidence was stripped away.\u201d Pokryszka, 38, is a poet, painter, cartoonist and ceramicist. She also has a degree in sculpting. At home in Poland, she ran her own gallery, taught art and her work sold well. In 2008, aged 31, she moved to London, she says, to broaden her horizons and develop her art. But she also needed to earn a living. She had no relevant references, no English, \u201cJust \u2018hi\u2019 and \u2018bye\u2019,\u201d she smiles. \u201cI was very happy I found a job.\u201d She talks softly, sipping green tea in a coffee shop in the Hilton Metropole, the same central London hotel in which she once worked. As she talks, her fragility is obvious and the tears, for which she apologises unnecessarily, fall often. Three years ago, she was suspended from her job for three months because her employer said she had contacted the media about conditions, a charge she denies. \u201cAt least I could afford to buy brushes and oils and I had time to paint,\u201d she says of that time. She subsequently suffered a near-breakdown because of work-related stress and has been receiving sick pay ever since. Her counsellor suggested that she illustrate her working life as therapy. The graphic story is the outcome. The two cities of the title are London and New York. A room attendant in London is likely to earn the minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour, employed by an outsourced contractor, an agency. In New York, hotels directly employ cleaning staff. The sector is about 80% unionised and the rate is at least \u00a316 an hour for a 35-hour week with strong health and safety rules and good working conditions, delivering an income that takes staff into the professional middle class. When Pokryszka began work, she joined the union, and found only one other member in her hotel. \u201cIt was obvious to me that I needed union representation,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak English. I didn\u2019t know my rights. I had no family. What I couldn\u2019t understand was why others were too scared to join.\u201d The Hilton outsources cleaning to a company called WGC Services. In London, WGC also employs the room attendants at the Park Plaza County Hall hotel, which the Observer wrote about in May. The group of a dozen or so women room attendants, all Unite union members, who work at the Park Plaza are in negotiation with WGC, which wants to increase the number of rooms the women clean a day from 13 to 15. WGC says: \u201cWe are actively collaboratively engaged with Unite the Union.\u201d Last week, the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that chancellor George Osborne\u2019s higher minimum wage, rising from \u00a37.20 next April to \u00a39 by 2020, would increase costs by less than 1% in most sectors, but hospitality could see an increase in its wage bill of 3.4%. It looks like an argument for continuing to keep hourly rates low in hotel cleaning and for contractors to employ only those under 25 \u2013 who would be exempt from the new higher minimum wage. However, in the US, MIT professor Zeynep Ton has drawn on a decade of research to show how companies that flourish, including those in the hospitality sector, pay employees relatively well, invest heavily in training and design their operations to encourage employee initiatives. She writes: \u201cCompanies end up with motivated, capable workers, better service and increased sales.\u201d A fair wage is not just an issue of social justice, it makes the kind of economic sense that shareholders ought to like too. Instead, Pokryszka\u2019s graphic story illustrates how the discouragement of union membership and improved pay and conditions is a subtle business that spawns victims while it avoids direct management culpability. Most hotel chains outsource cleaning. The contractor employs the room attendants and, often, the supervisors too. The latter are under constant pressure to ensure dozens of rooms are cleaned to an acceptable standard, against the clock. In some cases, room attendants are told to work unpaid beyond their set hours until their quota of rooms are completed \u2013 an illegal practice that reduces the minimum hourly rate to even less. Pressures Pokryszka\u2019s graphic story captures strikingly. Pokryszka reckons she has cleaned 15,000 hotel rooms. Each room has a checklist of four dozen or more actions to be taken \u2013 plugs washed; vents dusted; coffee-table legs cleaned; all this on 13-18 rooms a shift. A supervisor can insist that a job is repeated again and again. So, in some hotels, maids are denied the break they are entitled to after six hours; they are \u201casked\u201d to work their one day off in the week; the number of rooms they have to clean is increased to the point where they suffer muscle strain and exhaustion. In law, after three months, an agency worker is entitled to the same pay and conditions as a member of staff directly employed by the hotel. To avoid this, some cleaning agencies offer their employees a contract that stipulates only a handful of hours a week. The maid or porter may work a 35 or 40 hour week but that is not guaranteed. Pokryszka says that she would occasionally come into work, paying for her travel, and then be told there was no shift for her that day, even though London hotels are frequently at full capacity. She says that her income dropped so low that she was unable to pay her rent and was evicted from her flat. Pokryszka became active in the union, raising grievances about the heavy workload and encouraging colleagues to join. At one point she was offered a much-improved position and a serious pay rise, working in a block of flats away from the hotel. She turned it down. \u201cIf a rise wasn\u2019t for everyone, it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d she says. In such a system, a contractor can deny all knowledge of what its supervisors are doing while the hotel management can say that it is the contractor\u2019s concern. The buck stops nowhere. Pokryszka\u2019s response is scathing. \u201cI didn\u2019t clean the agency\u2019s rooms, I cleaned the rooms of the hotel.\u201d Have conditions improved in the three years since she was suspended? The Hilton London Metropole declined to answer specific questions about what maids earned, the number of rooms they were required to clean per shift or whether the chain welcomed union membership (Hugh O\u2019Shea, the Unite convenor, was banned from the Hilton). A spokesman said: \u201cWe select our contractors according to strict quality criteria\u2026 We conduct regular audits to confirm, for example, that at a minimum our contractors pay each room attendant hourly and not on a \u201cper room\u201d basis. If we are made aware of any specific irregularities we will take the immediate necessary steps to address this.\u201d In New York, a logo flags up to guests the fact that their hotel offers fair wages and conditions. Unite hotel workers\u2019 organiser Ewa Jasiewicz says guests in London also have clout. They can ask before they book if a hotel pays the living wage (the hourly rate calculated according to the UK cost of living), recognises trade unions and if waiting, bar and kitchen staff receive their tips in full. \u201cGuests can also advocate [places] on TripAdvisor,\u201d she says. \u201cGuests have spending power. They need to use it.\u201d Today, Pokryszka\u2019s studio is her north London bedsit. The room is dark and she has no easel. She pins her canvases to the wall to paint. Earlier this month, her work, including a portrait entitled The Lazy Maid, was part of a project called What\u2019s Wrong With Work? funded by the Wellcome Trust. Why doesn\u2019t she give up and return to Poland? \u201cI love the people here,\u201d Pokryszka says spiritedly. \u201cWhen we are victimised by the greedy, we cease to believe in ourselves and in others. That has to stop. I want my art \u2013 making issues understandable without words \u2013 to inspire people. We have to fight hard for our rights because they are being taken away from us, day by day.\u201d More about conditions for room attendants can be found at the blog Maid in London",

A supervisor can insist that a job is repeated again and again. So, in some hotels, maids are denied the break they are entitled to after six hours; they are \u201casked\u201d to work their one day off in the week; the number of rooms they have to clean is increased to the point where they suffer muscle strain and exhaustion.</p> <p>In law, after three months, an agency worker is entitled to the same pay and conditions as a member of staff directly employed by the hotel. To avoid this, some cleaning agencies offer their employees a contract that stipulates only a handful of hours a week. The maid or porter may work a 35 or 40 hour week but that is not guaranteed. Pokryszka says that she would occasionally come into work, paying for her travel, and then be told there was no shift for her that day, even though London hotels are frequently at full capacity. She says that her income dropped so low that she was unable to pay her rent and was evicted from her flat.</p> <p>Pokryszka became active in the union, raising grievances about the heavy workload and encouraging colleagues to join. At one point she was offered a much-improved position and a serious pay rise, working in a block of flats away from the hotel. She turned it down. \u201cIf a rise wasn\u2019t for everyone, it wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In such a system, a contractor can deny all knowledge of what its supervisors are doing while the hotel management can say that it is the contractor\u2019s concern. The buck stops nowhere. Pokryszka\u2019s response is scathing. \u201cI didn\u2019t clean the agency\u2019s rooms, I cleaned the rooms of the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>Have conditions improved in the three years since she was suspended? The Hilton London Metropole declined to answer specific questions about what maids earned, the number of rooms they were required to clean per shift or whether the chain welcomed union membership (Hugh O\u2019Shea, the Unite convenor, was banned from the Hilton). A spokesman said: \u201cWe select our contractors according to strict quality criteria\u2026 We conduct regular audits to confirm, for example, that at a minimum our contractors pay each room attendant hourly and not on a \u201cper room\u201d basis. If we are made aware of any specific irregularities we will take the immediate necessary steps to address this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a1a48b0beba18d817e51c618c85315a4b6b7221\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442516454502/7b474460-a821-49eb-8ba1-7c2a0f3d758c-460x294.jpeg\" alt=\"An excerpt from Barbara Pokryszka's Tale of Two Cities.\" width=\"460\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An excerpt from Barbara Pokryszka\u2019s Tale of Two Cities.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In New York, a logo flags up to guests the fact that their hotel offers fair wages and conditions. Unite hotel workers\u2019 organiser Ewa Jasiewicz says guests in London also have clout. They can ask before they book if a hotel pays the living wage (the hourly rate calculated according to the UK cost of living), recognises trade unions and if waiting, bar and kitchen staff receive their tips in full. \u201cGuests can also advocate [places] on TripAdvisor,\u201d she says. \u201cGuests have spending power. They need to use it.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Pokryszka\u2019s studio is her north London bedsit. The room is dark and she has no easel. She pins her canvases to the wall to paint. Earlier this month, her work, including a portrait entitled <em>The Lazy Maid</em>, was part of a project called What\u2019s Wrong With Work? funded by the Wellcome Trust. Why doesn\u2019t she give up and return to Poland? \u201cI love the people here,\u201d Pokryszka says spiritedly. \u201cWhen we are victimised by the greedy, we cease to believe in ourselves and in others. That has to stop. I want my art \u2013 making issues understandable without words \u2013 to inspire people. We have to fight hard for our rights because they are being taken away from us, day by day.\u201d</p> <p><em>More about conditions for room attendants can be found at the blog </em><a href=\"http://maidinlondonnow.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Maid in London</em></a></p>",
