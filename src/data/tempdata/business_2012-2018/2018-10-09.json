      "bodyText": "Companies selling fossil fuels in Britain should face a steadily rising carbon tax to tackle climate change after Brexit, according to the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative party grandee Michael Howard. In a cross-party campaign to ensure the government sticks to its commitment to cut carbon emissions after Britain leaves the EU, the two politicians said a tax should be introduced as soon as reasonably possible. Launching a report by the Policy Exchange thinktank calling for the introduction of an economy-wide carbon tax, Darling and Howard said unilateral action was necessary to tackle climate change. \u201cThe UK has a duty both to assist developing nations to adapt to the negative effects of climate change and to cut our own emissions faster than those without the means to do so,\u201d they said in a joint statement. The Policy Exchange report says Britain should remain a member of the EU\u2019s flagship emissions trading system (ETS), designed to increase the cost of using carbon across the bloc, until at least 2021. The government could then introduce a carbon tax set at the level of the ETS, which could then be steadily increased in future years. The ETS is designed to combat climate change by reducing emissions from more than 11,000 installations in the power sector and energy-intensive industries across the EU. The policy involves a market-based cap and trade system that forces companies to buy allowances to emit carbon. There has been uncertainty about Britain\u2019s status in the scheme after Brexit, although it is thought the government wants to remain at least closely aligned to the system. Should Britain exit the ETS, an independent body could dictate the level of the tax and the proceeds could be used to fund a dividend to taxpayers, the Policy Exchange says. The tax would apply to imports and domestic production to ensure the same levy is paid in Britain by international competitors to UK industries such as steel. Darling and Howard said: \u201cWith Brexit looming, a decision needs to be made around whether the UK remains in the EU\u2019s carbon pricing scheme, known as the emissions trading system (ETS). One option is an independent British carbon tax. \u201cAs climate change is a global problem and emissions do not respect national boundaries, innovative policy solutions like those proposed by Policy Exchange need to be part of any conversation.\u201d This week climate scientists said there were only 12 years left to keep global warming from rising above a maximum 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s sharemarket has hit a four-month low as fears of the escalating US-China trade war grew and the International Monetary Fund warned that the country\u2019s strong economic growth will peak thanks to rising protectionism. Heavy losses in local bank and health stocks also dragged the market down on Tuesday with little respite in sight on Wednesday. The ASX200 \u2013 which tracks the 200 biggest publicly-listed companies in Australia \u2013 has lost 2.25% in value since Friday, having endured its worst one-day performance in seven months on Monday, with the losses extending into Tuesday. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 closed on 6,041 points, down from 6,100.3 points on Monday. It is now sitting 24 points lower than at the start of the year with Wednesday\u2019s session expected to see the benchmarket index fall further. Analysts say there are multiple reasons why the share market is suffering broad-based declines recently, including rising global trade tensions, falling commodity prices and concerns about the banking royal commission. Health stocks lost value on Tuesday after the terms of reference for the aged care royal commission were released. It comes as the International Monetary Fund cuts its official growth forecast for Australia and the global economyon Tuesday. Australia\u2019s economy would grow 3.2% this year, it said, before slipping to 2.8% next year in numbers that \u201cpartially reflect the negative effect\u201d of the trade measures. Only three months ago, the IMF had been projecting the global economy would grow at an annual rate of 3.9% this year and next, but it cut that projection to 3.7% for both years. IMF officials said Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and Europe would likely hit global growth and reverberate through 2019. The escalation of the US president\u2019s protectionist policies, which had resulted in the world\u2019s largest economy doubling import duties on some Chinese goods, would negatively affect the growth of the world\u2019s largest trading countries, including the US, France, Germany and China. \u201cEscalating trade tensions and the potential shift away from a multilateral, rules-based trading system are key threats to the global outlook,\u201d it said. \u201cAn intensification of trade tensions, and the associated rise in policy uncertainty, could dent business and financial market sentiment, trigger financial market volatility, and slow investment and trade.\u201d The IMF said that even without a further deterioration in US and China relations, the global economy would grow this year at 3.7% and at the same rate in 2019 compared with the 3.9% it predicted in April. On Tuesday, Australia\u2019s share market was also weighed down by health and bank stocks. After Commonwealth Bank announced plans to investigate advice fees it had charged dead customers \u2013 a controversy exposed in the banking royal commission \u2013 and pledged to rebate $20m worth of grandfathered commissions to customers, CBA shares lost 0.87%. Cochlear lost a further 5.2% in value, closing at $191.88 a share, on news that Bose had invented a hearing aid that patients can control with a smartphone. CSL shed 4.5% to close at $188.21 a share, its lowest since mid-June. The Australian dollar has weakened from US80.9c in January to roughly US70.77c this week. But it recovered some ground on Tuesday by rising to just above US71c.",

      "bodyText": "What the hell is the European commission playing at? Don\u2019t they know they risk seeing financial markets fall off the edge of a cliff? The sober suits on the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee did not put it like that, but one could catch their drift. When the Bank describes a \u201cpressing\u201d need for EU authorities to take \u201cmitigating actions\u201d, it means the position is serious. So it is: Threadneedle Street is talking about financial derivatives contracts worth \u00a369tn, of which \u00a341tn could conceivably have to be moved before next March, a task that would be either hideously expensive or impossible to achieve. The numbers almost sound too big to be meaningful but the derivatives market really is enormous. In fact, the \u00a369tn and \u00a341tn figures relate only to the notional size of the contracts held by EU-based firms at UK-based clearers, outfits that stand in the middle of the market to clean up any mess. Those contracts \u2013 interest rate and currency swaps and so on \u2013 are the everyday business of financial markets and ultimately serve to keep money flowing and reduce borrowing costs. To avoid mayhem next March, this stuff has to continue to work. On the UK side, the Bank says we have almost done our bit. The government is legislating to ensure UK businesses can use EU clearers after Brexit. But EU authorities have not indicated they will do the same in reverse, which is astonishing in many ways. First, EU-based firms clear 90% of their derivatives in London. Second, EU clearers do not have the capacity to absorb \u00a341tn of contracts in a hurry. Third, the biggest losers without an agreement would be EU businesses. If left alone, the technocrats could probably solve the problem before lunch. The Bank and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt have a joint working party that is said to be working happily. The finger of suspicion, therefore, points at Brussels. Is the commission playing games of brinkmanship to try to drive financial business out of London? Or does it seriously believe \u2013 as nobody else does \u2013 that firms can rejig the contracts in the remaining time? Whatever the explanation, the Bank is probably sick of issuing dire warnings. It has been shouting about the risks to financial stability since last December. Financial markets have been sanguine, probably believing common sense will prevail, which is still the most likely outcome regardless of what happens with the wider trade talks. But one almost wishes markets would throw a tantrum. A no-deal Brexit, if it were to mean no deal whatsoever on derivative contracts, would be an absurd calamity. Aviva caught between BlackRock and a hard place For a certain breed of chief executive, a seat on the board of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is a serious prize. It is a sign you are a player on the global stage, fit to share visionary thoughts with similarly high-minded corporate titans. Mark Wilson at Aviva always gave the impression he viewed the BlackRock gig as too juicy to resist. He took the part-time post in March in defiance of complaints from some Aviva shareholders and the private muttering of colleagues. Doubters reckoned the chief executive of a large FTSE 100 insurer, especially one with a competing fund management business, should stick to the day job. The critics have won that little quarrel. Wilson was pushed out of Aviva on Tuesday, accompanied by praise for past achievements but also the stinging comment from its chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, that \u201cthis is the right time for a new leader to ensure Aviva delivers to its full potential\u201d. Changing the boss looks fair. The BlackRock posting was no deal breaker but it reinforced the impression that Wilson, after six years in post, was more interested in his next career move than in finding ways for Aviva to grow. Wilson\u2019s cleanup of the chaos he inherited at the insurer in 2013 was impressive and the dividend recovery was strong, but you can\u2019t live off turnaround glories for ever. The share price has gone nowhere since the takeover of Friends Life in 2015. The fiasco of Aviva\u2019s attempt to redeem \u201cirredeemable\u201d preference shares cannot be laid solely at Wilson\u2019s door since the move was approved by the whole board. But the grumble in the wings that the boss had lost the support of his fellow executives rings true. In the circumstances, Montague &amp; co had little choice but to act. When the chief executive is on a pay package worth more than \u00a36m a year, it is reasonable to expect his full attention.",

      "bodyText": "The convicted former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli is to be released from detention at an immigration removal centre near Heathrow while he awaits a judicial review of his deportation. Adoboli said he expected to be freed on Tuesday after a judge ruled he should be bailed. He has been detained at Harmondsworth immigration centre for the past 36 days. The 38-year-old was jailed for seven years in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud that cost UBS $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence. Although he was born in Ghana, he left when he was four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Speaking to the Guardian after the bail ruling, Adoboli said he was overjoyed, adding that he would take a train with his partner, Alice Gray, home to Scotland after she had collected him from the detention centre. Adoboli thanked his loved ones and legal team for their support. \u201cI\u2019m very tired and I\u2019m really looking forward to going home,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t feel elated because I know there are so many other men and women locked up in detention who should not be there. Being locked up for 36 days has really started to destroy my mental health.\u201d As a foreign national given a jail sentence of more than four years, Adoboli is subject to automatic deportation under UK immigration laws. Last month a judge granted him an injunction against deportation in an attempt to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d from family and friends in the UK. At a hearing on Tuesday, the judge Stephen Pedro noted that Adoboli had previously been on immigration bail for three years \u201cwithout fault\u201d and said he could not see, based on the evidence before him, that there were any substantial grounds for risk of reoffending or absconding. Adoboli\u2019s friends provided surety for him of \u00a3120,000. Matthew Williams, acting for the Home Office, said the home secretary wanted to keep Adoboli detained because his appeal rights were exhausted. In an earlier bail hearing, Adoboli\u2019s legal team argued that he should be freed from the immigration removal centre until the outcome of the review. But at that hearing the judge, Claire O\u2019Garro, refused bail. Speaking after Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Adoboli\u2019s solicitor, Jacqueline McKenzie, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the outcome. Now Kweku can return to his partner Alice Gray, his friends and his loved ones in Scotland and get on with the important job of fighting the legal battle against deportation. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a clear vindication of Kweku\u2019s claim that he\u2019s not at risk of absconding. It\u2019s a shame that an earlier hearing found against him as it meant he has remained in detention for 15 days longer than necessary.\u201d In his recent report (pdf) into immigration detention, the former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw described the Home Office policy to deport people who had committed crimes but had grown up in the UK as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and called for the practice to end.",

    "webTitle": "Shell boss says mass reforestation needed to limit temperature rises to 1.5C", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Shell has said a huge tree-planting project the size of the Amazon rainforest would be needed to meet a tougher global warming target, as he argued more renewable energy alone would not be enough. Ben van Beurden said it would be a major challenge to limit temperature rises to 1.5C (equivalent to a rise of 2.7F), which a landmark report from the UN\u2019s climate science panel has said will be necessary to avoid dangerous warming. \u201cYou can get to 1.5C, but not by just by pulling the same levers a little bit harder, because they are being pulled roughly as fast and as hard as we are currently imagining. What we think can be done is massive reforestation. Think of another Brazil in terms of rainforest: you can get to 1.5C,\u201d he told an oil and gas industry audience in London. \u201cIt\u2019s not what some people sometimes think: we\u2019ll just do a little bit more solar, a bit more wind and we\u2019ll get there,\u201d he added. Reforestation is seen as essential in the scenarios outlined this week by the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change, if the world is to restrict warming to 1.5C. But Van Beurden stressed that meeting the challenge would be an uphill battle, because while it was \u201ctechnically about doable\u201d, it would not be commercially viable without changes to government policies and regulation. \u201cAlready to get to less than 2C will be [a] quite unimaginable, unprecedented scale of collaboration. Getting to 1.5C is a major challenge on top of it,\u201d he said. But the Shell chief executive was adamant that gas, which makes up a growing share of the firm\u2019s portfolio, would have have a role to play in a 1.5C world. \u201cYou can have an endless discussion about semantics. Is it a transition role, a destination role? In the end it is a bit of both,\u201d he told the Oil and Money conference. He said observers should not mistake headlines on the company\u2019s forays into low-CO2 projects as a sign it was \u201cgoing soft\u201d on oil and gas. In the past year, Shell has made investments in electric car infrastructure firms, offered support to the government bringing forward its proposed ban on new petrol and diesel car sales and bought up one of the UK\u2019s biggest electricity and gas suppliers. Van Beurden said renewables would become a bigger part of what the company does in future, but it could only move as far as society did. \u201cThat means Shell\u2019s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas,\u201d he said. Separately, Qatar, the world\u2019s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) said there was no doubt gas would be a fuel of the future, even with tough climate targets. \u201cWe believe natural gas will continue to play a key role, not as a so-called transition fuel but rather in our view, a destination fuel,\u201d said Saad al-Kaabi, chief executive of Qatar Petroleum. The state-owned company recently announced plans for a significant expansion of its LNG production and exports, which account for nearly a third of the UK\u2019s gas imports. Kaabi said it was difficult to believe in the IPCC 1.5C report if it did not spell out the cost of hugely reducing the world\u2019s reliance on gas. But he denied he was being dismissive of the report. \u201cMy comment is it doesn\u2019t make sense that you could get rid of so much [oil and gas] volume unless you give me a solution that is different from just renewables,\u201d he said.",

What we think can be done is massive reforestation. Think of another Brazil in terms of rainforest: you can get to 1.5C,\u201d he told an oil and gas industry audience in London.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what some people sometimes think: we\u2019ll just do a little bit more solar, a bit more wind and we\u2019ll get there,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Reforestation is seen as essential in the scenarios outlined this week by the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change, if the world is to restrict warming to 1.5C.</p> <p>But Van Beurden stressed that meeting the challenge would be an uphill battle, because while it was \u201ctechnically about doable\u201d, it would not be commercially viable without changes to government policies and regulation. \u201cAlready to get to less than 2C will be [a] quite unimaginable, unprecedented scale of collaboration. Getting to 1.5C is a major challenge on top of it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the Shell chief executive was adamant that gas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/02/shell-approves-12bn-liquefied-natural-gas-project-canada\">which makes up a growing share of the firm\u2019s portfolio</a>, would have have a role to play in a 1.5C world.</p> <p>\u201cYou can have an endless discussion about semantics. Is it a transition role, a destination role? In the end it is a bit of both,\u201d he told the Oil and Money conference.</p> <p>He said observers should not mistake headlines on the company\u2019s forays into low-CO<sub>2</sub> projects as a sign it was \u201cgoing soft\u201d on oil and gas.</p> <p>In the past year, Shell has made investments in electric car infrastructure firms, offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/05/shell-would-support-uk-bringing-forward-petrol-ban-from-2040\">support to the government bringing forward its proposed ban on new petrol and diesel car sales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\">bought up one of the UK\u2019s biggest electricity and gas suppliers</a>.</p> <p>Van Beurden said renewables would become a bigger part of what the company does in future, but it could only move as far as society did.</p> <p>\u201cThat means Shell\u2019s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Separately, Qatar, the world\u2019s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) said there was no doubt gas would be a fuel of the future, even with tough climate targets. \u201cWe believe natural gas will continue to play a key role, not as a so-called transition fuel but rather in our view, a destination fuel,\u201d said Saad al-Kaabi, chief executive of Qatar Petroleum.</p> <p>The state-owned company recently announced plans for a significant expansion of its LNG production and exports, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/08/qatar-crisis-highlights-rising-uk-energy-reliance-on-imports\">account for nearly a third of the UK\u2019s gas imports</a>.</p> <p>Kaabi said it was difficult to believe in the IPCC 1.5C report if it did not spell out the cost of hugely reducing the world\u2019s reliance on gas. But he denied he was being dismissive of the report. \u201cMy comment is it doesn\u2019t make sense that you could get rid of so much [oil and gas] volume unless you give me a solution that is different from just renewables,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has thrown its weight behind Brussels in its battle with Italy\u2019s coalition government over plans to increase the indebted country\u2019s borrowing in its next budget. The Washington-based lender of last resort, which is holding its annual conference in Bali this week, warned Rome to abide by the EU\u2019s financial rulebook or risk a rebellion by investors that could trigger a debt default. Italy\u2019s populist coalition is targeting a deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year, tripling the previous government\u2019s target, as it pledges more spending despite a huge debt pile, which at about 130% of GDP is the biggest in the eurozone behind Greece. Brussels has rejected the idea of Italy running a larger budget deficit \u2013 the gap between income from taxes and government spending \u2013 than previously planned over the next three years. Rome is due to submit its draft budget by 15 October to the EU commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, which will check whether it is in line with EU rules. The government has said it wants to use a spending boost to kickstart investment and consumer spending to fuel growth. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, said it was important to maintain the confidence of international money markets, especially when the risks of an escalating trade war and a damaging no-deal Brexit were rising. The IMF\u2019s intervention could prove significant while both sides seek allies in the budget battle as it is considered an important ally by governments as they seek to persuade electorates that debt-fuelled spending could lead to a collapse in confidence and rising borrowing costs. Obstfeld said EU rules that prevented governments adding to already sky-high levels of debt to GDP should be maintained in the current unstable economic climate. Speaking in Bali, he said: \u201cOur concern about Italy is that there is a real imperative for the fiscal policy to maintain the confidence of markets. And we have seen the [government bond yield] spreads increase over the past months. This has certainly contributed to our downgrade of Italian growth and makes the economy more susceptible to shocks. \u201cSo we think it is important that the government operate within the framework of the European rules, which are also important for the stability of the eurozone itself.\u201d Italy\u2019s finance minister, Giovanni Tria, confirmed on Tuesday that the government planned to run a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year but said he wanted to begin \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with the EU and see a calm \u201ctone\u201d prevail. Addressing Italian lawmakers in Rome, Tria conceded the government had been concerned by investor reaction to Italy\u2019s budget plans, which has resulted in equity markets falling and bond yields rising, signalling an increase in government borrowing costs to the highest levels since 2014. European stock markets staged a partial recovery on Tuesday, with major indices closing higher following a sharp sell-off a day earlier. Italy\u2019s benchmark FTSE MIB closed up 1%, but it was not enough to erase a 2.4% drop on Monday. \u201cAlthough so far there hasn\u2019t been an explosion as some feared, we are of course worried,\u201d Tria said. \u201cAs a responsible government, we aim to explain the budget and thus guide investors in our meetings in order to calm markets.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has launched a review of the UK\u2019s auditing business after a series of scandals, including the collapse of BHS and the construction group Carillion. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would investigate whether the auditing business, which is dominated by the big four accountancy firms, is \u201ccompetitive and resilient enough to maintain high-quality standards\u201d. There have been calls for the big four \u2013 Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC \u2013 to be broken up, amid growing concerns over their dominance and conflicts of interest between their business divisions. The four firms audit all but one of the companies in the FTSE 100 index and 98% of the businesses in the FTSE 350. This year Grant Thornton, the UK\u2019s fifth largest accountancy firm, said it would stop bidding for audit work because it could not compete with the big four. The CMA chair, Andrew Tyrie, said: \u201cIf the many critics of the audit process are right, it is not just the companies which buy audits that lose out; it is the millions of people dependent on savings, pension funds and other investments in those companies whose audits may be defective.\u201d The competition body will focus on three main areas: the ability of companies to choose and switch auditors; the risk that the big four are too big to fail; and the potential lack of incentive for auditors to challenge companies because directors, rather than shareholders, select their auditor. If the CMA finds there are competition issues, it could force companies to separate their audit from non-audit activities. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said the watchdog planned to issue its provisional findings before Christmas. This year, in a damning report about the demise of Carillion from two committees of MPs, the big four accountancy firms \u2013 who were paid \u00a372m by the outsourcing and construction business in the 10 years leading up to its collapse \u2013 were accused of operating a \u201ccosy club\u201d. The MPs, from the business and work and pensions select committees, accused KMPG of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in signing off Carillion\u2019s \u201cincreasingly fantastical figures\u201d. The business committee chair, Rachel Reeves, said in the report that the big four had a \u201cparasitical\u201d relationship with companies they were meant to scrutinise. Reeves, along with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and several accounting firms, welcomed the CMA review. She said: \u201cThe collapse of Carillion was only the latest sign of a broken audit market. Investors are losing faith in the quality of accounts and the lack of meaningful competition creates conflicts of interest at every turn.\u201d She urged the watchdog to end \u201cthe stranglehold\u201d of the big four and consider forcing them to break up. Bill Michael, chair and senior partner at KPMG UK, said: \u201cI have been honest that the industry faces challenges. We all want to build trust in corporate Britain .\u201d But he opposed the idea of forcibly separating audit from non-audit activities, saying there were \u201cclear benefits to audit quality and the capital markets by being a multidisciplinary firm\u201d. The CMA review comes a day after the Financial Reporting Council, the UK\u2019s audit watchdog, set out a series of possible reforms, including banning the big accountancy firms from earning lucrative consultancy fees at businesses they also audit. The FRC also severely rebuked the top firm KPMG, which earned about \u00a31.5m a year for signing off Carillion\u2019s accounts. In June, PwC was fined a record \u00a36.5m over failings on its audit of BHS two years before its collapse. The FRC is also the subject of a government review, overseen by Sir John Kingman, the chair of Legal &amp; General and a former top Treasury official, to determine whether the regulator is fit for the future.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s Bank of England Brexit warning: The IMF\u2019s new, less-rosy, growth forecasts didn\u2019t help the mood in the markets today either. Jameel Ahmad, Global Head of Currency Strategy &amp; Market Research at FXTM says: The headline that the IMF has downgraded its economic growth projections for the first time since July 2016 is naturally not positive news for investor sentiment. There are a few ways that this news can be digested. One is to accept that expecting global growth at a rate of 3.7% in comparison to 3.9% still represents a healthy pace of growth when you consider the severe turbulence that the global economy has faced over the past 10 years. But on the other side, there are concerning comments from the IMF that a combination of trade tensions and stress in emerging markets is behind the modest downgrade in growth expectations, along with even more worrying comments that the IMF is concerned that global growth might have plateaued, indicates to a degree that there are also reasons for investors to be uneasy about the IMF downgrade. And here are those forecasts again: Trading today was dominated by the now-familiar worries over the US government bond market, and Italy\u2019s face-off with EU budget rules. Fiona Cincotta of City Index sums up the day: The FTSE managed to sustain the high note it opened on throughout most of the day despite briefly being spooked by the US markets when Wall Street opened. A mixed bag of gainers dominated London trading, some more obvious than others. Miners and oil firms drew strength from higher commodity prices and banks, retailers and insurers had a chance to rally during a lull in negative news. The Italian economic drama continues being played out with the Italian finance minister trying but failing to reassure both the markets and his European colleagues that Italy is keen to reach an agreement over its budget with the EU. The market remains far from reassured as is visible from the rising risk premium on Italian bonds and the spread between Italy\u2019s 10-year paper and German Bunds. The week is likely to see more volatility as Italy makes a decision on the government\u2019s draft budget plans which it will then submit to the European Commission for review early next week. A late recovery has helped the FTSE 100 end the day a little higher. The blue-chip index has closed at 7,237, up 4 points or 0.05%, after several days of losses. Other markets perked up too, with Italy ended 1% higher after economy minister Tria tried to calm worries about its budget. Wall Street has opened cautiously, following the news that the IMF had cut its global growth forecasts. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 40 points, or 0.15%, as investors keep fretting over rising bond yields and the knock-on impact on other markets OMG: In the markets, the FTSE 100 has sunk to a fresh six-month low after the IMF slashed its global growth forecasts. The blue-chip index has dropped by over 0.5% to below 7,200 points, for the first time since April. Other markets are suffering similar losses, as traders fret about possible US interest rate rises, and the Italian budget row. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the Italian government has sent another ripple of concern through the markets today. Addressing the Italian parliament in Rome, finance minister Giovanni Tria ended up doing little to reassure nervous investors. Though he said there will now be a \u2018constructive dialogue\u2019 with the EU Commission, the fact he called the output targets contained in the budget \u2018prudent\u2019 suggested Italy isn\u2019t ready to shift on the spending plans that have so upset Brussels. Speaking of Italy.... economy minister Giovanni Tria has called for constructive talks with EU partners over the 2019 budget. Testifying at a parliamentary commission this morning, Tria said Italy needed a new strategy to boost growth. \u201cThere will now be a constructive discussion with Europe to show the well-founded reasons for this government\u2019s growth strategy.\u201d Anxiety over Rome\u2019s plans is hurting Italian bonds again today. The difference, or \u2018spread\u2019, between the interest rate on Italian 10-year bonds and safer German ones is over 300 basis points (Italy yields 3.66%, while Germany only yields 0.5%). Tria tried to channel Mario Draghi\u2019s famous \u2018Whatever It Takes\u2019 speech, suggesting that the government wouldn\u2019t be bullied by the financial markets. A spread at 400, 500? We are committed to making the spread reflect the (economic) fundamentals. If it goes to 500, the government will do what it needs to do,. If everyone sells, we will have capital outflows and we will have to face the situation. Faced with a financial crisis, the government will do what it must do, as (ECB president Mario) Draghi did.\u201d Over in Bali, the IMF is risking a row with Italy\u2019s new government. The Fund\u2019s chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, insisted today that Rome should comply with Brussels\u2019 rules on budget deficits, rather than boosting spending as ministers have promised. Otherwise, Obstfeld warned, the market selloff of Italian debt could gather pace, hurting its economy and potentially fuelling the eurozone crisis again. \u201cOur concern about Italy is that there is a real imperative for the fiscal policy to maintain the confidence of markets. \u201cAnd we have seen the spreads increase over the past months. This has certainly contributed to our downgrade of Italian growth and makes the economy more susceptible to shocks. \u201cSo we think it is important that the government operate within the framework of the European rules, which are also important for the stability of the eurozone itself.\u201d Italy\u2019s populist leaders, though, insist that they will stick to their guns, arguing that this will drive growth higher. Back in July, Venezuelan fruit seller Pacheco told our reporters about the pain of rampant inflation: \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to accept notes of 100, 500, or 1,000 bolivares,\u201d said Pacheco, a wiry 61-year-old, whose humble stall clings to the fringe of one of the major markets in Ciudad Guayana, a city in Venezuela\u2019s southern Bol\u00edvar state. He now only accepts newly minted 100,000 bol\u00edvar notes, which due to demand are hard to come by. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s a box [full of notes] that afterwards we have to take to the bank,\u201d he said. More here: There\u2019s no cheer for Venezuela in today\u2019s World Economic Outlook. The International Monetary Fund predicts that prices in its ravaged economy will surge by 1.37 million percent this year, as its hyperinflation accelerates. By 2019, the Fund believes inflation will have soared even further, to a scarcely believable 10,000,000%, as the government prints more and more money to meet its obligations. Venezuela\u2019s plight is so extreme that the country had to be removed from the IMF\u2019s wider forecasts for emerging markets. Back in August, President Nicolas Maduro slashed five zeroes off the bolivar, and hiked the minimum wage by 3,000 percent. But the IMF clearly has little faith in Maduro\u2019s efforts to tackle the crisis, saying: Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation is expected to worsen rapidly, fueled by monetary financing of large fiscal deficits and loss of confidence in the currency. With currency reserves plunging, Venezuela\u2019s oil sector collapsing and rampant shortages of food and medicine, thousands of people are quitting the country and trying to migrate elsewhere. Venezuela is deep in recession, and the IMF believes that the devastating slump will continue until at least the end of next year. Venezuela\u2019s economy continues to decline for the fifth consecutive year, following a 14% drop in 2017. Real GDP is projected to shrink by 18% in 2018 and a further 5% in 2019, driven by plummeting oil production, and political and social instability. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has crunched data from the last four IMF reports, including today\u2019s one. It shows that the IMF has steadily downgraded its forecasts for investment in the UK economy, as a share of the economy, since the EU referendum. Prof Milas says: As the Referendum takes place and we move on, IMF downgrades its subsequent forecasts for Total Investments (% of GDP) in the UK. This can be seen here: He adds: Without doubt, lower investment spending takes its toll on the economy as evidenced from IMF\u2019s successive forecasts for UK GDP growth, as shown here: The IMF remains hopeful that Britain and the EU will reach an agreement, avoiding the perils of a cliff-edge Brexit. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, said the UK was in a position to use government funds, should it need to, in the event of a No-Deal Brexit, but this was not what the Washington-based forecaster was expecting. At a press conference in Bali today, he said: On Brexit, our baseline forecast, which underlies our forecast for the U.K. and for the eurozone, is that a deal will be reached. It will be one in which trade in goods is essentially tariff\u2011free, which would allow most supply chains to remain intact. It is one in which the regime for financial services would be, you know, quite favorable to the U.K. And I recognize that that is an optimistic scenario, but we tend to assume that when some set of economic arrangements is clearly in the joint interest of the negotiators, that somehow, they will manage to make this come about. Obviously, if this does not come about, if there are arrangements which are more restrictive of trade, which put up more barriers which disrupt supply chains, then this is going to be more challenging for both the U.K. and its eurozone partners. And there are some very critical areas where, you know, a technical agreement does have to be reached; for example, on how to handle clearing of derivatives over the transition from old arrangements to new arrangements. We know the negotiators have been working very hard. In fact, there has been a remarkable amount of progress on a lot of issues, and this often goes unnoted. But there are some very key elements that have not been resolved and that seem very difficult. So, until we get more information, we will keep with our assumption that reason and good policy will prevail. And hopefully we will be proven right. Here\u2019s some reaction to the IMF report: The Bank of England has issued its strongest warning yet to the European Union that its lack of planning for Brexit is creating growing risks for almost \u00a370tn of complex financial derivatives. Threadneedle Street said the EU had made only limited progress to protect the financial system and that time was running out with little more than six months before Britain leaves the EU. The Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee warns: \u201cIn the limited time remaining, it is not possible for companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption to cross-border financial services.\u201d Sounding the alarm over the complex financial derivatives - currently sold across the UK-EU border by banks to companies looking to protect themselves from movements in interest rates \u2013 the FPC said the EU needed to take urgent action to plan for Brexit. Failure to make adequate preparations could mean the derivatives, worth more than three times the value of the EU economy, are rendered illegal the moment the UK leaves the EU. Britain has already taken action to arrange temporary permissions to grant EU banks access to the UK market, although the European Commission has yet to reciprocate. The game of brinksmanship could have benefited the EU for shifting more UK business to European financial capitals such as Frankfurt and Paris after Brexit, although officials believe very few derivatives contracts are yet to be moved by the finance industry, which is overwhelmingly centred in the City of London. The IMF has also slashed its outlook for emerging market economies, following a swathe of crises in Turkey, Argentina and beyond. It now expects developing economies to expand by 4.7% this year and in 2019, down from 4.9% and 5.1% previously. The Fund blames \u201ccountry-specific factors, tighter financial conditions, geopolitical tensions, and higher oil import bills\u201d. It also cautions that the trade war between the US and China will drag on growth across Asia. On the other hand.... perhaps the IMF and the UK government are of one mind on the Brexit issue... My colleague Phillip Inman doesn\u2019t believe the Treasury will be pulling its hair out: The Treasury has said it needs to keep its powder dry in case of a bad Brexit. Hammond\u2019s stance is that he may need to use fiscal space in the event of a bad Brexit. He has never said there are few policy options available, as if he would just let UK crash. Likewise, the Bank of England has never said it will raise interest rates. It has said that option remains on the table. But as we all know, it is more as likely to cut them in tandem with a Treasury spending spree. The IMF has also cautioned that UK growth remains weak, partly due to uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU: In the United Kingdom, growth is projected to slow to 1.4 percent in 2018 and 1.5 percent in 2019 (from 1.7 percent in 2017). This forecast represents a downward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2018 relative to the April 2018 WEO [World Economic Outlook], driven by weak growth in the first quarter of the year, partly due to weather-related factors. The medium-term growth forecast remains at 1.6 percent, weighed down by the anticipated higher barriers to trade following Brexit. The Treasury, and the Bank of England, may not be happy with the IMF\u2019s recommendation to spend more if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. As Chris Giles of the Financial Times explains: The fund\u2019s advice will frustrate both the BoE and Treasury, which had presented a united front, saying there were few policy options available to soften the blow of a so-called no-deal Brexit. They have argued that crashing out of the EU represents a big disruption to supply across the economy, which would knock public finances and fuel inflationary pressure, requiring higher interest rates. While the IMF did not directly dispute this view, it implied that a lack of demand might be the bigger problem in a hard-Brexit scenario, which would require action to aid growth. The IMF\u2019s views could also be a boon to the opposition Labour party. At last month\u2019s party conference, Jeremy Corbyn outlined several spending pledges, including more free childcare for pre-school children, while also maintaining the triple-lock on the state pension, the winter fuel allowance, and free pensioner bus passes. Labour are also pushing the renationalisation of energy and water providers, and railways. Those policies cost money; but according to the Fund, there is \u2018flexibility\u2019 to boost spending plans, certainly in the short term. The IMF has also urged the Bank of England to be cautious about raising interest rates. With Brexit uncertainty hanging over the economy like a fog, the BoE should show flexibility, it argues: In the United Kingdom, where the output gap is closed and unemployment is low, a modest tightening of monetary policy may be warranted, although at a time of heightened uncertainty, monetary policy should remain flexible in response to changing conditions associated with the Brexit negotiations. The International Monetary Fund has given Theresa May a boost, arguing that her government has the flexibility to boost public spending. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund says that the UK has the room to ease back on cuts, perhaps as soon as this month\u2019s Budget. The Fund says the UK can spend more, or tax less, without breaching the government\u2019s own targets, arguing: In the United Kingdom, the fiscal targets\u2014which envisage the cyclically adjusted public sector deficit falling below 2 percent of GDP and public debt beginning to decline by 2020\u201321\u2014provide an anchor for medium-term objectives while allowing for flexibility in the short term. The Fund also argues that chancellor Philip Hammond should loosen the purse strings on public spending and taxation, to protect the economy from a hard Brexit. As the Fund puts it: The pace of fiscal consolidation can be eased if risks materialize and growth slows sharply. Last week, May declared that \u201cpeople need to know that the austerity\u201d prompted by the financial crisis a decade ago \u201cis over.\u201d The PM was vague on details, and her comment were criticised by Labour. But if the Fund is right, Hammond does indeed have some wriggle-room to ease the chains of austerity in October 29th\u2019s budget. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars are starting to have a serious impact on the global economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The IMF has slashed its latest growth forecasts, downgrading the US, China, the eurozone and the UK, as tit-for-tat tariffs bite. It now expects the global economy to only expand by 3.7% in 2018 and 2019, down from 3.9% before. In its latest world economic outlook, the Fund says: In the United States, momentum is still strong as fiscal stimulus continues to increase, but the forecast for 2019 has been revised down due to recently announced trade measures, including the tariffs imposed on $200 billion of US imports from China. Growth projections have been marked down for the euro area and the United Kingdom, following surprises that suppressed activity in early 2018 Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF Economic Counsellor, warned against the rising tide of protectionism, saying that without multilateralism \u201cthe world will be a poorer and more dangerous place\u201d. My colleague Phillip Inman is attending the IMF\u2019s Meeting, and reports: The Washington-based lender\u2019s economists are usually reluctant to name and shame individual countries, but it is clear that attacks by the Trump administration on the postwar consensus of open trade and cooperation over issues such as climate change has prompted more direct references to the US than previously seen. In its world economic outlook, which is published twice a year, with the latest issued before the fund\u2019s annual meeting in Bali this week, officials warned that the lingering threat of higher trade barriers meant there was a greater likelihood it would downgrade its growth forecasts during its next review. Officials at the fund said much of the decline in global growth was also the result of many developing countries being hit hard by a depreciation in their currencies, which had increased the cost of imports and especially oil. Last month, the US president slapped extra duties on $200bn (\u00a3153bn) of Chinese goods and China retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods. This followed an earlier increase in US duties on the import of steel, aluminium and cars. The warning is likely to weigh on markets today, following recent losses that have driven the FTSE 100 down to a six-month low.

    "webTitle": "Bank of England warns EU over Brexit risk to financial stability", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has issued its strongest warning yet to the EU that its lack of adequate planning for Brexit has created growing risks for almost \u00a370tn of complex financial contracts. Threadneedle Street said the bloc had made only limited progress to protect the financial system and time was running out, with little more than six months before the UK is due to leave the EU. Stressing the urgency of the situation in a statement from its financial policy committee, the Bank said: \u201cIn the limited time remaining, it is not possible for companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption to cross-border financial services.\u201d Without action, the contracts governing the financial derivatives \u2013 currently sold across the UK-EU border by banks to companies looking to protect themselves from movements in interest rates and changes in global markets \u2013 could be rendered illegal the moment Britain leaves, it warned. EU firms have about \u00a369tn of outstanding derivatives contracts that are handled through a process known as \u201cclearing\u201d in the UK, while as much as \u00a341tn mature after Britain exits the EU in March 2019. In a corner of the finance industry worth more than three times the overall value of the EU economy, the process of clearing derivatives involves banks organising their trades through a central third-party organisation \u2013 known as a clearing house \u2013 which takes on the risk of either party defaulting. Clearing has become increasingly important since the financial crisis as the EU introduced rules forcing banks to trade greater volumes via clearing houses, with the idea of improving transparency and to avoid the confusion of banks going bust with complex webs of contracts with multiple parties \u2013 as was the case in 2008. EU-authorised clearing houses must handle EU banks\u2019 trades, but UK organisations such as the London Stock Exchange\u2019s LCH handle the bulk of business and could fall outside the rules in the event of a hard Brexit. As much as 90% of EU firms\u2019 interest rate swaps \u2013 one of the most common types of financial derivative \u2013 are cleared in the UK. The UK has already taken action to arrange temporary permissions to grant EU banks access to the British market, although parliament has yet to pass the legislation with just months to go before Brexit. The Bank has previously issued warnings to the EU, but there is a growing sense of urgency. Threadneedle Street warned the EU had shown little willingness to reciprocate the UK plan with potentially damaging consequences for financial sector risk, adding: \u201cThe need for authorities to complete mitigating actions is now pressing.\u201d The game of brinksmanship between the UK and the EU could be seen as a potential way for Brussels to grab more financial services industry activity away from the City of London to European financial centres such as Frankfurt and Paris. Clearing houses need three months\u2019 notice from banks before they relocate business to another institution, which means failure by the EU to announce any contingency plan by Christmas could force banks to begin relocations. While that might appear tempting for Brussels, there are fears the EU is ill-prepared to manage the huge influx of derivatives business. Very few contracts have moved in the two years since the Brexit vote, despite repeated warnings over the risks. Senior bankers have warned that relocating derivatives contracts is akin to handling \u201cnuclear waste\u201d, while British officials believe there is too little time for banks to act given the scale of the challenge. The Bank sounded the alarm over other emerging risks to the UK financial system besides Brexit, including rapid growth of leveraged lending to high-risk companies, in a worrying parallel to the US sub-prime market before the 2008 crash. It also said it would announce the results of its annual banking industry stress tests on 5 December, which would include an economic scenario worse than Brexit. The Bank said it continued to judge that the UK banking system would be strong enough to serve households and businesses through a disorderly cliff-edge Brexit.",

Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, said the company was currently putting out messages via digital screens in stores, telling those who suffered from allergies to ask assistants for advice or to check out information on its website. He said that Greggs was considering whether it should provide shelf-edge labels with allergen information. He added: \u201cAllergies have to be taken very seriously. The challenge in our business is that the bulk of what we sell is not in packets \u2026 how do you put an allergy message on a sausage roll?\u201d Whiteside said Greggs had always relied on communication with staff in shops in the past but had \u201cramped up\u201d to ensure \u201cstaff are fully aware of the extent of the risk\u201d. Last week Pret agreed to the full labelling of ingredients on all its freshly made products after the case of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who was allergic to sesame and died on a flight after eating one of its baguettes bought at Heathrow airport. The family of Celia Marsh, 42, who had a fatal allergic reaction to food bought from Pret a Manger, have meanwhile called for answers over her death. Marsh died last December after eating a \u201csuper-veg\u201d rainbow flatbread containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free but was found to be contaminated with dairy. The sandwich chain is in a dispute with its former supplier CoYo, which it blamed for supplying the contaminated yoghurt that was one of the ingredients of the flatbread. CoYo, a coconut milk brand, said Pret\u2019s claims that it was to blame were unfounded. It accused the sandwich chain of hampering its own investigation into the death by failing to provide vital information. Greggs raised the prospect of a change to its labelling regime as it revealed a 7.3% rise in total sales in the three months to 29 September. Underlying sales were up by 3.2%. It warned of lower than expected profit margins as sales of cold drinks \u2013 on which it makes less profit \u2013 increased by double-digit percentages during the hot summer weather.",

Aviva\u2019s non-executive chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, will step up to an executive role and run the company until a replacement is found. The group said it hoped to recruit someone within the next four months. Wilson, a New Zealander, took the helm in January 2013 after his predecessor Andrew Moss was ousted by shareholders frustrated with the insurer\u2019s poor share price performance. Wilson, who is on a pay and bonus package of up to \u00a36.5m, has been put on immediate gardening leave for the next six months. However, he will assist with the transition until his employment ends on 9 April. He will receive his \u00a31m annual salary over his 12-month notice period, along with a pro-rated cash bonus for 2018 (his bonus last year was \u00a31.9m). On top of this, Wilson will receive share bonuses worth \u00a33.4m when they vest over the next three years, but has lost unvested awards of \u00a38.5m under the long-term incentive plan. He will also get up to \u00a310,000 towards legal fees relating to his departure. Montague said Wilson \u201cleaves the group in a far stronger state than when he joined\u201d, but added: \u201cThere is much further to go in accelerating our strategic development and enhancing shareholder value. We have agreed with Mark this is the right time for a new leader to ensure Aviva delivers to its full potential.\u201d Wilson\u2019s departure comes after anger over the company\u2019s plan to redeem \u201cirredeemable\u201d preference shares earlier this year. It was forced to abandon the plan after shareholder protests and the Financial Conduct Authority is investigating whether Aviva broke market abuse rules. Wilson has also come under fire for his decision to take a board seat at rival asset manager BlackRock. Wilson said: \u201cWhen I joined Aviva, the company was in poor health. Aviva is very different today. I have achieved what I wanted to achieve and now it\u2019s time for me to move on to new things.\u201d Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said Wilson\u2019s departure did not come as a huge surprise. \u201cAfter an initial bounce in the share price shortly following his arrival the shares have flatlined for the last give years. Aviva seems to have lost its strategic direction in recent times and as such we believe the change will probably be well received.\u201d Ashik Musaddi, a European insurance analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, said Wilson had delivered a good turnaround at Aviva. \u201c In line with the share price performance of UK life peers, Aviva\u2019s shares have been under pressure as well, which in our view is partly driven by Brexit-related concerns and partly related to lack of growth visibility. Aviva has market-leading positions in businesses like pensions, annuities, non-life business and we believe Aviva should be able to capture growth in near future.\u201d",

The employers\u2019 organisation said action was needed to lift Britain from the bottom of the G7 league table and it was time for the chancellor to \u201cput warm words for business into action \u2013 no ifs, no buts.\u201d As Hammond prepared to deliver the last budget before the UK leaves the EU, the CBI\u2019s submission to the Treasury said he should use it as an opportunity to tackle Brexit uncertainty. It urged the chancellor to raise the annual investment allowance from \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3500,000 for two years and to look at ways of increasing capital spending in the technology sector. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, said: \u201cAs we near the end of Brexit negotiations, the world\u2019s gaze is fixed on these shores. This budget is a pivotal moment and chance to showcase the UK as an open, collaborative and confident nation. Entrepreneurs here and around the world need to see a UK committed to harnessing the power of business to innovate and tackle problems, from sustainability to inequality. \u201cThe government must focus its attention on making the UK a shining beacon of enterprise, at the top of every investment league table and known worldwide as a country that attracts, not deters, capital and talent.\u201d The CBI said investment would be helped by changes to business rates. It called on Hammond to provide a year\u2019s relief for businesses that renovated a factory, office or store and to make it possible for firms to benefit immediately from lower business rates when property prices fall. Hammond signalled last week that he would change the apprenticeship levy after lobbying from employers\u2019 groups. The CBI said the budget should make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access funds from the levy. Fairbairn said: \u201cBy investing in workers, equipment and, crucially, digital and new technologies, the UK can establish itself in pole position for the future. This is also the best way to raise productivity and prosperity in all corners of the country.\u201d The CBI director general accepted that the failure of businesses to invest was a longstanding problem, but added: \u201cThis is not because they don\u2019t want to invest, but because the conditions are so often not conducive to doing so.\u201d The CBI said its proposed measures would costs just over \u00a31.5bn in 2019-20 and \u00a32bn in 2020-21, whichamounted to less than 0.2% of official forecasts for government spending.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and Europe is forecast to hit global growth this year and reverberate through 2019, the International Monetary Fund has warned in its latest health check on the global economy. The escalation of the US president\u2019s protectionist policies, which has resulted in the world\u2019s largest economy doubling import duties on some Chinese goods, has dragged down the forecast for growth this year and next, with the world\u2019s largest trading countries, including the US, France, Germany and China, among the hardest hit. Britain is also expected to suffer slower growth against a backdrop of trade conflicts, though Brexit uncertainty continues to inflict the most harm to the UK\u2019s outlook for expansion this year and next, IMF officials said. The IMF said that even without a further deterioration in US and China relations, the global economy would grow this year at 3.7% and at the same rate in 2019 compared with the 3.9% it predicted for both years in an interim report in April. The Washington-based lender\u2019s economists are usually reluctant to name and shame individual countries, but it is clear that attacks by the Trump administration on the postwar consensus of open trade and cooperation over issues such as climate change has prompted more direct references to the US than previously seen. In its world economic outlook, which is published twice a year, with the latest issued before the fund\u2019s annual meeting in Bali this week, officials warned that the lingering threat of higher trade barriers meant there was a greater likelihood it would downgrade its growth forecasts during its next review. Officials at the fund said much of the decline in global growth was also the result of many developing countries being hit hard by a depreciation in their currencies, which had increased the cost of imports and especially oil. Last month, the US president slapped extra duties on $200bn (\u00a3153bn) of Chinese goods and China retaliated with extra duties on $60bn of US goods. This followed an earlier increase in US duties on the import of steel, aluminium and cars. Trump\u2019s $1.1tn of tax cuts was expected to maintain US GDP growth at 2.9% this year, but the deterioration in trade and the waning impact next year of one-off government subsidies is likely to see growth fall to 2.5%, the IMF said. Germany was expected to grow this year and next at an annual rate above 2% but IMF officials judged that the impact of trade tariffs would mean Berlin should expect to reach no more than 1.9% in each of the next two years. France was the other major eurozone country predicted to suffer falls in growth in 2018-19. The UK\u2019s outlook for next year remains at 1.5% but the previous forecast for a 1.3% growth rate this year was cut to 1.1% after Brexit uncertainty weighed more heavily on trade and investment. The IMF said: \u201cEscalating trade tensions and the potential shift away from a multilateral, rules-based trading system are key threats to the global outlook. Since the April 2018 forecast, protectionist rhetoric has increasingly turned into action, with the United States imposing tariffs on a variety of imports, including on $200 billion of imports from China, and trading partners undertaking or promising retaliatory and other protective measures. \u201cAn intensification of trade tensions, and the associated rise in policy uncertainty, could dent business and financial market sentiment, trigger financial market volatility, and slow investment and trade.\u201d In a further swipe at Trump, the IMF said countries needed to work together to tackle challenges that extended beyond their own borders. Not only were nationalist trade policies harming growth but \u201ccooperative efforts are also essential for completing the financial regulatory reform agenda, strengthening international taxation, enhancing cybersecurity, tackling corruption, and mitigating and coping with climate change\u201d, it said. In a blog before the report\u2019s publication, the IMF\u2019s outgoing chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, urged governments to reject calls to bolster growth with debt-fuelled spending. He cautioned that extra borrowing would make finance ministries more vulnerable to negative shocks, which had become more likely in the past year. He said: \u201cThe likelihood of further negative shocks to our growth forecast has risen. In several key economies, moreover, growth is being supported by policies that seem unsustainable over the long term.\u201d The report echoed his view, adding: \u201cFiscal policy should aim to rebuild buffers for the next downturn. In countries at or close to full employment, with an excess current account deficit and an unsustainable fiscal position (notably the United States), public debt needs to be stabilised and eventually reduced.\u201d Obstfeld\u2019s warning echoes the IMF\u2019s review of the UK\u2019s public finances last month, when it warned the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to pay for a \u00a320bn increase in the health budget with extra taxes or spending cuts in other areas.",

      "bodyText": "New data out on Chinese investment in Australia has revealed that while the mining industry is the dominant destination of funds, investment in real estate and transport infrastructure also accounts for a large proportion of Chinese activity. And while most of the investment projects are by privately owned companies, the data reveals that state-owned enterprises account for nearly half of the value of investment due to their purchase of large-scale projects. The new data by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University has found that in the four years from 2014 through to 2017, just over $40.4bn worth of direct investment in Australia came from Chinese-owned companies. The figures show that 2016 was the peak recent year, with 2017 seeing a 40% fall in Chinese investment: Surprisingly New South Wales is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment, with more than $15bn worth over the four years. But this is somewhat skewed because investment for mining, for example, while it might occur in Western Australia or Queensland, is recorded as being in NSW if that is where the company is registered: South Australia\u2019s biggest year was in 2016, due mostly to the Chinese private gas distributor ENN buying a large stake in Santos. The data, which goes into more detail than that provided by the ABS or Foreign Investment Review Board, highlights that the level of investment from China can be subject to large variations due to massive investments in certain projects. Mining is the major industry receiving Chinese investment. From 2014-17 it received $9.9bn worth of investment, with real estate coming in second with $8.7bn: But far and away the largest number of projects involving Chinese direct investment are in the real estate industry \u2013 110 such projects received Chinese investment compared with 36 mining projects. Not surprisingly this is because the opportunities for investing in real estate are much greater than in mining and mining is also a much more expensive operation on a per-project basis. And mostly here we are talking about commercial real estate rather than residential. In 2015, which was the year that saw the largest amount of investment in real estate with just over $4.5bn, only $84.5m was for residential sites, and the largest single investment was the purchase of Investa Office Portfolio\u2019s nine office towers by the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation (CIC): So large was that purchase that it alone was nearly double the value of the total investment in real estate by Chinese companies in 2017. Other large irregular investments occurred in 2016, such as the purchase of the Port of Melbourne by investors including CIC, and the purchase of Pacific Hydro by the state-owned State Power Investment Corporation. Both of these purchases saw the highest level of investment in both the transport and electricity industries over the four years \u2013 indeed in 2017 there was no Chinese investment in the transport industry at all. Healthcare can also see large increases in investment numbers, such as when Ansell Sexual Wellness business was purchased in 2017 and in 2016 when a China state-owned company bought healthcare company GensisCare. The data also sheds some light on the investment strategies of state-owned enterprises. It found that of the 234 projects over the four years that listed a parent company, only 15% were state-owned. This would suggest that concerns about state-owned entities buying up large amounts of infrastructure or companies in Australia are overblown. But when the figures are broken down according to value, a clearer picture emerges. Just over $19bn (47%) of the $40.4bn worth of Chinese investment came from companies with a state-owned parent company: These state-owned enterprises are much more likely to make large investments \u2013 such as the Port of Melbourne or Pacific Hydro \u2013 whereas the private companies are more likely to make smaller purchases, especially in real estate or accommodation, such as the purchase of Daydream Island in 2015. The data also shows that most Chinese investment occurs in large-scale projects, with more than 40% of the projects involving more than $51m, and 87% of the total value of investment is from projects with a more than $100m worth of investment: This data gives us some very detailed insight into Chinese investment. As Philip Gaetjens, the new secretary to the Treasury, noted on Monday in a speech to the Chinese Investment and Australia Forum, while \u201cthe stock of Chinese direct investment in Australia was still only 4.8% of the total\u201d value of foreign direct investment in Australia, it is a growing segment. For the past three years, China has been the largest source of proposed foreign investment \u2013 accounting for nearly 25% of all proposed investment in 2016-17. As such, it is valuable to keep a track of where the money is going, and where it comes from. And while often the concerns about Chinese investment are more political than economic, the large investments by state-owned enterprises highlight that a very great amount of business with China is driven not so much by private enterprise but by a government whose aim may not only be commercial profit.",

      "body": "<p>New data out on Chinese investment in Australia has revealed that while the mining industry is the dominant destination of funds, investment in real estate and transport infrastructure also accounts for a large proportion of Chinese activity. And while most of the investment projects are by privately owned companies, the data reveals that state-owned enterprises account for nearly half of the value of investment due to their purchase of large-scale projects.</p> <p>The new data <a href=\"https://crawford.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/13183/new-database-tracks-chinese-investment-australia\">by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Crawford School of Public Policy</a> at the Australian National University has found that in the four years from 2014 through to 2017, just over $40.4bn worth of direct investment in Australia came from Chinese-owned companies.</p> <p>The figures show that 2016 was the peak recent year, with 2017 seeing a 40% fall in Chinese investment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IylQ2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Surprisingly New South Wales is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment, with more than $15bn worth over the four years. But this is somewhat skewed because investment for mining, for example, while it might occur in Western Australia or Queensland, is recorded as being in NSW if that is where the company is registered:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qSHQo/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>South Australia\u2019s biggest year was in 2016, due mostly to the Chinese private gas distributor ENN buying a large stake in Santos.</p> <p>The data, which goes into more detail than that provided by the ABS or Foreign Investment Review Board, highlights that the level of investment from China can be subject to large variations due to massive investments in certain projects.</p> <p>Mining is the major industry receiving Chinese investment. From 2014-17 it received $9.9bn worth of investment, with real estate coming in second with $8.7bn:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9L5P1/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But far and away the largest number of projects involving Chinese direct investment are in the real estate industry \u2013 110 such projects received Chinese investment compared with 36 mining projects.</p> <p>Not surprisingly this is because the opportunities for investing in real estate are much greater than in mining and mining is also a much more expensive operation on a per-project basis.</p> <p>And mostly here we are talking about commercial real estate rather than residential. In 2015, which was the year that saw the largest amount of investment in real estate with just over $4.5bn, only $84.5m was for residential sites, and the largest single investment was <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/real-estate/deal-of-the-year-chinas-cic-wins-245b-investa-office-portfolio-20150727-gilayq\">the purchase of Investa Office Portfolio\u2019s nine office towers by the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation (CIC)</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/X5VzD/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So large was that purchase that it alone was nearly double the value of the total investment in real estate by Chinese companies in 2017.</p> <p>Other large irregular investments occurred in 2016, such as <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/future-fund-qic-and-chinas-cic-capital-buy-port-of-melbourne-20160919-grjqzx.html\">the purchase of the Port of Melbourne by investors including CIC,</a> and the purchase of Pacific Hydro <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/china-state-power-investment-snaps-up-pacific-hydro-20151216-glp7cg.html\">by the state-owned State Power Investment Corporation.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/02/bulls-in-a-paddock-china-us-struggle-damaging-to-australia-andrew-robb-warns\">'Bulls in a paddock': China-US struggle damaging to Australia, Andrew Robb warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both of these purchases saw the highest level of investment in both the transport and electricity industries over the four years \u2013 indeed in 2017 there was no Chinese investment in the transport industry at all.</p> <p>Healthcare can also see large increases in investment numbers, such as when Ansell Sexual Wellness business was purchased in 2017 and in 2016 when a China state-owned company bought healthcare company GensisCare.</p> <p>The data also sheds some light on the investment strategies of state-owned enterprises.
