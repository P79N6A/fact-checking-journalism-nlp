      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been waiting for years to taunt Labour like this and now he does so at every turn. \"Growth up! Employment up! Inflation down! The deficit down! The number of people out of work, down!\" So runs his stock refrain in the House of Commons these days. After the long haul of austerity, the economy is on the mend. The government says its tough medicine has cured the patient. Tories and Lib Dems feel vindicated and hope to be rewarded at the election by a grateful electorate. Since the coalition came to power in May 2010, the assumption has been that recovery would deliver a \"feelgood\" factor and boost the fortunes of the governing parties. Last week the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts, predicting that GDP would expand by 1.6% in 2013, up from its previous forecast of 1.4% in August. The Bank believes the economy will expand by 2.8% in 2014. It is early days and there is still a year and a half until the next election. Yet the public is not reacting to all this good news as the politicians and pundits expected. There are few signs that voters believe the upturn is working for them and none, yet, that the coalition is more popular as a result. The latest Ipsos MORI Political Monitor shows that half of Britons feel the recent economic upturn has had no impact on their standard of living (48%). Just one in seven (14%) says it has had a great deal/fair amount of impact. Even more relevant is that 77% do not expect economic growth to make much positive impression on their standard of living over the next year, while only one in five (19%) believe it will benefit thema fair amount or a great deal. On the political front the trend is the reverse of what was predicted. As the economy has improved, Labour's narrow lead in the opinion polls has crept back up to between 5% and 10% after a summer slump that took it down to almost nothing. Ed Miliband's personal ratings have improved, particularly among Labour supporters, suggesting that he is finally making some impression. So what is going on? Labour argues that an underlying cause is that the link has been broken between economic growth and real wages. Most people's earnings have increased at well below the rate of inflation for most of the coalition's time in office, mirroring what has been happening in the US. Moreover, the kind of jobs that people are moving into are often low-paid, part-time and unstable. Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle city council, says people do not feel optimistic, even if they are in work. \"Many workforces have accepted voluntary pay cuts or freezes, and we've seen an increase in the number of people working part-time in order to save colleagues' jobs,\" he says. \"People aren't being repaid for these sacrifices. The cost of living is rising faster than wages, and the erosion of job security makes people fearful and cautious, which is holding back spending and growth.\" What is different now, he says, \"is the lack of hope in the future\". \"After the second world war, the country accepted austerity, but did so on the promise of a new welfare state.The economic crisis has deepened our country's inequalities, but there seems to be no big plan or vision for how we grow a new sustainable economy or rebuild a decent and fair society which has been shattered in recent years.\" Labour has coupled its critique on declining real wages with an assault on the \"cost of living crisis\". Lower wages must pay higher bills. Miliband has questioned the way large businesses, such as the big six energy firms, have maximised profits and appeared to ignore social obligations to customers. The energy freeze policy may prove difficult to implement, but it has the merit of simplicity for people who no longer trust markets to deliver competition that will work in their favour. Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, says previous attitudes and assumptions about economics were shaken so profoundly by the financial crisis of 2008 that people are unsurprisingly more suspicious these days about notions such as growth. \"It was so traumatic and so widely felt over such a long time that itwill inevitably affect the way people feel about the government and economy for years to come,\" he said. Jacob Mohun, economist at the New Economics Foundation, arguesthat people are right to be suspicious about this upturn.\"The truth is that this recovery is based on rising house and equity prices as money is being pumped into housing and equity markets through quantitative easing and George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme. This is making shareholders and homeowners feel richer and spend more as the prices of their assets rise. However, any initial recovery will be felt only by those who already own such assets or those who can afford a mortgage. Only if this spending has a wider effect on investment can a recovery be maintained.\" It used to be the case that the Conservatives felt happy putting faith in the \"trickledown\" theory of economics \u2013 the idea that, if business creates wealth, everyone will benefit. The market would work for all. Now post-crash, and as wages lag behind inflation and do not rise with growth, they can't do that so easily. Suddenly they look bereft when trying to answer what the economic recovery means for ordinary people. Last week the former Tory prime minister John Major caused his party another headache when he said he was shocked by the lack of social mobility in this country, one in which the privately educated seemed to entrench themselves ever more securely in dominant positions in society. Our Opinium poll today shows 51% of people think their children will be worse off than they are, and only 26% think they will be better off. The idea that progress is somehow ingrained in a market driven system has disappeared. It is not just that the link between growth and wages has been broken but also the link between growth and people's perceptions of their own chances of self-improvement. Cameron now finds himself attacking Miliband for promising to intervene in markets, while having to look at ways of intervening himself to get into the cost of living argument. The Tory MP for Harlow, Rob Halfon, who has campaigned on cost-of-living issues for years, believes it is only a matter of time before people will feel the recovery for themselves. He recently convened a jobs fair in Harlow, Essex, at which businesses looked for recruits among the unemployed. \"It was incredible how successful it was. You could really feel that things are getting better,\" he said. But the government needed to match Miliband on the cost of living, he said. It had to find ways to keep utility bills down. Three and a half years ago, in the summer of 2010, Cameron and chancellor George Osborne gambled that a return to vigorous growth in the latter half of this parliament would justify the pain of cuts and carry them to victory. Miliband and his shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, feared they might be right. But as public faith in the capacity of the market to deliver prosperity diminishes, it no longer seems like a sure bet.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gave his blessing to the recovery last week, proclaiming that it had \"taken hold\" in the wider economy. He didn't, and couldn't, take a similar stance on what's likely to happen to the living standards of low- and middle-income Britain, where there are still few signs of an upturn. What the recovery will mean for living standards is the issue of our times. Will we see a return to the type of barren growth that fails to translate into steadily rising real wages and incomes, as occurred in the years preceding the crash? Or might we see the reappearance of the benign growth that characterised the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, when prosperity rose rapidly for the great majority? This is obviously a pressing question for the millions of households who have been on the end of the biggest fall in incomes since the war. It also hangs over Westminster; the answer will play no small part in determining the outcome of the next election. It's been given further impetus after another week of good economic headlines that sit uneasily with voter sentiment. The labour market figures were positive \u2013 strongly so. At the same time, polls show that the recovery is far more reported than experienced: for the overwhelming majority it's happening somewhere else, to someone else. How long this disjuncture between an improving national economic story and personal experience remains is all-important. That will depend upon whether the structural break in the link between growth and household gain that occurred from 2003 until the crash represents a blip or the new normal. Until growth was restored this was viewed as a largely academic question. No longer. The recovery is strengthening and, according to nearly all forecasters, is set to accelerate next year. The question is: who gains? To get a clue we need to look at what really happened during the downturn. The headline is that average wages have fallen every month for four years; the pay of the typical worker has dropped back to around the level it was at the turn of the millennium. Yet these statistics cloak many diverse tales: the bad years have played out very differently across Britain. Young people have fared terribly, with those in their 20s seeing their incomes fall by more than 12% on average since the crisis, while those in their 60s have typically enjoyed steady gains. London performed well, further detaching itself from the rest of the country. Relatively high-paying sectors such as business services boomed through the downturn (adding 460,000 jobs). Low-paying sectors such as hospitality and care also grew markedly. Manufacturing and public administration took a battering. The immediate past is, of course, a highly imperfect guide to the future. But whatever surprises are in store, there are already familiar headwinds affecting the UK economy that make it less likely the recovery will rapidly reach low- and middle-income households. The jobs market still has plenty of slack, austerity has years to run, the eurozone looks precarious, business is sitting on cash rather than investing it, and millions of stretched homeowners are badly exposed to the risk of higher interest rates. The standout question is what will happen to wages and unemployment in the recovery. And here economists are divided. Some, like the Bank of England, expect productivity to bounce back and with it pay: companies will get more out of their existing workforce as demand picks up, enabling wages to climb while unemployment gently falls. Others see it differently. They point out that, despite the recovery, productivity remains on the floor and with it wages. Leading economists such as Professors Paul Gregg and Steve Machin suggest we can trace a key part of the explanation for what has recently happened to wages to the stagnation of the early 2000s. It was around this time that a given level of unemployment started to have a more powerful, chilling effect on earnings than was the case in the past. There were probably several reasons for this \u2013 from \"active\" welfare policies that made the workless a better substitute for those in work, to the cumulative impact of declining collective bargaining. But whatever the cause, the consequence is that unemployment may now have to fall further than many expect before steady pay increases return (especially in the bottom half of the jobs market). Prepare for a prolonged wage-poor, job-rich recovery. This debate is of direct consequence to when interest rates rise \u2013 itself of massive importance to the stability of the recovery \u2013 not to mention the outcome of the next election. If unemployment falls below the Bank's 7% threshold sooner than expected, while house prices accelerate, there will be strong pressure for pre-election rises in interest rates. This isn't just an alarming prospect for struggling families \u2013 if mortgage rates look like they will go up significantly before wages have sparked back to life then we should all be afraid. They certainly will be in Downing Street. What of the politics of this? As of now, Labour is on a roll. It has shown renewed vigour in its push on the \"cost of living\" whereas the Conservatives have looked unsure of themselves, dismissing Ed Miliband for being gimmicky at the same time as they've felt moved to compete on his ground. But dangers abound for both leaderships. For Labour, which has thrown everything at this issue, the risk is that momentum dissipates as the economic outlook improves. No one knows exactly when wages will stop falling but at some point they certainly will \u2013 we're not going to get permanently poorer, even if subsequent wage-growth is anaemic. Crucially, the end of the fall is quite likely to happen before 2015. If Labour inadvertently gives the impression they are betting against this eventuality they risk being seriously wrong-footed. It would also be folly to imagine that today's focus on living standards is going to squeeze out a massive election battle over fiscal choices and the deficit. The fact that there is nearly \u00a340bn of further fiscal tightening to take place after 2015 is the central fact of the next parliament \u2013 and it is one that the Tories look far more at ease with than their opponents. For the Conservatives there are also some flashing red lights. If it turns out that 18 months of growth fails to generate meaningful gains for households, David Cameron will be incredibly exposed. Promises of better times ahead would ring hollow, just as the inevitable boasts about rising GDP would boomerang. His discomfort would be compounded by any premature interest rate increases, spooking mortgage holders and choking off consumer optimism in the runup to the election. Elections tend to come down to narratives about the future: endless austerity twinned with flatlining living standards is unlikely to lift the spirits. By contrast, if it turns out that the Conservatives are able to point to nearly two years of growth plus some steady, even if modest, increases in wages and incomes, they will feel confident making their electoral pitch: \"Stick with us and bigger gains will find their way into your pocket while we finish the job on the deficit.\" For many it would be a potent message. Fully restoring the link between economic growth and living standards won't be achieved through one policy, nor necessarily in one parliament. It will require structural change in our economy. Achieving this amid spending cuts and tax rises, and in a nation of debt-drenched households, only adds to the task. This is the unenviable challenge facing our next prime minister.

Elections tend to come down to narratives about the future: endless austerity twinned with flatlining living standards is unlikely to lift the spirits.</p> <p>By contrast, if it turns out that the Conservatives are able to point to nearly two years of growth plus some steady, even if modest, increases in wages and incomes, they will feel confident making their electoral pitch: \"Stick with us and bigger gains will find their way into your pocket while we finish the job on the deficit.\" For many it would be a potent message.</p> <p>Fully restoring the link between economic growth and living standards won't be achieved through one policy, nor necessarily in one parliament. It will require structural change in our economy. Achieving this amid spending cuts and tax rises, and in a nation of debt-drenched households, only adds to the task. This is the unenviable challenge facing our next prime minister.</p> <p><em>Gavin Kelly is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank</em></p>",
