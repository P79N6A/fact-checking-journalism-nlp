      "bodyText": "Plans to introduce low-emissions taxis in London are helping create more than 130 jobs in south Wales, as the firm tasked with making lightweight bodywork for eco-friendly black cabs reopens a factory in the area. The Norwegian aluminium company Sapa is investing \u00a39.6m to reopen a mothballed plant in Bedwas, near Caerphilly, which it closed in 2014 because of tough market conditions and overcapacity. The reopening brings back the same number of jobs over the next five years as were lost in the closure. The investment, which is also backed by \u00a3550,000 from the Welsh government, comes at a time when manufacturers face growing uncertainty over Brexit. It also comes as carmakers seek to develop eco-friendly vehicles ahead of a move to ban sale of diesel and petrol cars and vans in the UK from 2040. The first customer to be supplied goods made at the refurbished facility will be the London Electric Vehicle Company, which is developing a zero-emissions taxi for the capital\u2019s polluted streets. Sapa said the support from the Welsh government helped it to pick the plant over another European facility with spare capacity. The Bedwas site has been changed from an aluminium extrusion plant before its closure in 2014 to a new facility on the same site set up to produce specialised automotive components. Although the reopening of the plant will return the same number of jobs lost in 2014, there is potential for hundreds of additional jobs in future. Production is due to start in the final months of 2017, with a steady increase over the next five years. Materials used in the plant will be sourced from Spain. Recent surveys of manufacturers have found reluctance to invest in their operations at a time of heightened uncertainty over Brexit. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, said he was delighted the facility in Bedwas would be brought back into operation. \u201cThe opening will create a range of new job opportunities and give a new lease of life to the area,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Brighton magistrates court will be the venue this week for the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding the collapse of BHS. Dominic Chappell, the former owner of the company, is to be prosecuted by the pensions watchdog for failing to give information for an investigation into its sale. Chappell, who bought BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in 2015, faces three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents without a reasonable excuse \u2013 a criminal offence which can result in a fine. A year after Chappell bought the chain, it collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of as much as \u00a3571m. Green owned BHS for 15 years, until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience. Retail Acquisitions, the company he headed that made the acquisition, received up to \u00a325m from BHS, despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. The regulator has already agreed a \u00a3363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the BHS pension scheme and halted legal proceedings against the billionaire. However, it is understood to be seeking as much as \u00a317m from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions in relation to the matter. Chappell has been summoned to appear in Brighton on Wednesday. Oiling the wheels for Defender\u2019s successor Where else to launch the plans for a new vehicle than in the pub? Chemicals group Ineos will reveal some details behind a new rugged, off-road vehicle to succeed the Land Rover Defender this week at a morning event in The Grenadier pub in Belgravia. Projekt Grenadier is the name given to the new project run by Ineos Automotive, a division of the company founded by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, who is a long-time admirer of the Defender, which ceased production last year. The company has already had to insist that the plan to build the new vehicle is not a vanity project by Ratcliffe and instead a business opportunity to appeal to the markets who would have bought the discontinued vehicle, such as farmers, foresters, explorers and enthusiasts. The manufacturers want to sell the 4x4 for less than \u00a350,000, manufacture it in the UK and have the first cars potentially available from 2020. Details of the plans for the new motor will be revealed on Tuesday in the pub, where the idea \u201cwas dreamed up\u201d. And should the audience need any libations to start the morning, the bar will open at 10.15am, invitees have been told. French Connection\u2019s joie de vivre is fading What does the future hold for retailer French Connection? Less than two months ago, Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct increased its stake in the company to around 27%, taking it close to a level where it must launch a takeover bid. On Tuesday, investors will get some insight into the first half of this year, when the company releases its statement for the period. Last March, the company reported its fifth consecutive year of losses amid weak demand for its clothes, store closures and competition in the sector. Sports Direct bought out activist investors, including Gatemore Capital Management \u2013 a London-based hedge fund that had an 8% stake \u2013 and OTK, an investment firm that owned about 7%, to add to its existing 11% stake. Gatemore had called for the company to be split up, following years of poor results. The sale of the two stakes brought to an end a power struggle in which the two investors put the chain\u2019s boss, Stephen Marks, under pressure to relinquish his hold on the business he founded. At this year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, about 53% of independent shareholders who voted via proxy were against the reappointment of both Marks and the non-executive director Dean Murray.",

Committees become fossils \u2013 requiring chairpersons, membership (a prime opportunity for corporate hierarchies), agenda, minutes and a regular schedule of meetings. When I became chairman of Adnams, the Suffolk brewer, in 1996, one of my first and few edicts was to abolish all committees except those that were legally required (the board, health and safety committee etc) and to replace these with small, informal working groups that assembled to deal with particular tasks, kept no minutes but only a few action notes, were forever changing in their non-hierarchical membership (depending on whose expertise was needed at any particular time) and dispersed when the task was done. A few had a longer life, because the subjects of discussion and action were ongoing, but none met for more than an hour. The result was a transformation in output and enjoyment, and a huge boost to my aim of making the company less formal and hierarchical. Employees were happier, motivated by involvement, pride and a sense of purpose, and the bottom line was transformed. It\u2019s easy, if you have courage. Simon Loftus Halesworth, Suffolk \u2022 The solution to the overlong meetings decried by Simon Jenkins is to hold them standing up, just as the privy council has done ever since Queen Victoria initiated the custom in the 1860s to keep proceedings short.

In fact, a development of the Parkinson efficiency rule, where \u201cthe efficiency of a meeting is inversely proportional to the number of people attending\u201d, more accurately defines their impact. Thus maximum efficiency (100%) is achieved with only one person in the meeting (yourself) and the ultimate efficiency (nirvana) is a meeting with no attendees (ie when nobody even thinks of holding a meeting).

      "bodyText": "A new warning has been issued about the growing risk of a \u201cdebt trap\u201d if interest rates around the world stay near zero, which has encouraged borrowing by households, businesses and governments. The Bank for International Settlements \u2013 known as the central bankers\u2019 bank \u2013 highlighted the vulnerability of consumer, business and government finances to interest rate increases in its 174-page quarterly report. Claudio Borio, the head of the monetary and economic department, described this as \u201ca defining question for the global economy\u201d. He noted that since the financial crisis of 2007-08, global debt levels in relation to GDP had continued to go up, raising financial stability risks. \u201cDebt service ratios are only so low because interest rates have been falling so much,\u201d Borio said. \u201cThere is a certain circularity in all this that points to the risk of a debt trap: the protracted decline in interest rates to unusually low levels, regardless of the strength of the underlying economy, creates the conditions that complicate their subsequent return to more normal levels. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the increase in the percentage of firms unable to cover their interest payments with their earnings \u2013 the so-called \u2018zombie\u2019 firms \u2013 does not bode well.\u201d The Basel-based institution has long argued for gradual increases in global interest rates to more normal levels. The Bank of England has repeatedly expressed concern about mounting consumer debt in the UK. The BIS has ranked the UK among the most vulnerable countries in terms of households\u2019 debt service burdens, especially if interest rates were to be raised rapidly. On Friday, comments from a member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setting committee fuelled expectations that the cost of borrowing could rise as early as November. Gertjan Vlieghe, regarded as the most dovish member of the committee and until now wary of raising rates, set out arguments for a rate rise from 0.25% \u201cas early as in the coming months\u201d. It would be the first increase in interest rates since July 2007,. The BIS is concerned that in countries with a large amount of variable-rate mortgages, rising borrowing costs would eat into household budgets more directly and rapidly, which would result in a slowdown in consumer spending. Borio noted that corporate debt in the US, one of the countries at the heart of the financial crisis, \u201cis now considerably higher than it was pre-crisis\u201d, although overall private sector debt in relation to GDP had declined. In a special feature in the report, Borio and his colleagues Robert McCauley and Patrick McGuire analysed what they called \u201cmissing debt\u201d \u2013 the amount of dollar debt borrowed by non-banks outside the US through foreign exchange derivatives markets, which does not appear on firms\u2019 balance sheets. This is estimated to total about $13tn-14 tn (\u00a39.57tn), exceeding the $10.7 tn (\u00a37.87tn) of dollar debt on balance sheets. The missing debt is mostly short-term, secured with foreign currency, and usually serves as a hedge for businesses\u2019 foreign exchange exposures, but \u201ccan still spark or amplify funding and liquidity problems during periods of stress,\u201d the authors warned. Another article in the report, by Morten Bech from the BIS and Rodney Garratt from the University of California, Santa Barbara, looked at how central banks might create blockchain-based digital currencies as an alternative to cash. Sweden\u2019s central bank is closest to creating a crypto currency, as use of cash is rapidly declining in the country. The authors did not comment on JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon\u2019s damning verdict of the digital currency bitcoin as a fraud that would blow up.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has tried to appease angry customers by publishing lists of all flights to be cancelled until Wednesday, after 82 failed to take off on Sunday, with the airline admitting it had mismanaged the planning of pilot holidays. However, this will do little to calm nerves as travellers are demanding to know which flights will be cancelled over the next six weeks when Ryanair has said there would be up to 2,000 cancellations. Up to 400,000 passengers could be affected. Ryanair is cancelling about 55 flights a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Ryanair\u2019s Kenny Jacobs said: \u201cWe will cancel 40 to 50 flights daily for the next six weeks, less than 2% of our schedule, with a slightly higher number initially, as we begin to implement these cancellations. \u201cFlights are operating as scheduled unless an email confirming a cancellation has been received. Cancellation notices for flights cancelled up to and including Wednesday 20 September have been sent to affected customers and posted on the Ryanair.com website. We will continue to send regular updates and post flight information on our website, with the next set of cancellations to be issued on Monday. We apologise sincerely to all affected customers for these cancellations.\u201d Martin Callanan, the aviation minister, said: \u201cI am very concerned to see all of these reports of stranded Ryanair passengers. We expect all airlines to fulfil their obligations to their customers and do everything possible to notify them well in advance of any disruption to their journey. \u201cIn the event of any disruption or cancellation, airlines must ensure customers are fully compensated and every effort is made to provide alternative travel arrangements.\u201d Seven Dublin flights and 20 flights in to or out of London Stansted were among those cancelled on Sunday. Many travellers have taken to social media to contact Ryanair. Chloe Morrison tweeted: Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, said the company was \u201cworking hard to fix\u201d the problem, after it announced a 2% reduction in scheduled flights until the end of October. The airline is changing its internal calendar as part of increases in holiday allowances for pilots and cabin staff, which has contributed to the backlog in staff leave. Ben Dodds from Newcastle is worried that his flight to Alicante on 28 September might get cancelled. He said he emailed Ryanair\u2019s chief operations manager, Michael Hickey, but did not get a response. Dodds told the Guardian: \u201cThe problem we have is that we booked all parts of our holiday separately meaning a rescheduled flight two days later doesn\u2019t work for us. If they cancel the flight, I will have to cancel the entire holiday, take a loss and go straight back to work so I don\u2019t lose annual leave and just wait for compensation. Paul Waldron tweeted: Some customers said last-minute cancellations had left them out of pocket due to non-refundable accommodation costs or with no choice but to book expensive alternative flights or transport. Others said they had been left stranded in their holiday destination. Ryanair said passengers whose flights were cancelled could apply for a refund which would be processed within seven working days. Alternatively they could rebook for free, subject to seat availability. But Karen Litton, whose flight from Knock in Ireland to London Stansted on Wednesday was cancelled, said she had been unable to rebook her flights or apply for compensation. She tsaid she was going to meet her first granddaughter, Margot. \u201cI was going to spend a week with my daughter to help out as her husband is starting back to work after his paternity leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all so disappointed.\u201d Travellers asked Ryanair on Twitter whether they could cancel their flights in return for a refund so they could book with another airline to avoid having them cancelled at the last minute.",

    "webTitle": "What will justify an interest rate rise in November? | Richard Partington", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve heard it all before. The Bank of England is putting debt-laden consumers on notice of higher borrowing costs, yet again. But this time, just maybe, interest rates could finally be on the march from as early as November after more than 10 years without a hike. While the first rise may simply serve to reverse last year\u2019s emergency rate cut, there are signals that the Bank may then push still further ahead. Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting panel not usually associated with the hawks pushing for higher rates, hinted that a rise of more than 0.25 points may be needed, which sent the pound soaring on Friday to the highest level since the day after the Brexit vote. But is the economy ready for Threadneedle Street to shift interest rates from the record low of 0.25% at which they were left Thursday \u2013 when the rate setters also dropped a heavy hint that the cost of borrowing could rise within the \u201ccoming months\u201d should the economy continue to strengthen as expected? When it did not move on Thursday, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) highlighted Brexit among the principal risks to the economy. Households, businesses and financial markets could react badly to the talks with Brussels, it said. This makes one ask what might change on this front, when the MPC next meets in November, to justify higher rates. Britain will still be a member of the EU. Ministers will remain locked in talks with Brussels. Businesses may have a little more clarity on the future of our trading relationship with the EU, but don\u2019t count on it. The economy is showing signs of strengthening, although there are still cracks that tighter monetary policy could further expose. The UK is still well behind its peers in Europe and the US, where GDP growth is twice as robust. Raising interest rates at a time when real wages are falling risks unleashing forces the Bank can\u2019t handle, according to Edward Smythe, an economist at the Positive Money campaign group. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk to consumers, who are already struggling to keep up, being overwhelmed by the higher debt servicing costs,\u201d he said. Total household and student debt is at a record high of \u00a3305bn, which would come with higher repayment costs should rates head higher. There are also more than \u00a31.3tn of mortgages in the UK, and although more than half are on fixed rates, this would be the first time many homeowners have faced higher borrowing costs. That risks putting a further squeeze on households already tightening their belts as wages fail to keep pace with inflation, hurting consumption \u2013 a key driver of the UK economy. Yes, the Bank would be acting to prick rising inflation through tightening the cost of borrowing. But wage growth hasn\u2019t fed through yet to help cushion the blow of higher rates, while the current spike in inflation may also dissipate without intervention. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch sounded a note of caution at the latest call to raise rates. \u201cWe cannot understand why the Bank would want to hike rates just as currency effects on inflation are about to fade, while domestic price pressure is non-existent,\u201d they said. \u201cThey seem to be panicking about the inflation peak rather than looking ahead to the likely sharp drop next year.\u201d Prices have risen at an alarming rate, fuelled by the drop in the pound since the Brexit referendum. The consumer price index hit 2.9% in August, and the MPC now expects the rate to peak above 3% in October, higher than initially estimated. Anything above 3% forces the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, into writing a humbling explanation to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for his failure to keep rising prices in check. He is tasked with targeting a rate of 2%. However, as the impact from the drop in sterling dissipates, inflation should begin to fall of its own accord. This might make the members of MPC wonder whether they acted prematurely, according to economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cOn top of that, we still think the Brexit risks are being downplayed,\u201d they wrote. Higher rates might be justified by a strengthening economy. Here, there are some encouraging signs. Britain now has the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s and there are positive indications for the manufacturing sector, buoyed by the weak pound. Even GDP growth is not that bad, averaging about 1.7% so far this year, which is below average for the most recent past but inline with the trend after the financial crisis. Yet there are distinct weaknesses, too. Economists at Barclays note that, while the Bank sees momentum strengthening, the consensus among City analysts has consistently downgraded its forecast in recent months. Even Threadneedle Street didn\u2019t upgrade its 0.3% forecast for GDP growth in the three months to September, which is due just a week before the MPC\u2019s next meeting on 2 November. Wages are yet to rise meaningfully, too, indicating that the output gap \u2013 the amount by which the actual level of GDP falls short of its potential \u2013 has not yet closed. Average earnings increased by 2.1% in the three months to July, although factoring in inflation, fell by 0.4% in real terms. Amid the uncertainty facing the economy, the government could help give the Bank the comfort it is looking for to raise rates. Progress with Brussels might be difficult, but lifting the pay cap for Britain\u2019s 5.1 million public sector workers is a simple step Hammond could take at the budget on 22 November. That could help to spur wage growth elsewhere, giving consumers more money to stimulate the economy. And as Britain looks set to exit a decade of low interest rates, there could be a last-gasp opportunity for the government to use cheap borrowing to invest in infrastructure, transport and cities \u2013 boosting the economy. Failure to do so risks putting years of inexpensive funding to waste. Dimitri Zenghelis, a former head of economic forecasting at the Treasury, argued in August last year for such a package, and his reasoning remains valid now. He argued that such a spending programme could help to bridge any shortfall in investment by businesses facing the uncertainty of Britain leaving Europe. The need is certainly there. Business investment in the British economy showed no growth at all in the three months to June, as firms stood on the sidelines awaiting greater clarity. Still, all of this might simply be bluster: Mark Carney was being called an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d in 2014 for teasing markets to expect a rate hike. He may want to join central bankers in the US and Europe \u2013 who face their own problems \u2013 preparing to withdraw the punchbowl of cheap money, as Britain risks being the laggard on the global stage. Despite uncertainty over the economy, the macho posturing for a rate rise may have boxed the Bank into a corner, according to Barclays. Markets ascribe an 80% chance of a hike in November.

      "body": "<p>We\u2019ve heard it all before. The Bank of England is putting debt-laden consumers on notice of higher borrowing costs, yet again.</p> <p>But this time, just maybe, interest rates could finally be on the march from as early as November after more than 10 years without a hike. While the first rise may simply serve to reverse last year\u2019s emergency rate cut, there are signals that the Bank may then push still further ahead.</p> <p>Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting panel not usually associated with the hawks pushing for higher rates, hinted that a rise of more than 0.25 points may be needed, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/bank-of-england-rate-rise-mpc-gertjan-vlieghe-inflation\">sent the pound soaring on Friday</a> to the highest level since the day after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>But is the economy ready for Threadneedle Street to shift <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england-mpc-inflation\">interest rates from the record low</a> of 0.25% at which they were left Thursday \u2013 when the rate setters also dropped a heavy hint that the cost of borrowing could rise within the \u201ccoming months\u201d should the economy continue to strengthen as expected?</p> <p>When it did not move on Thursday, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) highlighted Brexit among the principal risks to the economy. Households, businesses and financial markets could react badly to the talks with Brussels, it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/16/the-eurozone-strikes-back-why-europe-is-booming-again\">The eurozone strikes back \u2013 why Europe is booming again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This makes one ask what might change on this front, when the MPC next meets in November, to justify higher rates. Britain will still be a member of the EU. Ministers will remain locked in talks with Brussels. Businesses may have a little more clarity on the future of our trading relationship with the EU, but don\u2019t count on it.</p> <p>The economy is showing signs of strengthening, although there are still cracks that tighter monetary policy could further expose. The UK is still well behind its peers in Europe and the US, where GDP growth is twice as robust.</p> <p>Raising interest rates at a time when real wages are falling risks unleashing forces the Bank can\u2019t handle, according to Edward Smythe, an economist at the Positive Money campaign group. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk to consumers, who are already struggling to keep up, being overwhelmed by the higher debt servicing costs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Total household and student debt is at a record high of \u00a3305bn, which would come with higher repayment costs should rates head higher. There are also more than \u00a31.3tn of mortgages in the UK, and although more than half are on fixed rates, this would be the first time many homeowners have faced higher borrowing costs.</p> <p>That risks putting a further squeeze on households already tightening their belts as wages fail to keep pace with inflation, hurting consumption \u2013 a key driver of the UK economy. </p> <p>Yes, the Bank would be acting to prick rising inflation through tightening the cost of borrowing. But wage growth hasn\u2019t fed through yet to help cushion the blow of higher rates, while the current spike in inflation may also dissipate without intervention.</p> <p>Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch sounded a note of caution at the latest call to raise rates. \u201cWe cannot understand why the Bank would want to hike rates just as currency effects on inflation are about to fade, while domestic price pressure is non-existent,\u201d they said. \u201cThey seem to be panicking about the inflation peak rather than looking ahead to the likely sharp drop next year.\u201d</p> <p>Prices have risen at an alarming rate, fuelled by the drop in the pound since the Brexit referendum. The consumer price index hit 2.9% in August, and the MPC now expects the rate to peak above 3% in October, higher than initially estimated.</p> <p>Anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/12/bank-governor-forced-letter-explain-low-inflation\">above 3% forces the Bank\u2019s governor</a>, Mark Carney, into writing a humbling explanation to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for his failure to keep rising prices in check. He is tasked with targeting a rate of 2%.</p> <p>However, as the impact from the drop in sterling dissipates, inflation should begin to fall of its own accord. This might make the members of MPC wonder whether they acted prematurely, according to economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cOn top of that, we still think the Brexit risks are being downplayed,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Higher rates might be justified by a strengthening economy. Here, there are some encouraging signs.</p> <p>Britain now has the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s and there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/01/uk-manufacturing-growth-august-pound\">positive indications for the manufacturing sector</a>, buoyed by the weak pound. Even GDP growth is not that bad, averaging about 1.7% so far this year, which is below average for the most recent past but inline with the trend after the financial crisis.</p> <p>Yet there are distinct weaknesses, too. Economists at Barclays note that, while the Bank sees momentum strengthening, the consensus among City analysts has consistently downgraded its forecast in recent months.

      "bodyText": "When the boss of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bank calls a bubble, the world inevitably sits up and listens, albeit with a sense of historically weighted irony: of course an investment bank boss would spot disaster after his industry presided over the last one. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, said last week that the ascendancy of the virtual currency bitcoin \u2013 which has risen in price from just over $2 in 2011 to more than $4,000 at points this year \u2013 reminded him of tulip fever in 17th-century Holland. \u201cIt is worse than tulip bulbs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up. I am just shocked that anyone can\u2019t see it for what it is.\u201d Dimon\u2019s comments are an open invitation for derision from those who, rightly, point out that although JP Morgan may be top of the Wall Street heap, that heap is far from being the moral high ground. Under Dimon\u2019s leadership, it has agreed a $13bn settlement with US regulators over selling dodgy mortgage securities \u2013 the instruments behind the credit crunch \u2013 and its run-ins with watchdogs include a $264m fine last year for hiring the children of Chinese officials in order to win lucrative business in return. But it doesn\u2019t make him wrong. Even the most basic description of bitcoin \u2013 an intellectual test on a par with describing a collateralised debt obligation \u2013 elicits mental images of a digital back-alley shell game. A bitcoin is a cryptographic solution to a complex equation. It is not as recognisable to you or me as a unit of value as, say, a dollar bill or a prize conker. There is no central authority validating the creation of bitcoins \u2013 instead, they are recorded on a public electronic ledger called a blockchain. If you regard the Bank of England as an all-powerful insurer for the pound, there is no such institution behind bitcoin. This lack of a central authority is one of the reasons why Dimon cavilled in such strong terms last week. In the interstices of unregulated finance lurk ne\u2019er-do-wells. \u201cIf you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.\u201d Hyperbole aside \u2013 murderers don\u2019t necessarily need a digital wallet to fulfil their ambitions \u2013 Dimon is referencing a well-trailed link between bitcoin and narcotics. The currency is also vulnerable to hackers. Without a backstop central bank, heist victims stand to lose everything, as with the collapse of the MtGox bitcoin exchange in 2014. Taking out a mortgage denominated in bitcoins is not advisable and, luckily for those stupid enough to try it, you won\u2019t find a high street bank willing to underwrite it. But some of the perceived flaws behind bitcoin that alarm Dimon \u2013 no central authority, a public ledger of transactions \u2013 point to the foundations of a new financial establishment. In his jargon-busting lexicon of finance How to Speak Money, the author John Lanchester described how the high priests of ancient Egypt controlled agriculture \u2013 and by extension the economy \u2013 through a closely guarded flood measurement system known as a nilometer that was hidden behind a load of mumbo jumbo. Dimon, a modern high priest, faces a rival value system in bitcoin. It has no temple, no central authority and uses a rubric over which he has no control. In other words, it is an alternative financial establishment, whose popularity is inextricably linked with the ebbing of trust in the global system that was triggered by the credit crunch. If bitcoin fails, or is discredited, another system will rise to take its place, without the imprimatur of Dimon or his peers around the altar. First-time buyers beware: this rate rise could just be the start House owners, and would-be house owners, beware. Change is coming. The majority on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee against raising interest rates seems huge, confirmed at 7-2 last week. But the language is tightening around the nation\u2019s finances. Spare capacity in the economy \u2013 unfilled jobs and unspent money \u2013 is being whittled away more quickly than previously thought and inflation is still likely to overshoot its 2% target over the next three years. Yes, wage growth is running below an inflation rate that has now hit 2.9%, but all signs now point to that 7-2 split flipping the other way come November. As the Bank said, \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months\u201d. This was firmed up the following day by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously the most anti-rise MPC member, when he said the bank was \u201capproaching the moment\u201d for an increase. Market punters now think there is a 42% chance of a rise in November, and more than 50% in December. The current split on the MPC masks the weighing of trade-offs \u2013 between economic growth and inflation, post-referendum stability and curbing consumer debt \u2013 which is ever delicate and close to a tipping point. A rate rise from 0.25% at present to 0.5% will be no disaster and would merely represent a return to the previous record low, which had lasted from 2009 to the EU vote. But what should sharpen borrowers\u2019 minds is the thought of further increases \u2013 as hinted by Vlieghe. Inflation remains stubbornly high; something will have to be done to temper a consumer lending surge growing at 10% a year. Households might cope with a move to 0.5%, but if a rate increase augurs a sustained move against cheap borrowing and persistent inflation, then a wider rethink of ambitions, from getting further up the housing ladder to buying a new car, will be needed. And for those not on the housing ladder, hopes of a step up could be extinguished altogether. Disney hopes its Star Wars choice will use the force wisely Disney\u2019s choice of creative talent in recent years has been impeccable, having handed the Avengers franchise to Joss Whedon and employed Lin-Manuel Miranda to co-write the music for Moana. But its decisions over the Star Wars universe have unravelled of late. The director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, was sidelined during reshoots, while the directing duo behind the new Han Solo film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were fired altogether shortly before shooting finished. Most recently, Jurassic World helmer Colin Trevorrow was yanked off the final Star Wars instalment before filming began. Last week, Disney announced it was handing the final film in the latest Star Wars trilogy to JJ Abrams, the creator of Lost and director of The Force Awakens, the film that launched this Jedi triptych. Abrams is a conservative choice, by Disney\u2019s recent standards. But what the studio needs right now is a safe pair of hands on the lightsaber.",

And for those not on the housing ladder, hopes of a step up could be extinguished altogether.</p> <h2>Disney hopes its Star Wars choice will use the force wisely</h2> <p>Disney\u2019s choice of creative talent in recent years has been impeccable, having handed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating\" title=\"\"><em>Avengers</em> franchise to Joss Whedon</a> and employed Lin-Manuel Miranda to co-write the music for <em>Moana</em>. But its decisions over the <em>Star Wars</em> universe have unravelled of late.</p> <p>The director of <em>Rogue One</em>, Gareth Edwards, was sidelined during reshoots, while the directing duo behind the new Han Solo film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were fired altogether shortly before shooting finished. Most recently, <em>Jurassic World</em> helmer Colin Trevorrow was yanked off the final <em>Star Wars</em> instalment before filming began.</p> <p>Last week, Disney announced it was handing the final film in the latest <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy to JJ Abrams, the creator of <em>Lost</em> and director of <em>The Force Awakens</em>, the film that launched this Jedi triptych. Abrams is a conservative choice, by Disney\u2019s recent standards. But what the studio needs right now is a safe pair of hands on the lightsaber.</p>",

Is Rupert too powerful, a political puppet master? Hardly. He can\u2019t even get Tory ministers dancing to his tune these days. It was always pretty likely that Karen Bradley would take the long, high road of non-approval, going to Ofcom, pondering for months, then referring the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority, led (in the great and good way of such things) by a former Ofcom chair. Expect six months more pondering and ring-a-roses, with maybe a few extra weeks on top. Much havering in the marsh. It\u2019s a weird way for an allegedly buccaneering Brexit nation to do business. The CMA will face two issues. Does all of Sky, plus news-provision contracts, plus the remaining Murdoch press empire, represent a threatening diminution of media plurality?

The grass grows even longer. A regulator can calculate market shares and reach a conclusion. That\u2019s an arguably factual judgment. But how do you decide whether the toxicity of Fox News in New York will infect innocent British outlets? There\u2019s a rich stew of arguments here. Some people don\u2019t trust the family Murdoch under any circumstances. Some are horrified by the rash of female assaults and fat legal settlements that dog Fox News. Some remember phone hacking. Some are incensed by the way Fox tolerates phoney stories that keep its Trump fires burning. Some see Murdoch corporate slop seeping into Britain. Some have old political scores to settle. And Ofcom doesn\u2019t like the way the channel repeatedly promised to comply with British standards, then did nothing. Can so many assorted charges ever be reconciled? Perhaps not. Ed Miliband, a leader of the Thwart Rupert campaign, sees no regulatory end in sight. \u201cOur broadcasting code is not enough protection because its impartiality rules can\u2019t take account of story selection, tone or prominence. And an aggressive media owner can push the limits. The way to prevent ... the \u2018Foxification\u2019 of Sky is to stop the bid.\u201d Professor Steven Barnett, a long-term Murdoch foe, tears into Ofcom for arguing that broadcasting standards were not endangered here. \u201cA supine regulator appears to have been captured by its most powerful stakeholder, while a robust government looks determined to stand up for the public interest.\u201d But do Ed and the professor recognise a double-edged sword waving under their noses? Anger over \u201cstory selection, tone and prominence\u201d is exactly the beef of rampant Brexiters trying to intimidate the BBC. Ofcom, after the last charter renewal, is the BBC\u2019s shield against power plays by a \u201crobust government\u201d. Bradley, retreating into the mists, has set a profound test for British media regulation. Define plurality in an era of shrinking print influence. And establish clear principles of media conduct as they cross borders. The City and Wall Street are still rating eventual approval a 70% chance. That\u2019s probably Bradley\u2019s private bet, too. But now \u2013 perhaps more important than deal or no deal \u2013 is the moment of truth for regulatory defences built over decades. Can they be tough and clear \u2013 and principled?",
