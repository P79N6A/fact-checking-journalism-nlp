      "bodyText": "In the early hours of 15 September 2008, as the US bank Lehman Brothers was collapsing, many feared the worst, and they were proved correct: markets crumbled and, in the coming days and weeks, so did some 30 banks around the world. But few would have guessed that, five years on, the fallout from that crisis would still be front-page news. Last week, two reports into two banks that fared very differently after the crisis \u2013 Barclays and HBOS \u2013 were published, shedding light once more on a furious fight for survival in the dark days of 2008. Barclays succeeded and HBOS failed spectacularly. What both banks had in common was that their problems were rooted in the phenomenal race for growth during the go-go years of the early 2000s. The traditional caution of bankers was thrown aside and a dash for expansion, fuelled by lending and financial engineering, took hold. Barclays moved into tax avoidance \u2013 its structured capital markets division generated more than \u00a31bn in revenue in the four years to 2010 \u2013 and failed to stop its traders rigging the Libor interest rate, which eventually resulted in a \u00a3290m fine. The two reports could not be more different. The 244 pages detailing the cultural crisis inside Barclays were commissioned by the bank itself, as a demonstration of its determination to clean up its act. It employed a lawyer \u2013 City grandee Anthony Salz, a director of the Scott Trust, which owns the Observer \u2013 to investigate how and why standards had hit rock bottom. Salz interviewed 600 individuals in nine months, although none is quoted even anonymously in the analysis. On its way to making 34 recommendations, the report concludes that the bank overpaid its staff, chased an ambition to become a top five player at all cost and failed to make its 140,000 staff understand they worked for the same organisation. Barclays' new chairman, Sir David Walker, who is writing a cheque for \u00a317m to cover the costs of the review, described its contents as \"uncomfortable reading at times\". In contrast, the 96 pages on HBOS produced by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, whose members include MPs and peers and the new archbishop of Canterbury, was an excoriating attack on the incompetence of the three men at the bank's helm. It pulled no punches and called for City regulators to conduct an investigation into whether the three \u2013 long-standing chairman Lord Stevenson, and chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby \u2013 should be banned from the City for life. None has commented on the scathing attack on their \"toxic\" mistakes. Just how much the HBOS report has cost the taxpayer is unclear, but it will be a fraction of the Barclays bill. HBOS did not survive the Lehman fallout: within three days it had been rescued by Lloyds TSB. A month later, it was bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers' cash. Barclays did scrape through, but only by going cap in hand to Middle Eastern investors; the circumstances of that venture are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Salz describes this desperate battle to avoid a bailout as making Barclays look \"too clever by half\", damaging its relationship with overstretched regulators and its own investors. While HBOS was being rescued, Barclays was still chasing growth, snapping up the Wall Street operations of the collapsed Lehman Brothers \u2013 a move that Salz said added to the management challenges facing a bank that was already stretched. Stories had circulated for years about splits inside Barclays. The high street tellers felt no link to Bob Diamond's casino operations, which the report said had a win-at-all-costs attitude that came to dominate the organisation. Diamond's chief operating officer, Paul Idzik, was infamous for his behaviour, which included cutting off people's ties and snapping pens that did not bear the company logo. But the Salz report shows the retail bank was not blameless either. Salz details a culture of fear that pervaded the division when it was run by the Dutchman Frits Seegers, who left suddenly in 2009. Sales targets were tough, and staff incentivised to push loans with profitable payment protection insurance (PPI) attached. Diamond and Seegers were put in charge of the two big businesses inside Barclays by the then chief executive John Varley, who failed to prevent them running the two divisions as separate silos. Salz said that while this was not Varley's intention, he had failed to create a \"cohesive\" top team. Barclays's new boss, Antony Jenkins, who is trying to reinvent the bank, is not entirely spared criticism either. It is not levelled directly at him, but Jenkins ran the Barclaycard operation that sold millions of pounds of useless PPI to cardholders. At HBOS, there was no hope of surviving the Lehman fallout. In fact, the parliamentary report makes it clear that it would have gone bust even if there had been no financial crisis because of the \u00a347bn of losses racked up in just three of its divisions. Only one person \u2013 Peter Cummings, who ran the HBOS corporate lending arm \u2013 has so far faced any official sanction. At Barclays, the SFO continues to investigate former and current executives. But at HBOS, the chances of action seem slim. Crosby quit as an adviser to private equity group Bridgepoint after the report was published and is under pressure to relinquish his seat on the board at caterer Compass. Hornby has a top job at bookmaker Coral and Stevenson continues to hold directorships at the Tate and Glyndebourne. A three-year rule makes it difficult for City regulators to take any action against the trio. In addition, the Financial Services Authority closed its enforcement investigation last year when Cummings was fined \u2013 even though it is yet to publish its own report into the catastrophe.",

      "bodyText": "When David Jay became frustrated by his inability to find out what was on the school lunch menu, he took action in the way only a technically minded 11-year-old would \u2013 he decided to create an app for it. David would have won the approval of Dick Olver, chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, who last month attacked the Department for Education's proposed new design and technology curriculum for focusing on cookery and gardening and not meeting \"the needs of a technologically literate society\". Olver is not alone. Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, has complained that Britain's ICT curriculum gives pupils no insight into how software is made, and Mike Short, president of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, has said computer science must be taught as a subject in schools or the UK could lose its globally competitive position. Young David's idea was to take the food choices from the menu published online by the independent Thomas's school in Battersea and write a program for his phone to display what they would be eating that day. But, in apparent confirmation of Olver's concerns, the school can take no credit. The app idea emerged not in a classroom but on a Saturday afternoon in the offices of Forward, a web company in Camden, north London, which hosts monthly session teaching children computer skills, including writing code. This Coder Dojo \u2013 which borrows the Japanese term for a martial arts school \u2013 is one of 180 around the world. From Brooklyn to Uganda to Bolivia, IT professionals are giving up their spare time to teach children as young as seven how to become tech wizards. Started two years ago by a young Irish computer enthusiast, James Whelton, the movement has spread rapidly, with an ethos of volunteer-led teaching in an industry increasingly concerned by a shortage of skills in information and communication technology, or ICT. At the Camden dojo, 15 other children, parents in tow, are being mentored by professionals as they work on their projects for three hours on a Saturday afternoon. Andy Kent, one of the Camden mentors, says the dojos do not focus on teaching particular skills, but allow children to question how technology works. It is the modern-day equivalent of taking a radio apart and putting it back together. \"I think there is a certain stigma attached to coding,\" he says. \"If you like football, you go and do more of it at the weekend, but we don't really have that for tech stuff, or any academic things.\" David's father is Alan Jay, one of the founders of film database IMDb before it was sold to Amazon in 1998. He says: \"It is a logic and a language, just like learning French, and if you teach them when they are young, they don't think they're learning something complicated.\" Michael Gottlieb, an IT manager whose son Josh is at the dojo building an interactive game, says one of his fears is that in schools, children are taught how to use products such as Word and Excel, but not what goes on behind them: \"It is the difference between being able to drive a car and knowing what goes on under the bonnet.\" The Coder Dojo movement was born out of a mixture of these frustrations two years ago. Whelton, then an 18-year-old computer enthusiast who had run a computer club in his secondary school in Cork, co-founded the movement with Bill Liao, an Australian entrepreneur who was concerned about the skills gap. It soon mushroomed through, naturally enough, Twitter and Facebook. \"This was not being done in schools,\" Whelton says. \"As a young person who wasn't academic, wasn't sporty and couldn't play guitar, computers were my thing. And not having that outlet in school was incredibly frustrating.\" Dojo sessions have been held at sites as varied as the European parliament building in Brussels and a rural island off Ireland's west coast, but they have attracted international attention. Last December, Forbes magazine named Whelton one of \"30 under 30\" to watch in 2013. One Dojo student went on to develop a game called Pizzabot that topped the iPhone paid-for download charts in 2011. BAE's Olver is merely echoing frustration among IT professionals about the teaching of coding skills. A year ago John Naughton, emeritus professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University and Observer technology columnist, wrote an open letter to education secretary, Michael Gove, calling for a radical \"reboot\" of computer science teaching in schools. A spokesman for Gove says that in the past year the DfE has scrapped the outdated ICT curriculum and is consulting on a new one under which children from age five will learn to write code. \"We have also recognised the importance of computer science by including it in the EBacc, and we are enticing top graduates to teach computer science with a \u00a320,000 scholarship programme,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>When David Jay became frustrated by his inability to find out what was on the school lunch menu, he took action in the way only a technically minded 11-year-old would \u2013 he decided to create an app for it.</p> <p>David would have won the approval of Dick Olver, chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, who last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/31/school-curriculum-cookery-horticulture-before-technology\" title=\"\">attacked the Department for Education's proposed new design and technology curriculum</a> for focusing on cookery and gardening and not meeting \"the needs of a technologically literate society\".</p> <p>Olver is not alone. Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, has complained that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/26/eric-schmidt-chairman-google-education\" title=\"\">Britain's ICT curriculum gives pupils no insight into how software is made</a>, and Mike Short, president of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/20/ict-teaching-programming-no-guidance\" title=\"\">computer science must be taught as a subject in schools</a> or the UK could lose its globally competitive position.</p> <p>Young David's idea was to take the food choices from the menu published online by the independent Thomas's school in Battersea and write a program for his phone to display what they would be eating that day. But, in apparent confirmation of Olver's concerns, the school can take no credit. The app idea emerged not in a classroom but on a Saturday afternoon in the offices of <a href=\"http://www.forward.co.uk/forward-foundation\" title=\"\">Forward</a>, a web company in Camden, north London, which hosts monthly session teaching children computer skills, including writing code.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://coderdojo.com/\" title=\"\">Coder Dojo</a> \u2013 which borrows the Japanese term for a martial arts school \u2013 is one of 180 around the world. From Brooklyn to Uganda to Bolivia, IT professionals are giving up their spare time to teach children as young as seven how to become tech wizards.</p> <p>Started two years ago by a young Irish computer enthusiast, James Whelton, the movement has spread rapidly, with an ethos of volunteer-led teaching in an industry increasingly concerned by a shortage of skills in information and communication technology, or ICT.</p> <p>At the Camden dojo, 15 other children, parents in tow, are being mentored by professionals as they work on their projects for three hours on a Saturday afternoon. Andy Kent, one of the Camden mentors, says the dojos do not focus on teaching particular skills, but allow children to question how technology works. It is the modern-day equivalent of taking a radio apart and putting it back together.</p> <p>\"I think there is a certain stigma attached to coding,\" he says. \"If you like football, you go and do more of it at the weekend, but we don't really have that for tech stuff, or any academic things.\"</p> <p>David's father is Alan Jay, one of the founders of film database IMDb before it was sold to Amazon in 1998. He says: \"It is a logic and a language, just like learning French, and if you teach them when they are young, they don't think they're learning something complicated.\"</p> <p>Michael Gottlieb, an IT manager whose son Josh is at the dojo building an interactive game, says one of his fears is that in schools, children are taught how to use products such as Word and Excel, but not what goes on behind them: \"It is the difference between being able to drive a car and knowing what goes on under the bonnet.\"</p> <p>The Coder Dojo movement was born out of a mixture of these frustrations two years ago. Whelton, then an 18-year-old computer enthusiast who had run a computer club in his secondary school in Cork, co-founded the movement with Bill Liao, an Australian entrepreneur who was concerned about the skills gap. It soon mushroomed through, naturally enough, Twitter and Facebook.</p> <p>\"This was not being done in schools,\" Whelton says. \"As a young person who wasn't academic, wasn't sporty and couldn't play guitar, computers were my thing. And not having that outlet in school was incredibly frustrating.\"</p> <p>Dojo sessions have been held at sites as varied as the European parliament building in Brussels and a rural island off Ireland's west coast, but they have attracted international attention. Last December, <em>Forbes</em> magazine <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekeg45kfk/james-whelton-20/\" title=\"\">named Whelton one of \"30 under 30\"</a> to watch in 2013. One Dojo student went on to develop a game called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImJD-nDxnc4\" title=\"\">Pizzabot</a> that topped the iPhone paid-for download charts in 2011.</p> <p>BAE's Olver is merely echoing frustration among IT professionals about the teaching of coding skills. A year ago John Naughton, emeritus professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University and <em>Observer</em> technology columnist, wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/manifesto-teaching-ict-education-minister\" title=\"\">an open letter</a> to education secretary, Michael Gove, calling for a radical \"reboot\" of computer science teaching in schools.</p> <p>A spokesman for Gove says that in the past year the DfE has scrapped the outdated ICT curriculum and is consulting on a new one under which children from age five will learn to write code.</p> <p>\"We have also recognised the importance of computer science by including it in the EBacc, and we are enticing top graduates to teach computer science with a \u00a320,000 scholarship programme,\" he says.</p> <p>Nonetheless, BAE's Olver is adamant that \"something has gone very wrong\" with the new national design and technology curriculum, which includes cookery and horticulture, but leaves out computer-aided design and electronics.</p> <p>So in an unintended adoption of the big society principles trumpeted by Gove and his colleagues, volunteers are filling the gap.

      "standfirst": "The stricken lender saw and ran itself as a 'challenger bank' \u2013 just like the ones the government is hoping will enter the market now", 
      "body": "<p>There is a shocking story that has still not been properly told. It concerns how the Halifax, a staid former building society, and safe-as-houses Scottish institution Bank of Scotland could embark on a \u00a330bn merger and collapse just seven years later \u2013 with all of that value completely wiped out \u2013 into the arms of Lloyds, with a \u00a320bn injection from the taxpayer to prevent it crashing.</p> <p>The parliamentary commission on banking standards <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/05/hbos-bank-that-couldnt-say-no\" title=\"\">made a good stab at it last week</a>. The trio at the top \u2013 Lord Stevenson, the bank's chairman \"from its birth to its death\" and successive chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby \u2013 were roundly blamed for the colossal failures that led to its collapse.</p> <p>Its risk department, with power devolved to individual business heads, was unable to keep pace with lending that grew so quickly that, by the time the bank collapsed in 2008, the gap between loans and deposits had exploded to an eyewatering \u00a3213bn.</p> <p>Stevenson et al may insist the bank was brought down by the seizure in the markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but the reality is that out-of-control lending by a gung-ho management team caused its demise.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority identified the problem in 2004, even gifting the commission the title for its report \u2013 An Accident Waiting to Happen \u2013 but the watchdog failed to to stop it. As the commission put it, the FSA did bark, but it barked up the wrong tree.</p> <p>What the commission did not tackle is exactly what happened in the three days from the Lehman Brothers collapse to the announcement that HBOS would be rescued by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>It does provide some insight into why the rescue was needed: a former HBOS banker told the commission that \u00a335bn of deposits from big companies were pulled out of the bank in the wake of the Lehman collapse. It was not a Northern Rock-style panic, where ordinary savers queued up to take out their cash, but a vast and silent run on the bank by big businesses in the know.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that behind the scenes the government was racing to save the crumbling institution. HBOS owned the biggest mortgage lender in the country, Halifax, which was also the home to as many as 20% of the nation's savers. The size of the problem was too big for a nationalisation, so organising a suitable rescue \u2013 dressed up as a friendly merger \u2013 was by far the more palatable solution, even though it required the tearing-up of competition rules that at any other moment would have banned such a deal.</p> <p>At the time, no one could have realised the scale of the problem about to unfold. In the first version of the proposal, Hornby was even allowed to keep his job \u2013 although he was axed just a month later when the bottom fell out the banking industry and RBS was also bailed out by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The truth about the influence of Gordon Brown, who is said to have discussed the deal over cocktails with Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank in the hours immediately after the Lehman collapse, has not yet been revealed. But it needs to be if the real story of the HBOS demise is to be properly understood. Surely we won't have to wait 30 years for the cabinet papers?</p> <p>There is also a lesson in the story for the new government, so eager to promote competition on the high street. In its first annual report, HBOS described itself as a \"challenger bank\" to the big four \u2013 something for which it was widely congratulated. Sound familiar? It is a phrase that coalition ministers like to use to encourage new entrants on to a high street still dominated by that same big four.</p> <p>The government's answer is to make it easier for new banks to set up by loosening capital requirements to get new players off the ground. In the light of the HBOS report, that must be one policy that needs a rethink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-406769623\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/6/1365245217138/Japans-quantitative-easin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Japan's quantitative easing cartoon by David Simonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan's quantitative easing cartoon by David Simonds Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>This crisis called for something a bit more super, Mario</h2> <p>Perhaps it was unfortunate for European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that his monthly press conference last week came hot on the heels of Japan's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/04/japan-quantitative-easing-70bn\" title=\"\">shock-and-awe announcement of $1.4&#xa0;trillion in quantitative easing</a>.</p> <p>After Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's new central bank governor, promised to double the size of the country's monetary base in a bold bid to banish deflation, anything Draghi had to offer would be seen as a damp squib.</p> <p>But he could have offered something. Interest rates in the eurozone, at 0.75%, are higher than in the US, UK or Japan; and while Draghi has promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to hold the euro together, no country has yet triggered his policy of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/06/eurozone-crisis-mario-draghi-ecb-euro\" title=\"\">outright monetary transactions</a>\", or unlimited ECB bond-buying. That would anyway do little to solve his two most pressing problems: the crisis in Cyprus and the downturn in eurozone economies.</p> <p>Since the ECB last met, Cyprus has collapsed into a botched bailout and forced its government to impose draconian capital controls, thereby shattering the illusion that a euro in one place (a Cypriot bank account, say) is worth the same as a euro anywhere else (a German shopper's pocket, for example). At the same time, data suggests the eurozone recession has continued into a sixth successive quarter, which would make it longer than the \"Great Contraction\" of 2008-09.</p> <p>Yet the best Draghi had to offer was a limp promise that Cyprus would not be the template for future bailouts, an insistence \u2013 familiar to British voters \u2013 that there is \"no Plan B\", and a few hints that the ECB might, just possibly, consider a rate cut in the coming months.</p> <p>Japan's all-guns-blazing approach is risky, and it may well fail to achieve prime minister Shinzo Abe's target of 2% inflation within two years. But it's a lot more reassuring than Draghi's pledge to \"stand ready to act\".</p> <h2>Bad weather adds to Bolland's woes</h2> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland may be the one retail leader with reason to be grateful for the icy chill hanging over Britain's high streets. The weather gives him a welcome \u2013 and probably genuine \u2013 excuse for a continuing fall in clothing sales, and may help him keep his job a while longer.</p> <p>Bolland, who will provide a trading update on Thursday, is under pressure to improve performance after a disappointing Christmas and evidence that his overseas ambitions have stalled.</p> <p>Analysts are expecting sales of clothing and homewares in stores open more than a year to have fallen by 4.5% in the three months to March, even worse than the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/09/marks-and-spencer-sales-fall-christmas\" title=\"\">3.8% revealed in January</a>. Some of that is undoubtedly the result of the unseasonable chill compared with last year's balmy March. But M&amp;S's fashions have been getting a chilly reception from shoppers for some time and the chain is losing customers to rivals.</p> <p>Bolland is promising a revival in clothing from late summer, when we will begin to see the work of his crack new team, led by M&amp;S's own Mr Fix-it, John Dixon, and including former Debenhams boss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/20/belinda-earl-m-and-s-style-director\" title=\"\">Belinda Earl</a>.</p> <p>M&amp;S's food business is holding up well, with analysts expecting a 3% lift in underlying sales. Food sales have benefited from shoppers' concerns about the horsemeat scandal, and that should buy Bolland some time.</p> <p>But how will long investors go on putting their concerns on ice? Sadly, M&amp;S's problems go well beyond knitwear styling. It is spending a fortune on attempts to modernise its distribution and IT systems. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/10/marks-and-spencer-sales-figures-leak\" title=\"\">leak of its grim Christmas trading figures</a> fuelled rumours of disquiet within management, already unsettled by a spate of departures, and ventures in China and France are struggling.</p> <p>All this adds up to another year of falling profits. The lack of outrage when rumours of a bid from Qatar emerged a few weeks ago spoke volumes. Unfortunately, investors hoping that a white knight might ride out of the desert look set to be disappointed.

It concerns how the Halifax, a staid former building society, and safe-as-houses Scottish institution Bank of Scotland could embark on a \u00a330bn merger and collapse just seven years later \u2013 with all of that value completely wiped out \u2013 into the arms of Lloyds, with a \u00a320bn injection from the taxpayer to prevent it crashing. The parliamentary commission on banking standards made a good stab at it last week. The trio at the top \u2013 Lord Stevenson, the bank's chairman \"from its birth to its death\" and successive chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby \u2013 were roundly blamed for the colossal failures that led to its collapse. Its risk department, with power devolved to individual business heads, was unable to keep pace with lending that grew so quickly that, by the time the bank collapsed in 2008, the gap between loans and deposits had exploded to an eyewatering \u00a3213bn. Stevenson et al may insist the bank was brought down by the seizure in the markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but the reality is that out-of-control lending by a gung-ho management team caused its demise. The Financial Services Authority identified the problem in 2004, even gifting the commission the title for its report \u2013 An Accident Waiting to Happen \u2013 but the watchdog failed to to stop it. As the commission put it, the FSA did bark, but it barked up the wrong tree. What the commission did not tackle is exactly what happened in the three days from the Lehman Brothers collapse to the announcement that HBOS would be rescued by Lloyds TSB. It does provide some insight into why the rescue was needed: a former HBOS banker told the commission that \u00a335bn of deposits from big companies were pulled out of the bank in the wake of the Lehman collapse. It was not a Northern Rock-style panic, where ordinary savers queued up to take out their cash, but a vast and silent run on the bank by big businesses in the know. Little wonder, then, that behind the scenes the government was racing to save the crumbling institution. HBOS owned the biggest mortgage lender in the country, Halifax, which was also the home to as many as 20% of the nation's savers. The size of the problem was too big for a nationalisation, so organising a suitable rescue \u2013 dressed up as a friendly merger \u2013 was by far the more palatable solution, even though it required the tearing-up of competition rules that at any other moment would have banned such a deal. At the time, no one could have realised the scale of the problem about to unfold. In the first version of the proposal, Hornby was even allowed to keep his job \u2013 although he was axed just a month later when the bottom fell out the banking industry and RBS was also bailed out by the taxpayer. The truth about the influence of Gordon Brown, who is said to have discussed the deal over cocktails with Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank in the hours immediately after the Lehman collapse, has not yet been revealed. But it needs to be if the real story of the HBOS demise is to be properly understood. Surely we won't have to wait 30 years for the cabinet papers? There is also a lesson in the story for the new government, so eager to promote competition on the high street. In its first annual report, HBOS described itself as a \"challenger bank\" to the big four \u2013 something for which it was widely congratulated. Sound familiar? It is a phrase that coalition ministers like to use to encourage new entrants on to a high street still dominated by that same big four. The government's answer is to make it easier for new banks to set up by loosening capital requirements to get new players off the ground. In the light of the HBOS report, that must be one policy that needs a rethink. This crisis called for something a bit more super, Mario Perhaps it was unfortunate for European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that his monthly press conference last week came hot on the heels of Japan's shock-and-awe announcement of $1.4 trillion in quantitative easing. After Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's new central bank governor, promised to double the size of the country's monetary base in a bold bid to banish deflation, anything Draghi had to offer would be seen as a damp squib. But he could have offered something. Interest rates in the eurozone, at 0.75%, are higher than in the US, UK or Japan; and while Draghi has promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to hold the euro together, no country has yet triggered his policy of \"outright monetary transactions\", or unlimited ECB bond-buying. That would anyway do little to solve his two most pressing problems: the crisis in Cyprus and the downturn in eurozone economies. Since the ECB last met, Cyprus has collapsed into a botched bailout and forced its government to impose draconian capital controls, thereby shattering the illusion that a euro in one place (a Cypriot bank account, say) is worth the same as a euro anywhere else (a German shopper's pocket, for example). At the same time, data suggests the eurozone recession has continued into a sixth successive quarter, which would make it longer than the \"Great Contraction\" of 2008-09. Yet the best Draghi had to offer was a limp promise that Cyprus would not be the template for future bailouts, an insistence \u2013 familiar to British voters \u2013 that there is \"no Plan B\", and a few hints that the ECB might, just possibly, consider a rate cut in the coming months. Japan's all-guns-blazing approach is risky, and it may well fail to achieve prime minister Shinzo Abe's target of 2% inflation within two years. But it's a lot more reassuring than Draghi's pledge to \"stand ready to act\". Bad weather adds to Bolland's woes Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland may be the one retail leader with reason to be grateful for the icy chill hanging over Britain's high streets. The weather gives him a welcome \u2013 and probably genuine \u2013 excuse for a continuing fall in clothing sales, and may help him keep his job a while longer. Bolland, who will provide a trading update on Thursday, is under pressure to improve performance after a disappointing Christmas and evidence that his overseas ambitions have stalled. Analysts are expecting sales of clothing and homewares in stores open more than a year to have fallen by 4.5% in the three months to March, even worse than the 3.8% revealed in January. Some of that is undoubtedly the result of the unseasonable chill compared with last year's balmy March. But M&amp;S's fashions have been getting a chilly reception from shoppers for some time and the chain is losing customers to rivals. Bolland is promising a revival in clothing from late summer, when we will begin to see the work of his crack new team, led by M&amp;S's own Mr Fix-it, John Dixon, and including former Debenhams boss Belinda Earl. M&amp;S's food business is holding up well, with analysts expecting a 3% lift in underlying sales. Food sales have benefited from shoppers' concerns about the horsemeat scandal, and that should buy Bolland some time. But how will long investors go on putting their concerns on ice? Sadly, M&amp;S's problems go well beyond knitwear styling. It is spending a fortune on attempts to modernise its distribution and IT systems. A leak of its grim Christmas trading figures fuelled rumours of disquiet within management, already unsettled by a spate of departures, and ventures in China and France are struggling. All this adds up to another year of falling profits. The lack of outrage when rumours of a bid from Qatar emerged a few weeks ago spoke volumes. Unfortunately, investors hoping that a white knight might ride out of the desert look set to be disappointed. The rumours have evaporated and it's all eyes on knitwear rather than knights to deliver value for M&amp;S shareholders.",

The 14 members of the board of BP will present themselves to an audience of shareholders large and small. This will mark the start of the annual general meeting season, which runs in to the early summer. At these meetings, major companies have to ask their shareholders to approve the election of directors, endorse the auditors who plough through the accounts and \u2013 the usual sticking point \u2013 give their backing to the pay awarded to top directors. After last year's \"shareholder spring\" \u2013 when a record number of companies had their pay polices voted down and three top bosses were thrown out of their jobs \u2013 the coming weeks will give an idea of how ready investors are to show their disapproval of big pay deals and underperforming directors this time around. Hot spots are already emerging \u2013 bonuses at Royal &amp; Sun Alliance in the year it cut its dividend are bound to be a flashpoint, as are the big bonuses paid to the bosses of energy giant Centrica \u2013 but whether these will translate into significant protest votes at annual meetings remains to be seen. One investor who will attend the BP annual meeting is Catherine Howarth, chief executive of Share Action \u2013 previously known as Fair Pensions \u2013 who was one of the stars of last year's shareholder spring. Then, her charity spoke up on behalf of small investors \u2013 not the big City institutions which own huge slugs of shares and whose influence is often wielded behind the scenes rather than at public meetings. Howarth intends to raise the issue of the pay of BP chief executive Bob Dudley, which was one of the inconsistencies she saw in last year's protests. She says: \"There was big dissent at WPP, where Martin Sorrell's pay package of up to 500% of variable pay [bonuses and other incentives as a percentage of basic salary] was rejected. What sailed through was Bob Dudley's 923% variable pay.\" She says that while there were some high-profile rows last year, the average level of dissent on pay was not very different from previous years, hitting just 7.6%, compared with 6.4% in 2011. Much of the extra noise was the result of the pressure investors felt they were under from business secretary Vince Cable, who at the time was consulting on new pay proposals, including the introduction of a binding vote. Currently protest votes are just that \u2013 companies and executives do not have to heed them. Cable was keeping up the pressure on investors this weekend, telling the Observer: \"At a time when the global economy remains fragile, it is neither sustainable, nor justifiable, to see directors' pay rising at around 10% a year while the performance of listed companies trails behind.\" The changes to remuneration policy \u2013 now watered down from the original proposal \u2013 do not come into force in time for this year's reporting season, but in October they will hand shareholders more power over new pay schemes and the ability to throw out existing arrangements after three years. \"The changes will help to create the right environment for long-term, responsible private sector growth, which will in turn support a stronger economy and a fairer society,\" says Cable. The TUC has formed a new group, Trade Union Share Owners, to co-ordinate voting on \u00a31bn of investments held by its own pension funds, and by those of its largest members, Unite and Unison. The National Employment Savings Trust, set up to look after the interests of those automatically enrolled into workplace pension schemes, is also expected to play a role at annual meetings. The TUC group intends to flex its muscles on issues including diversity in boardrooms as well as pay. However, Nicola Smith, the TUC's chief economist, says the job of cleaning up Britain's boardrooms shouldn't be left to shareholders alone: \"There's definitely a role for shareholders in holding companies to account, but we feel we need to move away from corporate governance that's focused solely on shareholder primacy: we have to be honest about the change in the composition of shareholders.\" She says that many investors these days might come from overseas, hold shares for the short term, or have interests that do not chime with the long-term needs of a company. One fund manager which does invest for the long term is Legal &amp; General, which owns around 4% of most FTSE 100 companies. It voted against 126 pay-related matters last year and has adopted this as a policy rather than abstention \u2013 the traditional way to show dissent. David Patt, L&amp;G's UK corporate governance analyst, says the impact of last year's revolts has been reflected in the 25% rise in meetings L&amp;G has held with companies to review their pay policies. Over the past year, 425 companies have consulted L&amp;G behind the scenes, compared with 342 the year before. But Patt says pay is not the only issue L&amp;G is monitoring. It is also keeping tabs on auditors and boardroom diversity, but is hoping this year's annual meeting season will be less explosive than last. \"If we see fewer remuneration reports voted down, we will see that as a success,\" he says.",

But be warned: a last refuge of the scoundrel will be to claim \"Look! It was all worthwhile. Thanks to our necessary and unavoidable policy of austerity, the economy is in better shape and is growing again.\" The chancellor and his supporters will gloss over the inconvenient truth that the economy was in fact growing again when they took over in May 2010 \u2013 goodness: was it less than three years ago? It seems more like a decade. It was not the troubles of the eurozone that derailed the recovery. It was the dramatic impact on business and consumer confidence of an austerity programme based on a misleading analogy \u2013 comparing our \"plight\" to that of Greece \u2013 and a false premise, namely that monetary policy would offset the impact of fiscal cutbacks. What monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates, quantitative easing and assorted gimmicks \u2013 has achieved is to prevent the degree of monetary contraction that aggravated the depression of 1929-31. Even so, such is the continuing state of the banking system that even an enlightened monetary response has severe limitations. There are moments in economic policy when governments make such obvious mistakes that even those of us who were taught always to see the alternative point of view wonder whether we are just \"seeing things\". The most egregious cases often concern changes in what is known as indirect taxation, of which the most conspicuous element is VAT. Thus a rightwing commentator recently praised the Thatcher government for having \"conquered\" inflation after inheriting a rate of 10% from Labour in 1979. What this revisionist omitted from the story was the way that, by almost doubling the rate of VAT for most transactions, the new government aggravated the problem. The conquest began a year later, by which time the year-on-year rate had peaked at 21.9%. And in Japan, in the mid-1990s, the government of the time put an abrupt stop to an economic recovery by almost doubling VAT. The big mistake the present British government made was again related to VAT: by restoring the rate to 20%, Osborne deflated the economy by close to 1% of gross domestic product, thereby taking it back into a recession whose length and consequences have justified the phrase \"prolonged depression\". So here we are, with a public mood of resignation to prolonged austerity, and a chancellor who hopes that with the reappearance of even an exiguous rate of economic growth he will have fooled people into accepting that it was somehow all worthwhile. The ultimate in defeatism is manifested by those who complain that the economy has not responded enough to the biggest devaluation since 1949. So what would your correspondent do? The first thing to establish would be that, although the trade and balance of payments figures are bad, there is no need for a devaluation: we have already had one of 25%. Because of the immediate effect on import prices, necessary devaluations tend to make the trading picture look even worse before it gets better \u2013 the J-curve effect. That is what has been happening. But, albeit slowly, there is evidence that the manufacturing and service sectors are finally waking up to the opportunities. Traditionally, in order to make a devaluation work, the government has to \"make room\" in the economy by depressing domestic demand. In present circumstances, however, there is no reason to do so. Our economy is so depressed, and operating so far below capacity and potential, that a major boost to domestic demand is necessary, and could be effected by a cut from 20% back to 17.5% in VAT. This would have a more immediate effect than the longer-term infrastructure projects currently proposed \u2013 which are also necessary and for which there is also plenty of room in our depressed economy. These can be financed very cheaply: indeed, in many cases they are investments that will pay for themselves in due course. The most important investment of all has to be in the sort of ambitious housing programme \u2013 no fewer than 300,000 new dwellings a year \u2013 that Harold Macmillan pulled off in the 1950s. It becomes increasingly obvious that the bill for housing benefit is the consequence of neglect of housebuilding by successive governments, starting with Thatcher's. We see the pernicious social effects in the way cuts in benefits and the \"bedroom tax\" are disrupting so many family lives. We need a secretary of state for housing (and nothing else) in the cabinet. Macmillan is reputedly one of the present prime minister's heroes. He should go for it!",

It was the dramatic impact on business and consumer confidence of an austerity programme based on a misleading analogy \u2013 comparing our \"plight\" to that of Greece \u2013 and a false premise, namely that monetary policy would offset the impact of fiscal&#xa0;cutbacks.</p> <p>What monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates, quantitative easing and assorted gimmicks \u2013 has achieved is to prevent the degree of monetary contraction that aggravated the depression of 1929-31. Even so, such is the continuing state of the banking system that even an enlightened monetary response has severe limitations.</p> <p>There are moments in economic policy when governments make such obvious mistakes that even those of us who were taught always to see the alternative point of view wonder whether we are just \"seeing things\".</p> <p>The most egregious cases often concern changes in what is known as indirect taxation, of which the most conspicuous element is VAT. Thus a rightwing commentator recently praised the Thatcher government for having \"conquered\" inflation after inheriting a rate of 10% from Labour in 1979.</p> <p>What this revisionist omitted from the story was the way that, by almost doubling the rate of VAT for most transactions, the new government aggravated the problem. The conquest began a year later, by which time the year-on-year rate had peaked at 21.9%.</p> <p>And in Japan, in the mid-1990s, the government of the time put an abrupt stop to an economic recovery by almost doubling VAT.</p> <p>The big mistake the present British government made was again related to VAT: by restoring the rate to 20%, Osborne deflated the economy by close to 1% of gross domestic product, thereby taking it back into a recession whose length and consequences have justified the phrase \"prolonged depression\".</p> <p>So here we are, with a public mood of resignation to prolonged austerity, and a chancellor who hopes that with the reappearance of even an exiguous rate of economic growth he will have fooled people into accepting that it was somehow all worthwhile. The ultimate in defeatism is manifested by those who complain that the economy has not responded enough to the biggest devaluation since 1949.</p> <p>So what would your correspondent do? The first thing to establish would be that, although the trade and balance of payments figures are bad, there is no need for a devaluation: we have already had one of 25%. Because of the immediate effect on import prices, necessary devaluations tend to make the trading picture look even worse before it gets better \u2013 the J-curve effect. That is what has been happening. But, albeit slowly, there is evidence that the manufacturing and service sectors are finally waking up to the opportunities.</p> <p>Traditionally, in order to make a devaluation work, the government has to \"make room\" in the economy by depressing domestic demand.</p> <p>In present circumstances, however, there is no reason to do so. Our economy is so depressed, and operating so far below capacity and potential, that a major boost to domestic demand is necessary, and could be effected by a cut from 20% back to 17.5% in VAT.</p> <p>This would have a more immediate effect than the longer-term infrastructure projects currently proposed \u2013 which are also necessary and for which there is also plenty of room in our depressed economy. These&#xa0;can be financed very cheaply: indeed, in many cases they are investments that will pay for themselves in due course.</p> <p>The most important investment of all has to be in the sort of ambitious housing programme \u2013 no fewer than 300,000 new dwellings a year \u2013 that Harold Macmillan pulled off in the&#xa0;1950s.</p> <p>It becomes increasingly obvious that the bill for housing benefit is the consequence of neglect of housebuilding by successive governments, starting with Thatcher's. We see the pernicious social effects in the way cuts in benefits and the \"bedroom tax\" are disrupting so many family lives.</p> <p>We need a secretary of state for housing (and nothing else) in the cabinet. Macmillan is reputedly one of the present prime minister's heroes. He should go for it!</p>",

Recently, the work and pensions minister, Iain Duncan Smith, said those on similar schemes were not unpaid as unemployed people receive upwards of \u00a356.25 a week. Unite, Britain's largest union, said the Homebase internal document had let \"the cat out of the bag,\" adding that the entire scheme smacked of \"state sponsored slavery.\" Separate from the Work Programme and mandatory work activity, the work experience scheme became voluntary last year after the government was forced by companies to change the rules. But jobseekers have told the Guardian they have been threatened with having their benefits sanctioned or sent on mandatory work activity if they did not take part or pulled out. Campaigning group Boycott Workfare said they were informed by an anonymous source that those in the Haringey branch had been warned they would be sanctioned if they did not take up the offer of the Homebase placements.
