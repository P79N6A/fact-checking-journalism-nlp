    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers are preparing to back the idea of extending the governance code for stock market-listed companies to large privately-owned businesses, in response to public anger at a string of scandals including the collapse of BHS. The proposal to extend the City\u2019s governance code to the private sphere was first put forward by the Financial Reporting Council, an independent body that regulates City behaviour, including adherence to corporate behaviour codes for public companies. The code for public companies was introduced in the 1990s in the wake of the Polly Peck scandal, when the business empire of disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir folded with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The code recommends that public companies are overseen by a board of directors, the majority of whom are independent from the company and its executives. Other aspects of the code are designed to ensure proper scrutiny of a company\u2019s executives and their pay, as well as to bolster accountability to shareholders. Ministers are expected to suggest the FRC also be invited to oversee governance rules for private firms, which could include well known companies such as JCB and Dyson as well as firms with large workforces that have been acquired by private equity funds, often using large amounts of borrowings. Theresa May is under pressure to prevent further scandals such as the failure of BHS, the retailer whose collapse has sparked criticism from MPs of its former owner, Sir Phillip Green. The green paper, from the department for business, energy and industrial strategy, is also expected to confirm the prime minister has lost her appetite for putting worker representatives on company boards \u2014 a pledge she made in the summer as part of her pitch to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis said: \u201cFollowing a disappointing autumn statement [on Wednesday], all the signs point towards these proposals lacking teeth. \u201cThe government have already ditched their flagship policy to put workers on boards. They try to sound radical, but this is a government whose warm words are closely followed by broken promises.\u201d Iain Wright, Labour MP for Hartlepool and chair of the business select committee, welcomed the idea of increased corporate governance for large private firms. \u201cThe BHS and Sports Direct committee inquiries highlighted weaknesses in corporate governance in both public and private companies,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting corporate governance right isn\u2019t a hindrance; it should be the starting point for supporting long-term success.\u201d He added that the committee looked forward to also questioning business secretary Greg Clark on other areas \u2014 including executive bonuses and boardroom diversity \u2014 when he appears before the MPs next month. Next week\u2019s green paper will see ministers first formal efforts to address the topic of executive pay at stock market-listed companies. According to a report on Sky News, it is expected to stop short of more radical measures such as imposing a firm cap on pay \u2014 as proposed recently by City investment group Hermes Investment Management. Instead, the green paper will reportedly suggest shareholders be given annual binding votes on the pay of company executives. Former business secretary Sir Vince Cable had introduced rules in 2013 requiring such a vote every three years. Earlier this year MPs on the business select committee began examining the idea of extending governance codes from public companies to large private firms. In a submission to the committee, the FRC suggested law makers consider \u201ca tailored code or guidance or regulated disclosure\u201d, but stress that this should \u201ctake into account the specific circumstances of large private companies, which are not uniform in their ownership arrangements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s digital expert has backed the \u00a31.4bn sale of Skyscanner to a Chinese company and argued the deal does not embarrass the chancellor\u2019s efforts to maintain the independence of UK technology companies. Eileen Burbidge, who chairs the government\u2019s Tech City UK initiative, which fosters the development of tech companies, said the sale of Skyscanner demonstrated the quality of the British tech scene. She said the Edinburgh-based company had grown to a size where a sale was one of a number of options for it to keep expanding. \u201cIt demonstrates how much talent there is in Britain that companies from China, the US or anywhere are looking to buy businesses here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Skyscanner is the kind of company the chancellor was referring to. It\u2019s certainly not a start-up. It\u2019s already very successfully scaled.\u201d In his autumn statement on Wednesday, Philip Hammond pledged to invest an extra \u00a3400m in venture capital funds to provide more finance for growing companies. Hammond said the funding, through the British Business Bank, was \u201ca first step to tackle the longstanding problem of our fastest-growing technology firms being snapped up by bigger companies, rather than growing to scale\u201d. Yet, that night, it was announced Skyscanner, a flight-booking website, had been sold to Ctrip, a Chinese tourism group. The company is one of Britain\u2019s so-called unicorn businesses \u2013 privately owned companies with valuations of $1bn (\u00a3800m) or more. The sale raised fresh questions about foreign takeovers of British companies \u2013 particularly those that lead in technology \u2013 after the acquisition of ARM Holdings by SoftBank of Japan in August. It also raised doubts about British tech companies\u2019 ability to emulate the success of Silicon Valley in the US, where the Snapchat app is preparing to float with a value of up to $25bn (\u00a320bn). Burbidge said a stock market listing was just one option open to privately owned tech companies and that a sale to a competitor, or bringing in more private investment, could supply further funding without the added scrutiny that comes with being a public company. She said Skyscanner\u2019s value and expertise would be recycled into the UK tech scene. Its biggest investor, Scottish Equity Partners, has come out with \u00a3465m from the \u00a39m stake it bought in 2007. Skyscanner\u2019s founders have backed Decidz, an app business based in Edinburgh, that lets people organise events together. Burbidge said: \u201cI would like to get to the point where British companies are buying their international counterparts but in the meantime it\u2019s good that international companies are looking to the UK.\u201d Skyscanner started in 2001 when its co-founder, Gareth Williams, was working as a computer programmer and was frustrated when trying to compare flight prices for a skiing holiday. Now the business helps 60 million customers compare data on hotels, flights and car hire. Williams, who is Skyscanner\u2019s chief executive, said the company could have kept growing at a good pace but that joining up with Ctrip will transform its prospects and give it the backing to expand in China. He said: \u201cThe support of Ctrip will allow Skyscanner significant expansion in our reach and product globally, as we\u2019ll gain insights and product investments from them. Ctrip has a huge market share in China and aims to grow significantly in the rest of the world. We can help make this aim a reality.\u201d He said Ctrip agreed Skyscanner should operate independently under its existing management and keep its headquarters in Edinburgh. Skyscanner has been rumoured to be considering a stock market flotation for several years, following other former unicorns such as Zoopla, the property website, and Sophos, the cyber-security company.",

The company is one of Britain\u2019s so-called unicorn businesses \u2013 privately owned companies with valuations of $1bn (\u00a3800m) or more.</p> <p>The sale raised fresh questions about foreign takeovers of British companies \u2013 particularly those that lead in technology \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/arm-shareholders-softbank-takeover-tech-lord-myners\">after the acquisition of ARM Holdings by SoftBank of Japan in August</a>. It also raised doubts about British tech companies\u2019 ability to emulate the success of Silicon Valley in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/snapchat-ipo-video-app-worth\">where the Snapchat app is preparing to float with a value of up to $25bn</a> (\u00a320bn).</p> <p>Burbidge said a stock market listing was just one option open to privately owned tech companies and that a sale to a competitor, or bringing in more private investment, could supply further funding without the added scrutiny that comes with being a public company.</p> <p>She said Skyscanner\u2019s value and expertise would be recycled into the UK tech scene. Its biggest investor, Scottish Equity Partners, has come out with \u00a3465m from the \u00a39m stake it bought in 2007. Skyscanner\u2019s founders have backed Decidz, an app business based in Edinburgh, that lets people organise events together.</p> <p>Burbidge said: \u201cI would like to get to the point where British companies are buying their international counterparts but in the meantime it\u2019s good that international companies are looking to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Skyscanner started in 2001 when its co-founder, Gareth Williams, was working as a computer programmer and was frustrated when trying to compare flight prices for a skiing holiday. Now the business helps 60 million customers compare data on hotels, flights and car hire.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Williams, who is Skyscanner\u2019s chief executive, said the company could have kept growing at a good pace but that joining up with Ctrip will transform its prospects and give it the backing to expand in China.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe support of Ctrip will allow Skyscanner significant expansion in our reach and product globally, as we\u2019ll gain insights and product investments from them. Ctrip has a huge market share in China and aims to grow significantly in the rest of the world. We can help make this aim a reality.\u201d</p> <p>He said Ctrip agreed Skyscanner should operate independently under its existing management and keep its headquarters in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Skyscanner has been rumoured to be considering a stock market flotation for several years, following other former unicorns such as Zoopla, the property website, and Sophos, the cyber-security company.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Retailers have rung up another record Black Friday, but high streets remained calm as shoppers opted to hunt for bargains on mobile phones and computers. The association for online retailers, IMRG, estimated that \u00a31.27bn was spent on Friday, up 16% on last year. It will be the busiest day in a week of promotions expected to deliver online retail sales of \u00a36.77bn in the seven days to Monday 28 November. In the six years since Black Friday first arrived in the UK, the action has shifted away from high street stores. Widely reported scuffles in stores in 2014 and the increasing ease of scanning for the best deals via the internet have encouraged bargain hunters to shop on the web. Tesco opened hundreds of its largest stores at 5am and put on extra security guards and crowd barriers. Sainsbury\u2019s, Debenhams, John Lewis and Currys PC World also opened stores early, but there were few queues. At Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London, there were only 11 people in the queue when the supermarket opened at 5am \u2013 barely outnumbering the security guards. Some of those queuing had been there since 4.30am and were surprised how few people had turned up compared with last year. One shopper, who bought two TVs, said: \u201cThis is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u2019s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d The supermarket\u2019s top selling items included HD TVs, FIFA 17 video games, iPad minis and Google Chromecast devices. Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay, north London, was equally quiet and it was about 5.50am before even a small queue gathered outside. One shopper said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to come out because of the fighting. They are doing it all online.\u201d John Lewis, which racked up the biggest sales week in its 150-year history around Black Friday last year, said overnight sales through its website were ahead of expectations with five orders placed every second. The department store joined a wave of major retailers reporting double digit surges in online sales from midnight through to lunchtime. The Argos chief executive, John Rogers, said there had been 500,000 visits to its website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm \u2013 up 50% on last year. The company said 80% of its online sales came via mobile phones and its top sellers included iPads, games consoles, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. Currys PC World said more than 500,000 shoppers had visited its website before 6am with orders up 40% on 2015. Over the day it racked up 13% more visits than last year as shoppers snapped up 241% more fitness monitors and 60% more drones. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at advisory firm KPMG said: \u201cThis has been a pretty big event for the online channel, but in the physical environment it seems to have run out of steam.\u201d Digital agency Salmon said that between midnight and 9am 75% of shopper traffic came via mobile devices and 57% over the day as a whole. It also flagged a spike in the number of overseas shoppers as the weaker pound enhanced the deals on offer in euro or dollar terms. Nationwide said its shoppers carried out over 2.4m transactions between midnight and 17.30, 31% more than on a normal Friday and 13% up on last Black Friday. Its account holders spent over \u00a3115m, up 38% on a normal Friday.",

    "webTitle": "Black Friday shoppers rush for online bargains  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Black Friday sales continue across the UK, we\u2019re going to close up for the day. We haven\u2019t had the unseemly shop-floor scenes of 2014, as people scrapped to get their hands on the best deals. Guardian reporters hit the shops early this morning to find much calmer scenes, and small or no queues. However, retailers are reporting a big surge in online sales, as people shop on their mobile phones to get the best deals. Andy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, explains: It\u2019s no surprise that we didn\u2019t have people queuing to get into stores like in previous years. This is partly because more retailers opted to spread out their deals over a longer period, but it\u2019s also because of the growth of online and mobile shopping. Black Friday has still captured the attention of shoppers this year and it seems the appetite for a bargain is still there \u2013 but how consumers shop for those bargains is changing. People don\u2019t have to wait until the stores open. Instead, they can search for deals at home or on their way to work \u2013 and the online trading figures for the early hours of Black Friday seem to show this was the case more than ever this year. The lack of crowds reminded one reader of the launch of the iPhone 7 at Apple\u2019s Viborg store in Denmark: That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend. AM appliancesdirect.co.uk says customers are taking advantage of Black Friday to make savings on big ticket items. Since midnight it has sold more than 4,000 blenders, over 2,000 washing machines, and 1,000 4K HD televisions. Mark Kelly, marketing manager, says demand has been strong as consumers want to buy big ticket items now before consumer prices start to pick up next year: We anticipated strong sales, but the popularity in cut price home appliances this year has surpassed our expectations. Shoppers have taken full advantage of thousands of pounds of savings on big ticket items in anticipation of price rises in technology early next year as a result of the exchange rate changes following the referendum result. Amazon reported brisk online sales as a result of its latest deals, as part of its extended Black Friday sale which started on 14 November and with new offers launched every day since. The top deals running today include discounts on bestselling Alexa \u2018hands-free\u2019 devices Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, with Echo available for just \u00a3119.99, and Echo Dot available for just \u00a339.99. Doug Gurr, Amazon\u2019s UK country manager, commented: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very positive customer response to the thousands of deals during our extended 12 day Black Friday Sale and customers have been snapping up lots of our great deals on offer since midnight. From the company\u2019s Peterborough distribution warehouse Paul Firth, Amazon\u2019s head of music, said health and beauty products and toys were also doing well. Three of the top five best-selling items in its sports section were Fitbit Flex activity trackers (up to 50% off) while electric tootbrushes (up to 76% off) accounted for three of the top five beauty items. Star Wars toys and games were also snapped up, alongside the Disney Rapunzel doll with glowing hair. Like other retailers Amazon has completely sold out of this year\u2019s must-have toy, Hatchimals. \u201cPeople are also buying practical and essential things such as PC memory cards and wi-fi extenders\u201d Firth said. Last year in the UK Amazon sold 7.4 million items on Black Friday - 86 items every second. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what the picture is\u201d Firth added. \u201cBut it certainly all looks very busy. Busy, but ordered\u2026.\u201d At Peterborough, the 1,000 staff had been bolstered by another 2,000 to ensure no hitches with picking and packing during this key trading period. Football clubs are embracing Black Friday, with many offering 20% off kit and other merchandise in their shops and online. Leicester City, reigning Premier League champions, have got their own twist: Some more Black Friday stats, this time from Very.co.uk: 15 consoles sold every minute A smartwatch sold every 12 seconds 21 bottles of perfume every minute A set of curling tongs sold every 8 seconds Currys PC World says it had more than half a million visitors to its website before 6am. The two most popular products have been the Google Chromecast and the JVC 32C660 32\u201d Smart LED TV. Stuart Ramage, e-commerce director at Dixons Carphone: We\u2019ve been preparing for today for almost a year now to ensure the best deals for our customers. We continue to break records with orders already up 40% year-on-year since 2015, and as we predicted, shoppers are making the most of our stores being open early, but also placing orders by mobile devices with our highest ever mobile traffic share since Black Friday began. Argos says its busiest hour so far was between 8am and 9am, when it received about 700,000 web visits (80% of which were on mobiles and tablets). Popular products include iPads, PS4, xbox, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. It also expects TVs and toys to among the best sellers. Lunchtime is expected to mark another peak, and then 5pm to 7pm as people make their way home from work. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at retail marketing agency, Savvy, is at the Argos distribution centre in Barton. I\u2019ve been here since 5.30am where there\u2019s a sense of great calm and slick organisation despite this being the biggest and busiest day of the year for Argos. With 800-plus staff on site during this peak week they\u2019re expecting to pick over two million items and over 330,000 today. With business operating 24/7 the Barton distribution centre will process 15,000 parcels an hour alone. Not all retailers are slashing prices today, with some taking a different approach to the US-inspired discount day. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler reports: Outdoor brands Patagonia and Braintree, as well as fashion chain FatFace, will be donating proceeds from the day to charity while Jigsaw and Next have both announced they will not be offering discounts. Meanwhile Berghaus is encouraging its customers to head outdoors as an alternative to the shopping frenzy. Patagonia will be donating its entire global sales income from its own website and stores on 25 November to 80 grassroots environmental organisations around the world, including Surfers against Sewage and London Waterkeeper in the UK. \u201cAs people think generously about family and friends, we also want to help our customers show love to the planet, which badly needs a gift or two,\u201d the company said. Full story here: It may be Black Friday but for some, it\u2019s all about Giving Tuesday. Giving Tuesday (this year on 29 November) began five years ago in the US as an antidote to the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) brought it to the UK for the first time 2014, and is today calling on Black Friday shoppers to support a cause they care about next Tuesday. Hannah Terrey, head of policy and campaigns at CAF, says: After the frenzy of festive consumerism, #givingtuesday is a day for everyone to \u2018do good stuff\u2019 for a cause they care about, whether that\u2019s donating money, volunteering time or simply talking about their favourite charities. Just like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, #givingtuesday has now firmly established itself as a regular fixture in the festive calendar. It is great to see that even more people are planning to take some time over Christmas to give something back to a good cause. Shoppers heading into Poundland expecting some Black Friday bargains for less than \u00a31 are in for a shock. Poundland\u2019s surprises include - for the first time - a range of products with price tags exceeding the standard \u00a31. The discount retailer says it is the \u201cperfect destination to snap up a bargain this Black Friday\u201d, which include up to 65% on perfumes and fragrances, including a 50 ml bottle of Eau de Gaga which can be snapped up for just \u00a38, compared with the RRP of \u00a332. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the positive survey from the CBI suggests the economy is holding up in the fourth quarter, following growth of 0.5% in the third. He does, however, add a note of caution: A buoyant November CBI Distributive Trades survey points to consumers still splashing out in the fourth quarter, thereby boosting hopes that GDP growth will hold up well. Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers\u2019 willingness to spend holds up over the vital Christmas shopping period. The major problem facing the economy \u2013 and retailers in particular - is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will progressively weaken over the coming months with inflation rising markedly due to the weakened pound and companies likely increasingly looking to hold down pay to limit their total costs. The labour market also looks likely to come under mounting pressure despite its current resilience. In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are likely to rise appreciably over the coming months. Retail sales picked up pace in November and were stronger than expected according to the CBI\u2019s latest snapshot. Volumes increased at the fastest rate in more than a year in the 12 months to November, driven higher by sales of items including clothing, hardware and DIY. The distributive trades survey found that 42% of retailers reported a rise in sales compared with a year ago, while 16% said they were down. The resulting balance of +26% was the strongest since September 2015, and far stronger than the +26% forecast by City economists. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said November was a \u201cbuoyant\u201d month for sales. With the later onset of cold weather, shoppers stocking up their winter wardrobe has helped to boost high street sales. While we expect to see decent growth in the near term, retailers are keeping a close eye on price rises coming down the track and the impact on consumer spending.\u201d John Lewis says it has seen strong demand from shoppers so far today. The busiest period was between 8am and 8.30am, as people shopped on their way into work. The department store chain is taking five orders every second online. There was a particular spike in transactions completed on mobile phones, up 21% between 8am and 9am. Best-selling products: The Sonos Play 1 is the biggest technology seller, selling one every ten seconds The Lego Simpsons house is the top seller by value Marc Jacobs perfume is the strongest seller by number Sophie Conran crockery is the best seller in John Lewis\u2019s home department Home Dino Rocos, lead director and operations director at John Lewis, said online sales had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d. Back to Black Friday. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, comments on how the event is changing: Black Friday in its original form \u2013 the manic one-day, in-store shopping experience \u2013 has already changed significantly over the past three years. We\u2019re seeing the continuation of that evolution in 2016 with retailers extending their sales either side of Black Friday, and the term \u2018Black Fiveday\u2019 becoming more commonplace, as well as a continuation of the trend towards online. Little movement in Europe\u2019s major markets this morning. With thin trading expected in the US following Thanksgiving, investors elsewhere appear to be taking a bit of a breather: FTSE 100: flat at 6,831 Germany\u2019s DAX: flat at 10,690 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,547 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 8,646 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 16,531 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 342 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: With US markets likely to be in a thin post-Thanksgiving mood there appears to be little in the way of positive drivers for European markets this morning. This lack of interest has seen markets in Europe trading listlessly, weighed down on the one hand by weakness in the banking sector and a decline in oil prices ahead of next week\u2019s OPEC meeting in Vienna. James Knightley, senior UK economist at ING, says the second half of 2016 should prove rosy overall, but come 2017 the economy is likely to take a turn for the worse. This is a firm growth story that again shows the economy has weathered the Brexit storm very well so far. The data flow so far suggests that the fourth quarter should also post a decent growth rate, but we still expect a substantial slowdown in 2017. Our main concern relates to a squeeze on household spending power brought about by a sharp pick-up in inflation that isn\u2019t matched by wage increases. We also expect a slowdown in hiring and investment by businesses as Brexit uncertainty kicks in and the political pressure rises once Article 50 is triggered. Here is a breakdown of how different parts of the economy performed in the third quarter, compared with the second. It grew by 0.5% overall (and 2.3% annually). Services sector output: +0.8% Industrial production: -0.5% Construction output: -1.1% Household spending: +0.7% Business investment: +0.9% Government spending: +0.4% Exports: +0.7% Imports: -1.5% The ONS has said there is no clear evidence yet to suggest the Brexit vote has had an impact on the economy. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, has commented on this morning\u2019s second estimate of growth. He makes the point that although business investment grew in Q3, most of those spending decisions will have been taken before the referendum, when the UK was expected to vote to remain in the EU: Investment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it\u2019s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. That, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.\u201d The Office for National Statistics has just published its second estimate of third-quarter growth, confirming a 0.5% increase in GDP. Business investment grew more than expected, by 0.9% over the quarter compared with expectations of 0.6%. It was a slight dip compared with business investment growth of 1% in the second quarter. More soon. Black Friday is also a thing in Brazil apparently. Photo evidence from S\u00e3o Paulo: In other news, we have a couple of bits of interesting data coming up in the UK this morning. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish its second estimate of GDP in the third quarter. It is expected to confirm that the economy grew 0.5% between July and September, unchanged from the first estimate. The ONS is also expected to confirm an annual rate of growth of 2.3% in the third quarter. The second estimate will reveal new data on the spending side of the economy, and will offer a glimpse on firms\u2019 willingness to spend in the months following the June Brexit vote. Business investment is expected to rise by 0.6% in the third quarter. At 11am the CBI will release its distributive trades survey for November. It is expected to show a slowdown in retail sales growth compared with October. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, gives his view on Black Friday: Well, it remains to be seen how busy the high street will be today, but the much-dreaded \u201cBlack Friday\u201d sale promotions this week will undoubtedly pull a lot of business forward from December, at lower margins, and it\u2019s tempting to agree with the comment to the BBC by Peter Ruis, the boss of fashion chain Jigsaw, that Black Friday is a \u201ccomplete and utter deception\u201d\u2026 Here\u2019s our latest news story: Retailers have shifted their approach to Black Friday since it arrived here in 2010 (thanks to Amazon). This year many BF discounts are not single-day offers but promotions that spread over days and weeks, with a bigger focus online. PCA Predict says there have been record breaking online transactions this morning, up 21% on last year between midnight and 7am. East London is home to the savviest shoppers, with the highest number of online transactions before breakfast, followed by Croydon and Birmingham. Mobiles have been the most popular device for deal-hunters so far but PCA Predict expect this could change to desktops over the day as consumers head into work. The top five busiest online shopping regions according to PCA: East London Croydon Birmingham Leicester Rotherham Back here in 2016, Black Friday appears to have moved online: My colleague Rupert Neate captured some of the madness of 2014 in this short video. Well worth a watch: Black Friday today is a far cry from the scenes we saw in stores in 2014, when there was an unseemly scramble for bargains such as televisions. Here\u2019s a reminder from two years ago: Guardian reporters have been out and about since the early hours, joining the Black Friday bargain hunters. My colleague Sarah Butler says its been \u201cmore of a saunter than a scramble\u201d at Tesco Extra in Streatham: While online retailers were busy, stores were off to a slow start. At the Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London, there were only 11 people in the queue when the supermarket opened at 5am - not many more than the number of security guards. Some of those queuing had been there since 4.30am and were surprised how few people had turned up compared to last year. Tony was queuing up for a Hatchimal after being unable to get one for his kids online. \u201cI\u2019ll either go home a hero of If they haven\u2019t got one I\u2019ll be home in bed in half an hour.\u201d Most of those in the queue were planning to pick up a TV from the large pile just inside the door. But it was more of a saunter than a scramble once the doors opened. Michael, who bought two TVs, said: \u201cThis is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u2019s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke. Martin, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon. He said hundreds more TVs would be delivered over the weekend. \u201cIt will give us additional spend later on when people come in to do their normal shop,\u201d he said. John Rogers, the new chief executive officer of Argos, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that there had been 500,000 visits to the retailer\u2019s website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm - up 50% on last year. He expects peak traffic between 7am and 10am as people shop on their mobile phones on their way to work. Rogers - the former finance director at Sainsbury\u2019s which has taken over the business - was speaking from Argos\u2019s distribution warehouse in Burton-on-Trent, as part of a whistlestop \u2018national tour\u2019 of its stores and facilities in the run-up to Christmas. For Black Friday itself, Argos has set up three \u201cwar rooms\u201d. One will monitor and tweak deals, one will oversee systems \u2013 standing ready to tackle any technical glitches - and the third will oversee communications with shoppers. Rogers predicts that Argos will take 70% or more of its orders online on that day, compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company is better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Black Friday is here again, but this time without the shop-floor stampedes. Retailers are instead reporting a surge in online traffic as shoppers seek out the best bargains at the discount event that began in the US but has been adopted by the UK in recent years. Argos said there were half a million visitors to its website in the first hour of Black Friday trading. So far we haven\u2019t seen the queues and chaos in shops that characterised Black Friday in 2014. It\u2019s much more orderly this year. We will be bringing you updates on this, and other developments, as they happen.",

I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke.</p> <p>Martin, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon.

John Lewis said overnight sales through its website were ahead of expectations as shoppers placed five orders every second. The most soughtafter items included Sonos Play 1 wireless speakers, with one sold every 10 seconds, and Marc Jacobs perfume, it said. \u201cSales on johnlewis.com exceeded expectations overnight,\u201d said Dino Rocos, operations director at John Lewis, who added: \u201cWe have carefully planned for this year\u2019s Black Friday event to ensure orders can be fulfilled without compromising customer service.\u201d In the six years since Black Friday arrived in the UK the action has shifted from high street stores to become a predominantly online event. The association for online retailers, IMRG, thinks \u00a31.27bn will be spent online today, up 16% on last year. It will be the busiest day in a week of promotions that is expected to deliver online retail sales of \u00a36.77bn in the seven days to Monday 28 November. According to Nationwide its customers spent \u00a333.9m between midnight and 10am, up 57% on a normal Friday. More than 630,353 transactions were completed during this period, it said, a 40% increase on Black Friday last year. John Lewis said that is busiest period to date had been between 8am and 8.30am as people shopped on their way to work. Sales through mobile phones were up by more than fifth between 8am and 9am, it said. Argos chief executive John Rogers said there had been 500,000 visits to its website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm \u2013 up 50% on last year. The company said its top sellers included iPads, games consoles, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. Rogers said the company was better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems, but there were reports of outages during that busy first hour. Last year the websites of several major retailers, including Argos, crashed due to the volume traffic, and in the early hours of today shoppers reported glitches on the Currys PC World and Tesco sites. Sebastian James, chief executive of Currys PC World owner Dixons Carphone, said: \u201cUK stores and online very busy so far. Our deals are the strongest ever.\u201d Although stores such as Currys PC World, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco opened their doors early, turnout around the country appeared low as stores \u2013 many of which had been running deals for several days \u2013 struggled to compete with the welter of online deals. Currys PC World said more than 500,000 shoppers had visited its website before 6am with orders, up 40% on 2015. Diane Wehrle, an analyst at Springboard which tracks shopper numbers, said she expected fewer people to visit high streets and shopping centres on Friday, despite the lure of discounts, with footfall down 7% and 5% respectively on last year. \u201cThough shopping centres in general have performed less well than the high street this year, they tend to fare better on Black Friday due to having multiple retailers all under one roof which offer larger discounts,\u201d she said. One area that is expected to buck the trend is London\u2019s West End. Steven Medway, operations director at New West End Company, said it expected stores in the area to ring up sales of \u00a3115.5m on Friday, up 5% on last year, as tourists flock to the area. \u201cWe are seeing more international visitors coming into the West End to shop with the pound being lower,\u201d said Medway. \u201cBased on footfall and sales data we [the West End] have been outperforming the rest of the UK since the Brexit vote in June. \u201cThe queues are less obvious, because the discounts run over the weekend. As a result you don\u2019t see the panic buying of the early years [of Black Friday],\u201d added Medway.",

      "bodyText": "Tata is preparing to commit to its UK steel operations, including the vast Port Talbot works, for at least the next 10 years, in a move which would secure the future of more than 11,000 steel workers and deliver a major boost to the government. Lord Bhattacharyya, one of the group\u2019s closest advisers, said Tata is preparing \u201cmajor announcements about growth in Tata Steel\u201d, and is \u201cresolving\u201d the problems facing the business. He also said the company is halting the sale of its speciality steels arm, which is part of Tata Steel UK and employs about 2,000 people in northern England. Bhattacharyya is close to Ratan Tata, the chairman of Tata Group, and advised him on the purchase of Corus, which was previously British Steel, and Jaguar Land Rover almost a decade ago. He is the founder and chairman of Warwick Manufacturing Group, a research partnership between the University of Warwick and leading manufacturers. He is also a member of the panel that will choose Tata\u2019s successor as group chairman. The future of Tata Steel UK and its 11,000 workers has been in doubt since the Indian company announced a review of the business in March, amid mounting losses and heavy debts. The entire UK business was initially put up for sale before Tata Steel pulled out of talks to focus on a merger of its European operations, including the UK business, with the German group ThyssenKrupp. Talks with ThyssenKrupp have been continuing, but Tata sources say the company is now willing to commit to its UK sites whether this deal goes ahead or not. Bhattacharyya was talking at a meeting of political and automotive leaders from the Midlands on Thursday evening, which included Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary. The government has been fiercely criticised for not doing enough to help the steel industry, which has struggled due to mounting energy costs and China dumping cheap steel in Europe, which has driven down prices. The Labour peer said: \u201cOf course we went through some problems as you have read in the press in the last few months but we are now resolving it and we are working with everybody, with the workers, local authorities and government, in order to make sure that Tata produces steel here for the next 10 years at least. We will do that.\u201d Bhattacharyya claimed Britain \u201chas got a lot of skill in steel\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have been going through some problems of course, temporary problems, but nevertheless I think we are on the verge of solving it. We will work with Jaguar Land Rover to introduce thin steels for the new generation of cars.\u201d The future of Tata Steel UK\u2019s pension scheme, the British Steel pension scheme, has been a major obstacle to the future of the business. It has liabilities of more than \u00a315bn and 130,000 members, making it one of the biggest retirement schemes in the country. The company has been in talks with the government about spinning the pension scheme off into a new vehicle disconnected from Tata Steel, which could prove hugely controversial if it is finalised.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, has said making Britain a world-leading hub for next-generation electric vehicles will be at the heart of the government\u2019s new industrial strategy, providing one of the clearest indications yet of the sectors it wants to focus on in a post-Brexit economy. Clark said the automotive sector, particularly electric vehicles, driverless cars and battery storage, will be a \u201cemblematic area of focus\u201d and is going to be \u201cone of the big features of the world and Britain\u2019s industrial policy during the weeks, months and years ahead\u201d. The government is expected to lay out an outline of its industrial strategy in the next few weeks, with Clark saying it will publish \u201csome directions that we want to work together [with businesses] to elaborate further\u201d. The senior cabinet minister was talking at a meeting of political and automotive leaders from the Midlands on Thursday evening at the University of Warwick. At the event, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said his company is aiming to double its global workforce of 40,000 as it expands into electric cars and battery technology. This ambition would see the creation of 10,000 new jobs in the UK over the next few years as JLR continues its dramatic recovery since the financial crisis by opening new research and development sites. Speth said that JLR wants to build a new electric car plant in Britain, as well as a factory that can produce batteries, but that the carmaker needs support from the government. \u201cWe want to build our EVs (electric vehicles) in the west Midlands, in the home of our design and engineering,\u201d Speth said. \u201cThis is clear, it goes without saying. But there is a huge problem \u2013 we don\u2019t currently have the capacity to produce them at scale nor at speed, the costs of doing business in the UK are high compared to other countries, and alongside the access to the right skills, energy infrastructure remains the single greatest challenge to Jaguar Land Rover.\u201d Speth said JLR needs the equivalent of four power stations and the \u201cright legislative framework\u201d to develop its electric car plans, and for the fledgling industry to flourish in the UK. The company unveiled its first electric car, the I-Pace, earlier this month in Los Angeles. The JLR boss warned Britain will lose investment to other countries, such as Germany, if the government did not act. \u201cThis is a race ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s really a race and either we win or we lose. The government must be the enabler,\u201d he said. \u201cOur opportunity is nothing less then to lead the world in smart cities, smart economy and smart mobility.\u201d In response, Clark said: \u201cThis is a sector \u2013 and particularly the electric vehicles, connected autonomous vehicles, battery storage \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be a more emblematic area of focus that the industrial strategy will back and enable. \u201cThis is going to be one of the big features of the world and Britain\u2019s industrial policy during the weeks, months and years ahead. \u201cThe pace of this is quickening all the time and so is our commitment to it. This is a big moment, for a hugely important combination of sectors technologies and institutions. \u201cYou can count completely not just on my commitment but my involvement in progressing these discussions to turn them into actions.\u201d Clark also described how the creation of an industrial strategy will influence government policies. He said: \u201cWhat does it mean? It means if you have an industrial strategy there is no such as a short-term strategy, it is a contradiction in terms. So it is a explicit commitment to act in terms of policies and creating institutions for the long term rather than the short. A commitment to have a industrial strategy is to act for the long term. \u201cIt can\u2019t be something that the government announces to an unsuspecting world, it has to be done together. It is certainly not a laissez-faire strategy, it is not \u2018over to you\u2019, this is a partnership, and that is the strategic intent.\u201d Clark\u2019s comments were welcomed by local authority leaders. Jonathan Browning, chairman of the Coventry and Warwicksire LEP, said: \u201cThe industrial strategy is in its early days but it is pleasing to see that government recognises not only the importance of the advanced manufacturing sector but also the need for us to be at the forefront of developing the automotive technologies of the future. \u201cJaguar Land Rover will be leading that vanguard and has spelled out its ambitions to produce electric cars, along with the growth and investment that will bring both directly and to the regional supply chain.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK may be ringing up its biggest Black Friday yet, but a growing band of retailers are putting a different spin on the US-inspired discount day. Outdoor brands Patagonia and Braintree, as well as fashion chain Fat Face, will be donating proceeds from the day to charity while Jigsaw and Next have both announced they will not be offering discounts. Meanwhile Berghaus is encouraging its customers to head outdoors as an alternative to the shopping frenzy. Patagonia will be donating its entire global sales income from its own website and stores on 25 November to 80 grassroots environmental organisations around the world, including Surfers against Sewage and London Waterkeeper in the UK. \u201cAs people think generously about family and friends, we also want to help our customers show love to the planet, which badly needs a gift or two,\u201d the company said. Patagonia funds environmental groups by handing over 1% of its sales. It added: \u201cDuring a difficult and divisive time, we felt it was important to go further and connect more of our customers, who love wild places, with those who are fighting tirelessly to protect them.\u201d Braintree will be donating half of sales via its website on Black Friday to the refugee council and a second charity to be voted on by shoppers. John Snare, founder of the brand which was set up in Australia and is now based in London, said: \u201cBlack Friday doesn\u2019t sit well with us as a business but it\u2019s impossible to ignore. This is our way of participating without compromising our values and is a very good opportunity to support some important causes.\u201d For the second year in a row, Fat Face will run its Thanks for Giving campaign in which it donates 10% of net profits over the Black Friday weekend to charities local to its stores. Last year the company handed out just under \u00a3200,000. This year the company has already committed to donating at least \u00a3100,000 and says it is determined to raise more than last year. \u201cFat Face believes passionately that the retail industry can act as a force for good,\u201d the company said. Berghaus is taking a completely different approach to the weekend. The outdoor brand is offering 1,000 prizes that can only be claimed by solving a series of clues and visiting locations around the UK \u2013 the Get Out Game. Richard Leedham, the Berghaus brand president, said: \u201cRather than indulge in the discount shopping mayhem, we think that a healthier alternative \u2013 for body and soul \u2013 is to explore the outdoors. We appreciate that some people might need an incentive to do that, which is where the Get Out Game comes in.\u201d Jigsaw said it would not be participating in Black Friday this year after research indicated increasing cynicism about the promotional day among shoppers. Peter Ruis, chief executive of the Jigsaw Group, said: \u201cBlack Friday warps our perception of what\u2019s valuable and important. Has that product being offered at 20% off been designed to offset the price decrease? Has the supplier had pressure put on them to take the hit? Was it always meant to be at that price anyway and been \u2018price established\u2019 higher?\u201d \u201cWe buy products for their quality and craft, and quite simply because we love them.

    "webTitle": "GDP growth confirmed in three months after Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British businesses continued to invest and consumers carried on spending in the months following the Brexit vote, defying predictions that a wave of uncertainty would hit economic activity. In the first official estimate of how firms\u2019 spending fared after the referendum, the Office for National Statistics said business investment rose 0.9% in the July-to-September quarter. That was only a small slowdown from 1% growth in the previous quarter and beat forecasts for 0.6% growth in a Reuters poll of economists. The figures echoed business surveys suggesting companies have shrugged off the shock of the referendum result for now. The ONS confirmed its earlier estimate that GDP expanded 0.5% in the third quarter, only a small slowdown from 0.7% growth in the second quarter and stronger than most economists had predicted in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. But there were warnings the brunt of the Brexit vote would be felt next year as the weak pound stokes inflation and as negotiations over leaving the EU begin. Providing more details of the third quarter in Friday\u2019s update, statisticians said consumer spending continued to be the main driver of economic growth, fuelled by rising household incomes. There was also a contribution to growth from net trade \u2013 the difference between what the UK exports and imports. That came as imports fell but exports grew, probably helped by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which makes UK goods more competitive in overseas markets. But the data also confirmed earlier estimates showing that the construction sector had fallen into a technical recession, contracting for two straight quarters, while output was down for manufacturers and the wider industrial sector. The ONS said that since the referendum in June, GDP growth had been in line with recent trends, suggesting \u201climited effect so far\u201d from the referendum. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS said: \u201cInvestment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it\u2019s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. \u201cThat, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.\u201d Economists were quick to warn the recent pace of growth would be hard to sustain. The government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, predict growth will slow to 1.4% in 2017 from 2.1% this year as business investment slows and as incomes are squeezed by higher living costs. Inflation is expected to pick up because the weaker pound makes imports to the UK more expensive. The data company IHS Markit said its surveys pointed to the firms\u2019 and households\u2019 resilience continuing into the final quarter of this year. But it too was cautious about the year ahead. \u201cFor the moment, the data suggest that the economy has exhibited greater than anticipated resilience in the face of headwinds such as Brexit worries and rising prices. However, it seems likely that growth will slow further in coming months as these headwinds intensify,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics said importers and retailers would likely absorb some of the increase in costs from the weak pound, ensuring that the squeeze on household incomes is not too intense. Low interest rates would also help support consumers, she said. \u201cWith ultra-accommodative monetary policy continuing to support spending and discourage saving, we don\u2019t think a sharp slowdown in spending is on the cards.\u201d A leading thinktank warned this week that the combination of rising inflation and weaker pay growth as Brexit unfolds will mean UK workers face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the recovery in real wages \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 will now be so slow that by 2021 they will still not be back to their 2008 level before the global financial crisis hit. For now, however, the ONS figures showed consumers remained the biggest driving force behind GDP growth. Household spending rose 0.7% in the third quarter, down only slightly from 0.9% growth in the second quarter. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg said: \u201cRather than postponing spending decisions amid the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote, good fundamentals \u2013 a strong labour market, rising house prices and improving credit conditions \u2013 supported a continued expansion in household spending.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May has been warned off plans to reform executive pay by leading figures from the world of economics and business, days after she abandoned a proposal to put workers on company boards. A report by independent thinktank the Big Innovation Centre urged the prime minister to rethink the detail of plans to reform the UK\u2019s corporate governance regime. The authors \u2013 including Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane and Clare Chapman, remuneration chief of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher \u2013 cast doubt on the wisdom of binding shareholder votes on executive rewards. They also criticised proposals to force firms to publish their pay ratio, which reflects the earnings difference between shopfloor workers and executives. Making investors\u2019 votes on executive remuneration legally binding would be a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d response that would have \u201cmany negative unintended consequences,\u201d the report claimed. It said shareholders would be less likely to vote against pay deals if they were binding, in case chief executives were destabilised or discouraged from staying in the role. Instead, they recommend that companies introduce a binding vote only after 25% of shareholders vote against the pay report two years in a row. On pay ratios, the report said that \u201calthough well-intentioned, snapshot pay ratios by themselves have the potential to create misleading comparisons and perverse incentives.\u201d It pointed out that retailers, which employ a large number of low-paid workers, would appear much more unequal than financial services firms, which do not. Ratios would also unduly penalise companies that offer non-cash benefits and favour firms that outsource their lowest paid jobs, the report said. The views run counter to plans unveiled by May to reform boardroom pay culture, as she seeks to show that the Conservative government has workers\u2019 interests at heart. The prime minister has already dropped one of her key proposals, telling the CBI conference this week that plans to put workers on company boards were no longer on the table. While the Big Innovation Centre\u2019s report, the first of a series, rejected pay ratios and binding votes, it made a series of recommendations to tackle excess pay. These include simpler pay structures that require directors to hold more shares, as well as the publication of a fair pay charter outlining the company\u2019s ethos on remuneration. The report also recommends a change in reporting requirements so the increase in the chief executive\u2019s wealth is directly compared to company performance. \u201cExecutive pay is a matter of profound and legitimate public interest,\u201d said Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, who was paid \u00a3195,000 by the Bank last year. \u201cPay practices can encourage short-term behaviour in ways which harm both firms and the economy over the long-term. \u201cMoving pay practices in non-financial firms towards those in financial firms can help in tackling those problems.\u201d Clare Chapman, who earned \u00a382,000 last year as Kingfisher\u2019s pay committee chief, said: \u201cAll of us involved in UK business are needing to rethink how we achieve growth in the new environment.\u201d \u201cWe support the government\u2019s objectives of rebuilding trust in executive pay, ensuring it is linked to long-term performance, and giving shareholders the right powers.\u201d As chair of Kingfisher\u2019s panel that sets executive pay, Chapman signed off on chief executive Veronique Laury\u2019s \u00a32m deal last year. The DIY firm\u2019s chief executive was paid less than a quarter of the \u00a38.6m that predecessor Ian Cheshire earned in 2012, when his package was inflated by a share award.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers hunting Black Friday bargains sparked a surge in online sales during the small hours but left high street stores looking deserted compared with the frantic scramble of previous years. Retailers\u2019 most eagerly awaited day of the year has increasingly been moving on to the web and the trend showed no signs of abating as online stores started racking up sales from midnight. John Rogers, the new chief executive officer of Argos, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme there had been 500,000 visits to the retailer\u2019s website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm \u2013 up 50% on last year. He said he expected traffic to peak between 7am and 10am as people shop on their mobile phones on their way to work. Rogers predicted that Argos would take 70% or more of its orders onlinetoday compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company was better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems. Online retailers have this year taken extra precautions to prevent online meltdown and overloaded websites crashing. Currys PC World\u2019s Black Friday 2016 deals webpage suffered problems just after midnight, according to tweets from furious \u201cearly bird\u201d shoppers. The first UK bargain-hunters reported frustratingly slow loading times and pages timing out. \u201cCurrys how is this happening?\u201d one user tweeted. Another posted: \u201cbit of a joke you being currys pcworld and your website crashing. Remind me never to go to you for a PC!\u201d A spokeswoman said: \u201cCurrys PC World\u2019s website experienced a few issues for a short period of 15 minutes just after midnight. The majority of customers were still able to access the site and place orders but we understand that some shoppers had problems loading the pages. \u201cThis was quickly rectified and we have had no further reported issues. We\u2019ve already seen over half a million visitors to the site between midnight and 6am this morning (with orders up 40% for the same period last year) with the Google Chromecast, Samsung Galaxy Tablets and JVC 32in TVs being the most popular items for shoppers.\u201d While online retailers were busy, stores were off to a slow start. At the Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London, there were only 11 people in the queue when the supermarket opened at 5am \u2013 barely outnumbering the security guards. Some of those queuing had been there since 4.30am and were surprised how few people had turned up compared with last year. Tony was queuing up for a \u201cmust-have\u201d Hatchimal toy after being unable to get one for his children online. \u201cI\u2019ll either go home a hero or if they haven\u2019t got one I\u2019ll be home in bed in half an hour,\u201d he told the Guardian. Most of those in the queue were planning to pick up a TV from the large pile just inside the door. But it was more of a saunter than a scramble once the doors opened. Michael, who bought two TVs, said: \u201cThis is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u2019s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke. Frederic said he\u2019d come along to look at the deals but had not bought anything. \u201cLast year there was a big queue and we had to call a car. We got a TV and a microwave. This time it\u2019s too small. There\u2019s not something I need, it\u2019s just TVs and coffee machines,\u201d he said. Martin Francis, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon. He said hundreds more TVs would be delivered over the weekend. \u201cIt will give us additional spend later on when people come in to do their normal shop,\u201d he said. Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay was equally quiet and it was about 5.50am before even a small queue gathered outside. The branch was one of just three the retailer opened early for the sale, and had been closed since midnight in preparation. Two years ago, the shop was the scene of scuffles and queue jumping, but this year things were very different. At 5.45am, a huddle of workers were being briefed near the door, but not a single person was waiting. The huge banner urging shoppers to \u201cHurry, while stocks last\u201d had not persuaded the people of this part of north London to set their alarm clocks. One woman waiting outside ahead of doors opening said she was there to buy a TV: \u201cI might get something else but my main aim is to get a big TV.\u201d She said this was her first Black Friday. \u201cI wasn\u2019t keen on coming before \u2013 I didn\u2019t like the idea of fighting.\u201d No one else was keen to talk about what they were after. Through the doors a pile of TVs, vacuum cleaners, laptops and Nutri Ninjas was visible, and as the doors opened five minutes early, what little crowd there was made a beeline straight for the stack of goods. About half an hour later the shop floor was still looking pretty pristine. People who came to the store stopped to take a look, but most just left with what they\u2019d come in for, or nothing. A couple who formed part of the original queue left with just a bag of groceries. One of the store workers said it had been quiet last year too: \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing their shopping online.\u201d The TV hunter had loaded a 40-inch Blaupunkt set \u2013 down from \u00a3220 to \u00a3150 \u2013 into her trolley, but after 40 minutes she emerged empty handed. She had bought a TV \u2013 but one from elsewhere in the store, and she was going to send her son to pick it up. She said she was not surprised the shop was quiet. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to come out because of the fighting. They are doing it all online.\u201d",

But it was more of a saunter than a scramble once the doors opened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51135ad7dad86e0218136250f74fbb879d5d833c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51135ad7dad86e0218136250f74fbb879d5d833c/0_300_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Currys PC World: Michael and Tarrell from Wandsworth, who bought two flatscreen TVs at Tesco in Streatham, south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Currys PC World: Michael and Tarrell from Wandsworth, who bought two flatscreen TVs at Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael, who bought two TVs, said: \u201cThis is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u2019s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u201d He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke.</p> <p>Frederic said he\u2019d come along to look at the deals but had not bought anything. </p> <p>\u201cLast year there was a big queue and we had to call a car. We got a TV and a microwave. This time it\u2019s too small. There\u2019s not something I need, it\u2019s just TVs and coffee machines,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Martin Francis, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon. He said hundreds more TVs would be delivered over the weekend. \u201cIt will give us additional spend later on when people come in to do their normal shop,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f1fab4eb06be783d598e0d372d6278e2bebbf87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f1fab4eb06be783d598e0d372d6278e2bebbf87/0_105_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue for Black Friday sales at Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue for Black Friday sales at Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay was equally quiet and it was about 5.50am before even a small queue gathered outside. The branch was one of just three the retailer opened early for the sale, and had been closed since midnight in preparation. </p> <p>Two years ago, the shop was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/28/black-friday-sales-police-attend-supermarkets-amid-scuffles \">scene of scuffles</a> and queue jumping, but this year things were very different. </p> <p>At 5.45am, a huddle of workers were being briefed near the door, but not a single person was waiting. The huge banner urging shoppers to \u201cHurry, while stocks last\u201d had not persuaded the people of this part of north London to set their alarm clocks. </p> <p>One woman waiting outside ahead of doors opening said she was there to buy a TV: \u201cI might get something else but my main aim is to get a big TV.\u201d She said this was her first Black Friday. \u201cI wasn\u2019t keen on coming before \u2013 I didn\u2019t like the idea of fighting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3539e6a44519af1f90ee6298d5377635378461d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3539e6a44519af1f90ee6298d5377635378461d1/0_110_1745_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Friday shoppers at Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay, north London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Friday shoppers at Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay, north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hilary Osborne for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one else was keen to talk about what they were after. Through the doors a pile of TVs, vacuum cleaners, laptops and Nutri Ninjas was visible, and as the doors opened five minutes early, what little crowd there was made a beeline straight for the stack of goods. </p> <p>About half an hour later the shop floor was still looking pretty pristine. People who came to the store stopped to take a look, but most just left with what they\u2019d come in for, or nothing. </p> <p>A couple who formed part of the original queue left with just a bag of groceries. One of the store workers said it had been quiet last year too: \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing their shopping online.\u201d </p> <p>The TV hunter had loaded a 40-inch Blaupunkt set \u2013 down from \u00a3220 to \u00a3150 \u2013 into her trolley, but after 40 minutes she emerged empty handed. She had bought a TV \u2013 but one from elsewhere in the store, and she was going to send her son to pick it up. She said she was not surprised the shop was quiet. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to come out because of the fighting. They are doing it all online.\u201d</p>",
