The Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates major banks, building societies and insurance companies, has included the proposal as part of an extensive consultation on implementing an EU directive more usually associated with capping bonuses and requiring banks to raise more capital to plug shortfalls on their balance sheets.

    "webTitle": "Shareholder revolts double in three years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shareholder revolts against auditors have increased as City investors clamp down on close ties between companies and their accountants. Votes withholding support from auditor-related resolutions at the annual general meetings of the 350 biggest companies on the stock market doubled in the first half of this year from 2010, figures from Pirc, the corporate governance consultant, show. The Competition Commission this year criticised inertia and lack of competition in the audit market. It found that the big four accountants \u2013 PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 audited all but one of the companies in the FTSE 100 and that more than 70% of companies had not put their audit contract out to tender for at least 15 years. But the commission pulled back from imposing compulsory rotation of auditors and recommended competition for audit contracts at least every five years. Shareholders are now putting pressure on boards to make sure audits are rigorous and independent. Pirc said investor action was overdue after accountants signed off banks' accounts months before the same banks nearly collapsed in the financial meltdown. A Pirc spokesman said: \"It's a good thing that investors are using their ownership rights to challenge companies over audit-related issues more frequently. If companies want to turn this around then they need to focus on the issues that concern investors, like the auditor undertaking non-audit work that is more financially valuable than the audit itself.\" Figures from Pirc show 3.14% of votes failing to support auditor resolutions in the first half of this year, compared with 1.57% in the same period in 2010. The resolutions proposed rehiring of auditors or giving the board authority to set fees. At Pennon's annual meeting this month, 49% of votes withheld support for the board to set fees for PwC. The water company paid PwC \u00a3721,000 to audit the group and its subsidiaries but more than double that for other services, including \u00a3880,000 for corporate finance work. Inmarsat suffered a 38% rebellion at its AGM in May. The mobile satellite company's \u00a31.2m audit fees to Deloitte were outstripped by \u00a31.9m for other work, including \u00a31.3m for tax advice. Others hit by revolts include technology company Laird, with a 44% rebellion, and Unite Group, where 42% failed to support the audit resolution at the student accommodation provider. Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at fund manager Threadneedle, said the votes told only part of the story, because some companies had averted disputes by putting audit contracts out to tender. \"They responded very constructively to the issue being raised and are acting on it. In these cases we and other shareholders recognise that and don't take voting action.\" But he added: \"The audit is one of the key shareholder protection mechanisms and if companies start impairing it we have a problem.\" HSBC, whose \u00a352m audit contract is the biggest in the UK, chose PwC as its auditor this month. Though it kept the work within the big four, the decision ended the bank's more than 20-year relationship with KPMG. Barclays has said it will consider putting its audit out to tender this year. Ivor Pether, a fund manager at Royal London, said: \"The role of auditors has been a weakness in the past that was allowed to continue. This is indicative of a lower level of trust. Auditor fees were sometimes waived through with a cursory explanation and that is no longer adequate. The whole financial crisis has highlighted the dangers of not focusing on governance. Investors have come out rather chastened and aware that processes need to be considerably more rigorous.\" The rise in auditor disputes this year has coincided with sustained pressure on pay deals after last year's shareholder spring. Failure to support pay reports fell only slightly to 9.28% in the first half of 2013 from 9.36% a year earlier. Pirc said: \"Although the fireworks of last AGM season have not been repeated, shareholders are continuing to keep the pressure up. It may be that because FTSE 100 companies have not generally been in the firing line, large votes against [the board] are going unnoticed.\"",

      "body": "<p>Shareholder revolts against auditors have increased as City investors clamp down on close ties between companies and their accountants.</p> <p>Votes withholding support from auditor-related resolutions at the annual general meetings of the 350 biggest companies on the stock market doubled in the first half of this year from 2010, figures from Pirc, the corporate governance consultant, show.</p> <p>The Competition Commission this year criticised inertia and lack of competition in the audit market. It found that the big four accountants \u2013 PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 audited all but one of the companies in the FTSE 100 and that more than 70% of companies had not put their audit contract out to tender for at least 15 years.</p> <p>But the commission <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/22/competition-commission-accountancy-shakeup\" title=\"\">pulled back from imposing compulsory rotation of auditors and recommended competition for audit contracts at least every five years</a>. Shareholders are now putting pressure on boards to make sure audits are rigorous and independent.</p> <p>Pirc said investor action was overdue after accountants signed off banks' accounts months before the same banks nearly collapsed in the financial meltdown.</p> <p>A Pirc spokesman said: \"It's a good thing that investors are using their ownership rights to challenge companies over audit-related issues more frequently. If companies want to turn this around then they need to focus on the issues that concern investors, like the auditor undertaking non-audit work that is more financially valuable than the audit itself.\"</p> <p>Figures from Pirc show 3.14% of votes failing to support auditor resolutions in the first half of this year, compared with 1.57% in the same period in 2010. The resolutions proposed rehiring of auditors or giving the board authority to set fees.</p> <p>At Pennon's annual meeting this month, 49% of votes withheld support for the board to set fees for PwC. The water company paid PwC \u00a3721,000 to audit the group and its subsidiaries but more than double that for other services, including \u00a3880,000 for corporate finance work.</p> <p>Inmarsat suffered a 38% rebellion at its AGM in May. The mobile satellite company's \u00a31.2m audit fees to Deloitte were outstripped by \u00a31.9m for other work, including \u00a31.3m for tax advice.</p> <p>Others hit by revolts include technology company Laird, with a 44% rebellion, and Unite Group, where 42% failed to support the audit resolution at the student accommodation provider.</p> <p>Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at fund manager Threadneedle, said the votes told only part of the story, because some companies had averted disputes by putting audit contracts out to tender.</p> <p>\"They responded very constructively to the issue being raised and are acting on it. In these cases we and other shareholders recognise that and don't take voting action.\" But he added: \"The audit is one of the key shareholder protection mechanisms and if companies start impairing it we have a problem.\"</p> <p>HSBC, whose \u00a352m audit contract is the biggest in the UK, chose PwC as its auditor this month. Though it kept the work within the big four, the decision ended the bank's more than 20-year relationship with KPMG.</p> <p>Barclays has said it will consider putting its audit out to tender this year.</p> <p>Ivor Pether, a fund manager at Royal London, said: \"The role of auditors has been a weakness in the past that was allowed to continue. This is indicative of a lower level of trust. Auditor fees were sometimes waived through with a cursory explanation and that is no longer adequate. The whole financial crisis has highlighted the dangers of not focusing on governance. Investors have come out rather chastened and aware that processes need to be considerably more rigorous.\"</p> <p>The rise in auditor disputes this year has coincided with sustained pressure on pay deals after last year's shareholder spring. Failure to support pay reports fell only slightly to 9.28% in the first half of 2013 from 9.36% a year earlier.</p> <p>Pirc said: \"Although the fireworks of last AGM season have not been repeated, shareholders are continuing to keep the pressure up. It may be that because FTSE 100 companies have not generally been in the firing line, large votes against [the board] are going unnoticed.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It all used to be so simple for the Bank of England. In those days long ago when inflation was low and steady and the economy seemed to purr along, Threadneedle Street gave the odd tweak to the cost of borrowing and that was that. The granting of independence to the Bank by Gordon Brown in 1997 was seen as a masterstroke \u2013 taking policy out of the hands of incompetent and meddling politicians and handing it to able technocrats. That was then. For the past six years, ever since the financial crisis broke, the conduct of monetary policy has been anything but simple. It involves more than the occasional quarter-point change in the official cost of borrowing. There are those who say the activist approach adopted by the Bank has put its credibility and independence at risk. All these issues came to a head last week when the new governor, Mark Carney, provided forward guidance about the future course of policy. The Bank wanted to signal that it would only raise interest rates or unwind its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme in exceptional circumstances. Carney was parachuted into the Bank by George Osborne with the brief of making Threadneedle Street a more growth-friendly institution and he has wasted no time in getting on with the job. The chancellor has done his bit to pump up growth through his subsidies to the housing market, but he expects most of the heavy lifting to be done by the Bank. Hence last week's commitment to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5% until unemployment comes down from 7.8% to 7% or less. Hence, also, the concerns about the Bank's independence and its credibility. In truth, these concerns are not new. The Bank's independence was called into question when the previous governor, Lord King, gave such strong backing to Osborne's austerity programme. And the Old Lady's credibility has been on the line for at least half a decade, a period in which it first failed to deal with the bubbles in the financial and housing markets, was then slow to cut rates when the economy nosedived into recession, and has subsequently turned a blind eye to above-target inflation. Carney's arrival has merely put these concerns into sharper focus. Criticism of the way the Bank is conducting monetary policy also needs to be put into context, because the ultra-loose approach adopted by the Bank is the flipside to the ultra-tight policy adopted by Osborne. Work by the American academic Alan Taylor has estimated the cost of austerity to the British economy. The results show that GDP would be 3% higher without the combination of tax increases and spending cuts \u2013 sufficient to bring national output close to where it was before the recession began. Changes to tax and spending are even more potent when interest rates are at rock bottom (or, in the jargon of the profession, at the zero interest-rate bound). Preferably, Osborne should lay off the austerity and so take some of the pressure off the Bank to provide all the stimulus through a monetary policy that needs to grow ever more unorthodox to have an impact. It means buying up a third of the gilts market and providing a signal that interest rates will stay at barely above zero for years to come. Nobody knows how this will all end. The long-term prospects for the economy would certainly not be harmed, and would probably be improved, by a different mix of policy. That might, for example, involve higher capital spending on house-building and cuts in payroll taxes to encourage employers to take on young workers, offset by a slightly less stimulative monetary policy. That is not on offer given the government's belief that the Bank should be active and the Treasury (largely) passive when it comes to growth. For the Bank to continue to keep the pedal to the metal, a couple of changes have been required. It has necessitated tweaking the Bank's legal mandate to hit a 2% inflation target. And it has meant relying on a relationship between inflation and unemployment that those of us with long memories recall as the Phillips curve. This, needless to say, is all a bit of gamble but considered worth it by Carney and Osborne. Why? Because the economy has so massively under-performed in recent years that most (if not all) analysts think there is quite a lot of spare capacity that could be used up before inflationary pressures start to appear. The main evidence for this is that when the unemployment rate hovered around 5% in the first half of the 2000s, growth in average earnings held steady at, on average, 4% a year. The unemployment rate is currently 7.8%, there has been a general attrition of skills during the recession and its aftermath, and the jobless total came down substantially without causing inflation to pick up. This is the new version of the Phillips curve, the relationship between wage growth and unemployment plotted by the LSE economist Bill Phillips in the 1950s. Until Milton Friedman came along, policymakers used to believe that the Phillips curve provided a menu of options: they could choose to have a bit less inflation if they were prepared to tolerate a bit more unemployment. This line of thinking went out of fashion from the mid-1970s, but now it is back. The Bank clearly believes that it can push down joblessness without any risk to inflation. Indeed, the 7% threshold set by the Bank for considering the need for tighter policy looks quite conservative. That may be because Carney got some push-back from other members of the monetary policy committee and so had to come up with a compromise. But there is no reason, given the weak bargaining position of employees, why there should be a need for the Bank to move until the jobless rate reaches 6.5% or lower. If there is inflationary pressure in the economy, it will probably show up elsewhere: in a rising trade deficit and in house prices. That, at least, is the evidence from the long boom of the 1990s and early 2000s. There are those who say that none of this solves the long-term problems of the economy, and they are right. Those who say this is the wrong sort of growth have a point too. But Osborne won't give two hoots about that. There is now a policy regime in place that should guarantee the economy is growing at a fair lick in the runup to the election. If the coalition loses in 2015 it won't be because the economy is in recession, but because living standards are lower at the end of the parliament than they were at the start.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has already been fined \u00a31.2bn for breaching money-laundering rules and Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays hit with major penalties for rigging Libor, but over the past two weeks Britain's major banks have warned shareholders of the wide range of investigations they still face that could lead to even more fines. Some of the information in more than 30 pages of legal disclosures released during the banks' recent results dates back more than 10 years \u2013 such as HSBC's admission about a long-running complaint relating to its takeover of Household International in the US in 2002. Other details reveal a common theme, such as ongoing investigations into Libor rigging that saw Barclays and RBS pay \u00a3290m and \u00a3390m respectively. A number of the banks cite the implications of a competition investigation into interchange fees in the MasterCard network as well as European investigation into credit default swaps, the derivatives that were thrown into focus during the eurozone crisis when they provided a gauge to market fears of a country defaulting on its debt. In many instances the banks are unable to quantify, as yet, the impact of ongoing cases \u2013 although RBS provided the most detailed warning of potential future fines by setting aside \u00a3385m to cover legal costs associated with unspecified regulatory actions. HSBC \u25a0 The bank faces litigation dating back to 2002 over its acquisition of Household International and alleged misleading statements about its consumer lending division. The case should be completed next month, but HSBC says it will have grounds for appeal. The bank has set aside $3.5bn. \u25a0 The jailing of Bernie Madoff for 150 years left HSBC facing various claims, as it acted as a custodian and administrator to a number of Madoff funds. It is not able to quantify the size of any losses. \u25a0 The US Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is suing over the selling of mortgage-backed securities and could land HSBC with a $1.6bn bill. The bank warned there may be \"additional claims litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny\". \u25a0 Already fined $1.9bn for breaking anti-money-laundering rules, the bank is subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US department of justice. Private litigation is not ruled out. \u25a0 An ongoing investigation in the US into whether some customers should have reported US tax could leave the bank with \"significant\" penalties. \u25a0 Investigation into Libor rigging could leave HSBC facing \"fines and penalties\" which \"could be significant\". It is also named in private lawsuits. \u25a0 The European commission investigation into credit default swaps is looking at anti-competitive behaviour between 2006 and 2009. HSBC warns that it cannot assess the impact of this investigation, and class actions have been filed in federal courts in Chicago and New York. BARCLAYS \u25a0 After it acquired the Wall Street operations of the collapsed Lehman Brothers in 2008, the trustee of the estate complained about the terms of the deal. Barclays admitted it could lose out if it receives no money from the liquidators of Lehman but warned there was a \"significant degree of uncertainty\". \u25a0 Five class-action suits on behalf of US shareholders argue that Barclays gave misleading statements about the value of its mortgage-related assets between 2006 and 2008. Barclays is defending the cases and warns it cannot estimate potential losses. \u25a0 The Federal Housing Finance Agency is also investigating Barclays over mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. \u25a0 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and other competition authorities are investigating Visa and MasterCard interchange fees \u2013 Barclays warns it is not possible to predict the outcome. \u25a0 Having fined Barclays \u00a3290m for rigging Libor, the New York attorney general subpoenaed the bank and others for information. Barclays is not able to estimate the financial impact. \u25a0 It is fighting a $470m penalty by the US federal energy regulatory commission over power trading in California. \u25a0 The European commission is looking at accusations of anti-competitive behaviour in the credit default swap market \u2013 Barclays is not able to assess the impact or timing. \u25a0 The bank has received preliminary findings of the investigation by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into the disclosure of fees at the time of its 2008 fundraisings. It is contesting the findings. The Serious Fraud Office and the US authorities are also investigating. LLOYDS BANKING GROUP \u25a0 The bank is facing claims in the German courts over policies issued by its insurance arm Clerical Medical, for which a \u00a3400m provision has been made. It warned the final tally \"could be significantly different\". \u25a0 In talks with the Prudential Regulation Authority, the FCA and others over undisclosed matters, a \u00a3100m provision was taken in 2012. \u25a0 The competition investigation into interchange fees paid through MasterCard is ongoing and the impact will only be known once completed. \u25a0 Some parts of the group have received requests for information in the Libor-rigging investigation but Lloyds is not able to predict the outcome and scope of the analysis. \u25a0 A complaint from shareholders in the US about \"material omissions\" in statements issued during the rescue takeover of HBOS has been rejected in a US court but is now the subject of an appeal. Lloyds says it is without merit. \u25a0 It is awaiting the outcome of a report by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) into what went wrong at HBOS. ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND \u25a0 RBS faces class actions in the US and in the high court from shareholders complaining about the accuracy of financial information published by the bank in public documents. \u25a0 It is also being investigated alongside HSBC and Barclays by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over the selling of mortgage bonds. \u25a0 On top of a \u00a3390m fine for rigging Libor, complaints have been filed in the US alleging that the bank broke federal laws. RBS is contesting them and continues to co-operate with ongoing investigations. \u25a0 The European commission is investigating anti-competitive behaviour in the credit default swaps market, which RBS is defending. \u25a0 Trustees for the bankrupt Madoff estate are seeking more than $200m from RBS, which the bank is defending. \u25a0 It faces enforcement action from the FCA over its IT failure in 2012 and has warned of litigation from customers. \u25a0 The impact of the competition investigation into interchange fees paid through MasterCard, it said, would only be known once completed. \u25a0 A mystery shopping exercise by the FSA into how RBS provided investment advice to customers required the bank to review its training procedures. RBS has warned it could be forced to appoint an independent third party to oversee the work.\u25a0 The OFT investigation into competition in small business banking launched in June could have a \"material impact\" on the bank. \u25a0 A cease and desist order issued in July 2011 over risk management and compliance systems in its US operation RBS Citizens is still in place after it was accused of \"deceptive marketing\". Citizens neither admitted nor denied the allegations. \u25a0 An investigation over its compliance with US economic sanctions could have a \"material adverse\" effect on its results.",

      "bodyText": "This is the time of year when my Treasury friends are likely to say, with just a hint of menace, \"Enjoy the exchange rate you have so long advocated.\" This, of course, is a reference to the way continental holidays have become a lot more expensive than they were, thanks to the devaluation of the pound that was a necessary condition of restoring British industry's price competitiveness after a long period, under the Conservatives and Labour, of overvaluation. Traditionally the Bank of England does not believe in devaluation, or at least in advocating such a policy in public. Lord King, who was governor from July 2003 to June this year, made no secret later on in his term that the devaluation was a necessary condition of his plan to \"rebalance\" the British economy. Whether our economy is rebalancing towards a healthier overseas trading position is an open question. Chancellor Osborne seems of late, in the face of the demise of his eccentric, damaging and oxymoronic policy of \"expansionary fiscal contraction\" to be relying partly on an old-fashioned boom in house prices \u2013 the sort of development that contributed to the financial crisis in the first place. Oh, sorry, I nearly forgot: the chancellor is also relying on the putatively magical powers of Mark Carney, Lord King's successor, who is rapidly acquiring the kind of showbiz reputation we have not seen in central banking since Che Guevara was governor of the central bank of Cuba. We have yet to see how successful Carney will be in the role of revolutionary. His paper on forward guidance for the financial and other markets in monetary policy, published last week, is supposed to give key decision-makers in industry and finance some assurance about the prospects for interest rates when they're making their investment decisions, and make decisions about mortgages easier. His main message was that the financial markets had got ahead of themselves in expecting any tightening of monetary policy in the foreseeable future. A recovery may be under way, but it is weak by historical standards, and there is still a significant margin of spare capacity. That shrewd fellow Canadian student of politics, Professor Colin Campbell, spotted early on that Carney hails from the central casting school of central banking, whose de facto head is Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve. They are both \"growth men\", with a desire not to slow down an economic revival until unemployment falls to a certain level. As recent panics in the financial markets have demonstrated, however, the guidance of markets is more easily promised than achieved. Anyone who listened to what Bernanke was saying last month should have got the message that he was worried about the negative impact on the US recovery of the Republican-induced \"sequestration\" budget cuts. Carney, who uses phrases such as the need for \"escape velocity\" is, for all the hype, up against the limits of monetary policy in time of depression, with the added problems of his political mentor's austerity policy. Did I say depression? According to some reports, it is now \"boom, boom Britain\", although output is still below 2007 levels. We shall see. At all events, Carney is reduced to what the Americans call \"jawboning\" \u2013 a talent he put to good effect at his first inflation report press conference last Wednesday. He followed that session with some further jawboning to selected City and other leading economists at a separate lunchtime session. He has certainly made a splash so far. Indeed, one can hardly get away from news about him. Why, the other weekend I was lunching with the economist Simon Broadbent in the garden of his house in Dorchester-on-Thames, and asked about the history of Dorchester abbey, which adjoins the Broadbents' garden. \"Before we get on to that,\" he said, \"you may or not like to know that that is where Mark Carney got married.\" We now await evidence of his divine, or divining, powers. We learn that, among other things, the Treasury wants him to shake up the Bank. Tell me something new. When I was editor of the economic section of the Bank of England bulletin in the mid-1970s the new governor Gordon Richardson and chief economist Christopher Dow were trying to shake up the Bank. (By the way, when I returned to journalism, Broadbent succeeded me. We recalled the other day that in our time there was lots of inflation, but no monthly inflation report.) One gathers that there is quite a lot of shaking going on in Threadneedle Street \u2013 a lot more than the high-profile resignations of people like my friend Paul Tucker. Certainly, Osborne is relying heavily on Carney, having given him a financial salary \"package\" that thoroughly upset many, and not just at the Bank. Carney spent a lot of time refusing Osborne's overtures. His refusals were \"right at the time\". David Marsh, chairman of the OMFIF (Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum), has a nice theory that Carney's final wage demand was made on the assumption that Austerity Osborne would have no choice but to turn down such a ridiculous request. This said, I am encouraged by the emphasis Carney is putting on the need to reduce unemployment, which is still a million higher than when the financial crisis struck. The new player at the Bank of England may, in due course, justify his transfer fee.",
