      "bodyText": "Austerity budgets adopted by governments across the world since the 2008 financial crash are to blame for undermining the job security of millions of workers and threatening the progress made by women in the workplace, according to a UN report. The threat to jobs from the growing use of robots and artificial intelligence has been exacerbated by a lack of government investment and lack of state support for skills training, the report also said. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said in its annual report, Beyond Austerity \u2013 Towards a Global New Deal, that the contraction of government spending meant that \u201cthe increasingly limited availability of good jobs\u201d were going to men rather than women. \u201cExcluding women from good jobs deepens overall inequality with negative consequences for growth,\u201d it said. The report argued that giving women access to decent employment could only be achieved if governments maintained investment in affordable childcare facilities and care for the elderly. When they make steep cuts in early-years education and healthcare provision they are effectively asking women to pick up the slack, it said. \u201cThere is much more to do to reach gender equality in employment than to increase the participation of women in markets and boardrooms,\u201d said Unctad\u2019s secretary general, Mukhisa Kituyi. The report said: \u201cGiven the employment challenges associated with structural and technological change, and women\u2019s primary responsibility for care work, Unctad recommends transforming unpaid and paid care activities into decent work\u201d The rebuke of governments, including the UK\u2019s, that have adopted austerity measures to reduce public debt while allowing households\u2019 private debt to increase, is the main theme of the report. Last year\u2019s annual report highlighted fears of a debt crisis in developing countries as the threat of falling commodity prices and higher interest rates mounted. Low interest rates and the stimulus from quantitative easing have remained in place, easing the threat, but only in response to gloomy forecasts for GDP growth should either be withdrawn. Kituyi, the former head of the Kenya Institute of Governance, said: \u201cDespite all the talk of the urgency of reform at the time of the financial crisis, and recent claims that the financial system is safer, simpler and fairer, regulatory actions have so far done little more than clip the wings of high-flying finance, with lending now somewhat backed by capital and a bit less trading in the shadows. \u201cThe public purse was used generously to prevent the financial sector going under in 2007-08, but the root causes of financial instability have not been addressed by national governments or on a global scale.\u201d Austerity was heightening fears that robots and artificial intelligence would displace workers in well-paid jobs rather than enhance their work and improve productivity, the report said. It argues for digitally focused industrial policies to ensure that robotics support jobs rather than threaten them. Richard Kozul-Wright, the director of Unctad\u2019s globalisation and development strategies division, said concerns about robots were mounting against a backdrop of uncertainty over the strength of the global economy. \u201cThis has held back the investment needed to create new sectors, where workers displaced by robots could find better jobs,\u201d he said. Routine tasks in well-paying manufacturing and service jobs are being replaced by robots, the report said, but low-wage manufacturing jobs in areas such as clothing factories are left largely unaffected by automation. \u201cAlthough most jobs in developing countries are not under immediate threat, a tendency to further concentrate manufacturing activity in existing locations could follow, raising concerns that the gap between winners and losers from robot use will widen sharply,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has raised the prospect of an interest rate rise as early as November, in an attempt to relieve the squeeze on living standards from surging prices and sluggish wage growth. On Thursday, Threadneedle Street left interest rates at their record low of 0.25% amid fears over Brexit, but dropped a heavy hint that the first increase in the cost of borrowing for a decade may come sooner than expected if the economy continues to strengthen. Financial markets now suggest there is a 42% chance of a rate increase in November, up from just 18% a week ago. The odds on a December rise are now 54%. The squeeze on households and a strengthening economy mean \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months\u201d, the Bank said. It added that a majority of the interest rate setting committee agreed with that assessment, and the governor, Mark Carney, later confirmed that he shared the majority view. The pound jumped more than 1% against the dollar and the euro as the financial markets digested the impact of the comments. Such strong hints on likely rate changes are not usual. Raising the cost of borrowing would reverse the emergency rate cut introduced by Carney in August 2016 in the wake of the Brexit referendum. It would also raise the cost of mortgages for the first time for millions of homebuyers who have never experienced a rise in their monthly repayments as a result of a rate change. Nationwide\u2019s base mortgage rate would rise from 2.25% to 2.5%, meaning repayments on a \u00a3100,000 mortgage would rise \u00a313 a month to \u00a3449. A \u00a3200,000 mortgage would go up by \u00a325 to \u00a3897. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets borrowing rates, was split, with the external economists Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty calling for an immediate rise to 0.5% to keep inflation in check. In a television interview after the decision, Carney said he and the MPC were \u201cbeginning to shift\u201d on when to raise rates. \u201cWe will take that decision based on the data. I guess that possibility has definitely increased,\u201d he said. Explaining its view, the Bank pointed to encouraging recent indicators of economic strength. Data this week showed unemployment has reached a 42-year low of 4.3%, while there are signs household consumption is stronger than expected and the weaker pound is also expected to boost British trade. However, despite the very low levels of unemployment, wages have yet to move significantly higher. The Office for National Statistics found average earnings had risen by just 2.1% in the three months to July, leaving workers facing a 0.4% real-terms fall in the value of their pay packets . Sebastian Burnside, senior economist at NatWest, said: \u201cHow do you resolve this dilemma? \u2018Not just yet\u2019 seems to be the verdict of the MPC. They want to wait to see some more wage growth, but are prepared to act before it really takes off.\u201d The Bank said there were \u201cconsiderable risks\u201d on the horizon as ministers hold talks in Brussels over exiting the European Union. This could feed through to damage the economy if households, businesses and the financial markets react badly to the faltering progress. The Bank\u2019s MPC said: \u201cThe circumstances since the referendum on EU membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, have been exceptional.\u201d Sharply rising inflation has put pressure on the MPC to increase the base rate in recent weeks, as households come under pressure from prices rising faster than earnings. Consumer prices were 2.9% higher in August than in the same month a year ago, after standing at 2.6% in July. The MPC expects inflation to increase further still in the coming months with the consumer price index likely to top 3% in October. The Bank has a mandate to target an inflation rate of 2% and increasing the base rate could reduce that rate. Although GDP growth in the first months of the year was at the slowest pace since 2012, there are signs that there will be a faster pace of expansion in the second half of the year. However, given the uncertainty about the type of Brexit deal ministers will be able to forge with Brussels, the Bank said it must strike a fine balance between cutting inflation and maintaining its support for jobs and business activity through the cheaper cost of borrowing. It is also maintaining its \u00a3445bn quantitative easing programme. The MPC said: \u201cDuring the negotiation period, those economic implications would be influenced significantly by the expectations of households, firms and financial markets. [The Bank must] take account of these evolving expectations in setting monetary policy insofar as they affected the outlook for activity and inflation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England hints at November interest rate rise, sending pound to one-year high - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The City of London is bracing for UK interest rates to rise before the end of 2017, after the Bank of England has dropped its loudest hint yet that borrowing costs will soon go up. The financial markets are now pricing a roughly 50% probability that rates will rise from their current record low, of 0.25%, in November. A rate hike is fully \u2018priced in\u2019 by next February. Nailing his credibility to the mast, BoE governor Mark Carney has declared tonight that the possibility of a rate hike has \u201cdefinitely increased\u201d. Carney says: The majority of members of the (Monetary Policy) Committee, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift, and that in order to ... return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates in the coming months. \u201cNow, we will take that decision based on the data. I guess that possibility has definitely increased.\u201d The comments came after the BoE left interest rates unchanged, with just two of its nine policymakers voting for a hike. But the minutes of the meeting stated that rates are likely to rise faster than the markets expect, and that a majority of MPC members expect to tighten policy \u2018in the coming months\u2019. The comments sent the pound soaring by two cents to $1.34, a one-year high. It also wiped more than 1% off top shares in London. Some City analysts have predicted that rates could rise in November, when the BoE will also have new economic forecasts in its clutches. For example, Charles St-Arnaud, Senior Investment Strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, says: If growth remains strong, which is likely based on the current business survey readings, and inflation continues to accelerate, we would not be surprised if the Bank of England increased its policy rate before the end of 2017. Therefore, we see further scope for market repricing In terms of timing, the release of the Inflation Report at the November meeting provides a good opportunity for the Bank of England to act at that time, if current conditions continue to remain in place.\u201d But others argue that the Bank will maintain its reputation for talk, but not action. Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada suspects that, despite Carney\u2019s bold talk, the first rate hike in a decade might not come until 2018... As this is the last meeting before the MPC\u2019s projections are updated for the November Inflation Report, we think that if the Committee wanted to firmly signal a hike for that meeting, it would have chosen a different form of words than \u2018over the coming months\u2019. In our view, the minutes don\u2019t communicate whether or not November 2017 or February 2018 is more likely, just that a move at either of those meetings is more likely than it was back in August. A more hawkish intent, but a long way from a pre-commitment to a November hike. What\u2019s unarguable, though, is that November\u2019s MPC meeting will be extremely exciting.... Here\u2019s our full news story on the situation: And on that note, let\u2019s wrap up for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Britain\u2019s leading share index has ended the day in the red, shedding more than 1%. The surging pound hit the share prices of major exporters. Britain\u2019s housebuilders were also among the top fallers, with analysts saying that housing demand would suffer from higher interest rates. Mining giants also took a hit from weak Chinese economic data overnight; retail sales, industrial production and company investment all missed forecasts, suggesting weaker demand for metals. This all left the FTSE 100 looking decidedly unperky, down 84 points at 7295. Not every share suffered, though. Banks rose, on the prospect of higher profitability if rates go up. And Next had a storming day, up 13% after telling shareholders this morning that it was doing better than expected this year. Breaking! A flurry of comments from Mark \u201cSnapchat\u201d Carney have just hit the newswires. The Bank of England\u2019s governor has told a TV interview that: The possibility of a rate hike has definitely increased, and rates may need to be adjusted in the coming months. There has been a \u2018shift\u2019 in the balancing act which the Bank is performing UK prices are going up because of the drop in the pound. He was among the majority on MPC who believe some withdrawal of monetary stimulus will be needed in the coming months, if the economy follows its current path. This is sending City traders scrambling to buy the pound, in anticipation of an interest rate rise soon. Sterling has spiked to $1.3394, a jump of around two cents today, to a new one-year high. Here\u2019s a sentence I never expected to write. The Bank of England has created a new Snapchat filter to mark the launch of the Jane Austen \u00a310. Governor Mark Carney looks terribly pleased about it too: I can\u2019t imagine many of Carney\u2019s predecessors posing in a flurry of new tenners. Perhaps we\u2019ll be able to reuse it if the Bank ever launches helicopter money.... In the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting, the Bank of England states that it wants to see a \u201ccontinued erosion of slack\u201d before raising interest rates. They are referring to slack in the labour market - when it runs out, firms are forced to offer higher wages which can feed through to inflation. Britain\u2019s employment rate is now at a record high. So if the UK keeps creating jobs, that could tip the BoE into pressing the button on a rate hike. Analysts from Morgan Stanley say, in a new research note: If employment growth continues at the current robust rate (0.6%Q, +181k), and is accompanied by 3Q growth above the BoE staff projection of 0.3%Q, then we would now expect the MPC to hike at the November 2 Inflation Report meeting. But at the moment, we forecast a deceleration in employment growth as a lagged effect of this year\u2019s slowdown in growth, which we think should be enough to keep the MPC on hold. They also provide this graph, showing how real wages (green) have started shrinking as inflation (yellow) has risen. By sounding so hawkish today, the Bank of England has managed to strengthen the pound without actually having to raise interest rates. Talking a currency up, or down \u2013 depending if you want to get inflation higher or lower \u2013 is a key central bank tactic these days. Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, predicts that the BoE will be pleased to see the market reaction to today\u2019s announcement. But she suspects interest rates won\u2019t rise until mid-2018. \u201cMany will understandably now think that a rate rise in imminent, but in fact our view is that it is more likely to be next summer. This is because the MPC is still dominated by doves, such as Mark Carney, who are concerned about the impact higher rates could have on real wages so dependent on consumer spending. \u201cOf course, the risks could change, particularly if sterling were to devalue further, but for now the Bank\u2019s rhetoric appears to have done its job.\u201d The price of short-dated UK government debt has fallen since the Bank of England\u2019s announcement, pushing up the interest rate (or yield) on the debt. That\u2019s another sign that the City is expecting the Bank of England to withdraw some stimulus, perhaps in November. Craig Inches, Head of Short Rates and Cash at Royal London Asset Management, says The sell-off on Thursday was particularly pronounced among shorter dated gilts, more sensitive to forthcoming changes in interest rates, where two year yields hit a new high for this year and rocketed ever closer to pre-referendum levels. \u201cIn our view, although the die is not quite cast on raising rates just yet, any policy decisions which move government bond yields back towards more normal levels are a welcome return towards bond markets which look more connected to economic fundamentals.\u201d People have been queuing outside the Bank of England this morning, to get their hands on the first new \u00a310 notes, featuring Jane Austen. Caroline Criado-Perez, who led a campaign to have more women on Britain\u2019s banknotes, has said she\u2019ll donate her first Jane Austen tenner to a local women\u2019s shelter. Despite the pound\u2019s rally, some City experts aren\u2019t convinced that interest rates will really rise this autumn, as the Bank of England is hinting. There\u2019s a good argument that the UK economy isn\u2019t ready for higher borrowing costs, given wage growth is weak, as it enters the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says the BoE is likely to tread very cautiously. She writes: The meagre wage growth we are seeing in spite of these trends is making it harder for the Bank of England to raise rates, especially as any rise will put yet more pressure on households who are already under strain due to a fall in their real earnings. The surge in sterling is hurting share prices in London. The FTSE 100 has shed 76 points, or 1%. That\u2019s partly because a stronger pound will cut the value of exporters\u2019 earnings. Housebuilders are also among the fallers, with traders calculating that higher interest rates could hurt demand for new property. My colleague Richard Partington has analysed the minutes of today\u2019s Bank of England, and writes: The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.25% amid sluggish pay growth and a squeeze on household spending, while hinting that a rise may come sooner than expected. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee was split, with Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty calling for an immediate rise to 0.5% to keep rising inflation in check. City economists had expected a vote of 7-2 to hold the rate steady. The Bank\u2019s decision comes amid \u201cconsiderable risks\u201d to the economy from the Brexit process, as households, businesses and the financial markets respond to the vote to leave the European Union. \u201cThe circumstances since the referendum on EU membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, have been exceptional,\u201d the MPC said. However, with signs of a strengthening economy, Threadneedle Street said \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months in order to return inflation sustainably to target\u201d, according to minutes of the MPC meeting. Although the MPC opted to keep rates on hold, Threadneedle Street noted GDP had risen by 0.3% in the three months to June while unemployment has fallen to 4.3%, its lowest level in more than 40 years. This could lead to a rate rise sooner than anticipated by financial markets, should inflation continue to rise and the economy continue to perform well. The Bank said any increase would come at a gradual and limited pace.... Here\u2019s the full story: Speculation of a November interest rate hike has just pushed sterling up to a new one-year high against the US dollar. One pound is now worth $1.3337, the highest level since September 2016, having gained more than a cent today. This means sterling has recovered around half its losses in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, but it still worth around 11% than in June 2016. A November rate hike is a \u201creal possibility\u201d, agrees Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She writes: The Bank of England may have left rates on hold and the vote split may have stayed at 7-2, however, the tone of the statement was definitely more hawkish, and the prospect of a November rate hike is now a real possibility, in our view.... We tend to assume that the BOE will make any major move at a meeting when the Governor presents the Inflation Report, which leaves November or February. Surely, if inflation is rising and the labour market continues to create jobs at its current clip then November could be key? Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that the Bank of England has waited to long to raise interest rates. He argues: \u201cThe challenge facing the MPC is to deliver a gradual increase in interest rates which can be absorbed by the economy. By continually delaying the first move in this direction, there is an increasing risk that when interest rates do start to rise, it will take consumers and borrowers by surprise - and therefore create a bigger shock to the economy than it needs to be.\u201d The City now reckons there is a 42% chance that the Bank of England raises interest rates in November. Plus, the possibility of a rate hike by December has risen to 54%. (thanks to Michael Hewson of CMC Markets for the chart) Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, is sceptical that the Bank of England will actually raise interest rates soon. He believes that the UK economy will struggle this autumn: In our view, growth is likely to disappoint in the months ahead... [and] the track ahead presents obstacles on the political front. Theresa May is likely to reinforce her Brexit credentials in her speech next Friday and at the Conservative Party Conference, so let\u2019s not get too carried away with the current rally. The pound has now jumped back over $1.33, close to yesterday\u2019s one-year high, as chatter of a November interest rate hike builds. UK interest rates could be raised in just two months time, says Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. Hollingsworth says that the Bank of England\u2019s hawkish words today (see here) may pave the way for a November hike. He writes: The minutes struck a considerably more hawkish tone than in August in suggesting that \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months\u201d. Indeed, this supports our long-held view that market expectations had gone way too far in expecting rates to remain on hold until 2019. If the economy continues to hold up, and there are clearer signs that wage growth is building, then the first hike could some somewhat earlier than we had previously envisaged, possibly as soon as the next meeting in November alongside the Inflation Report. David Robinson of MNI says the BoE has moved closer to raising interest rates, but remains split over the timing. Chris Giles of the Financial Times says a rate hike could come in November, if the Bank of England actually delivers on its words.... James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal suspects the pound has over-reacted. But right now, the MPC\u2019s two hawks look a little lonely.... Boom! The Bank of England is warning that interest rates are likely to rise faster than the City expects. The minutes of this week\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting state that: All MPC members continued to judge that, if the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than current market expectations. They add that a majority of MPC members believe \u201csome withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months.\u201d That\u2019s a clear signal to investors that the Bank is getting an itchy trigger finger. The pound has jumped three quarters of a cent in reaction, up to $1.329 against the US dollar. Now this is interesting. The Bank of England says the UK economy is looking a little more robust than expected. It says: Since the August Report, the relatively limited news on activity points, if anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated. GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter, as expected in the MPC\u2019s August projections, although initial estimates of private final demand were softer than anticipated. The unemployment rate has continued to decline, to 4.3%, its lowest in over 40 years and a little lower than forecast in August. The BoE has also left its asset purchase scheme, QE, unchanged: Two policymakers, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, broke ranks again and voted to raise borrowing costs to 0.5% to tackle inflation. However, the other seven members of the MPC were unconvinced. Breaking! The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.25%. More to follow Tension is mounting in the City as traders prepare for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision, at noon precisely. Although the Monetary Policy Committee will probably leave rates on hold, the big question is whether it is split, again. In particular, whether chief economist Andy Haldane changes his vote and pushes for a hike. On a brighter note, John Lewis did export more to the rest of the world last year. Today\u2019s statement days: Overseas, we export Waitrose products to 58 countries, and sales were up 9.1%, achieved through additional volume with existing customers. John Lewis\u2019s problems illustrate the dilemma facing the Bank of England today as it decides whether to leave UK interest rates unchanged. The fall in the pound has pushed up John Lewis\u2019s costs, by making imports pricier. Ideally, it would pass this onto consumers, protecting its market share. But people are already squeezed by falling real wages, so the company clearly feels price hikes would be counterproductive, and simply drive shoppers from the aisles. Jon Copestake, chief retail and consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says other retailers face the same challenge. Caught between the rock of rising costs and the hard place of increased price consciousness among consumers the retailer has been faced with the difficult choice between passing costs onto shoppers or absorbing those costs and seeing lower profit margins. In this case the latter course has largely been chosen, but on doing so revenues have exhibited steady growth while profits have halved. So the Bank of England policymakers face a similar tricky decision - do they leave interest rates on hold and allow inflation to keep rising, or raise rates costs and squeeze borrowers. Joshua Mahony of IG sums it up: With real incomes falling, the BoE must decide whether it is preferable to raise rates in an effort to strengthen the pound (and reduce inflation), or whether to remain accommodative to help push up wages. Here\u2019s a copy of the letter which Theresa May will receive from the Northern Rock small shareholders group today: In other news, a group of pensioners are heading to Downing Street to demand compensation over the collapse of Northern Rock a decade ago. The N Rock Small Shareholder Action Group are seeing redress for the 150,000 small shareholders who were wiped out after Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2009, as the financial crisis grew. The Action Group claim that the Labour government \u2018stole\u2019 Northern Rock\u2019s valuable assets, and wants Theresa May to examine their case. Chairman of the Action Group, Dennis Grainger, will hand a letter over at 10 Downing Street this afternoon. He says: \u201cThree times I tried to get a meeting with David Cameron to ask him to review the unfair handling by the previous disingenuous administration. Now may be an appropriate time for the Prime Minister to apply the \u2018fairness\u2019 in which she clearly believes.\u201d It\u2019s exactly 10 years since queues formed outside Northern Rock after the bank was forced to seek help from the Bank of England. A twitter account called @TBTFLive is reliving the crisis.... Guy Ellison, Head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investments, says John Lewis is struggling because it simply cannot pass on its rising costs to consumers. Ellison says: \u201cThe news that John Lewis\u2019 profits have fallen by more than 50% is a clear indication of the scale of the restructuring task it faces. The underlying profit numbers, which are down 5%, are more indicative of the current state of affairs at the company whereby cost of goods have gone up as result of a weakening pound and which can\u2019t be fully passed on to an already stretched consumer, who has seen the cost of living rise faster than wages. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital argues that the company needs to up its game. The boss of fashion giant Next has offered some comfort for cash-strapped consumer. Lord Wolfson has predicted that the worst of the Brexit-fuelled price hikes on the high street are over: PA has the details: Chief executive Lord Wolfson told the Press Association the impact of the Brexit vote on the pound \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s fuelling an inflationary spiral and is passing right through\u201d. Shoppers must hope he\u2019s right. UK clothing and footwear prices jumped at a record rate in August, according to Tuesday\u2019s inflation data. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, suspects that John Lewis will be forced to pass rising import costs onto consumers. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that John Lewis have seen a fall in consumer demand, but to take more than a 50% hit to their profits is pretty worrying. It\u2019s good of John Lewis to not pass on all these rising costs to consumers, but I do wonder how long they will be able to soak them up for. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming evident that shoppers are tightening their purse strings and saving where they can. The rise of the cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl could mean that people are looking for a bargain whenever they can and only using the likes of Waitrose for more luxury items.\u201d ITV\u2019s Chris Choi tweets: Here\u2019s my colleague Angela Monaghan on John Lewis\u2019s financial results: John Lewis has said its profits more than halved in the first six months and warned that weaker consumer demand caused by Brexit uncertainty and rising prices will hit the business in the remainder of the year. The group, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as the John Lewis department store chain, said it was operating in a tough retail market as UK consumers were less willing to spend money against a backdrop of higher inflation and political uncertainty. John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the retailer had not passed on to shoppers the full extent of its own rising costs \u201cNobody should be surprised that this is a tough market for retailers. There\u2019s any number of reasons for that,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThe reason our profits are down is predominantly because of margin, and cost prices are rising. It\u2019s a very competitive market, retail prices are not rising as fast.\u201d Pre-tax profit at the group fell 53% in the first six months of the year, to \u00a326.6m. When redundancy and restructuring costs were stripped out, pre-tax profit was down almost 5% at \u00a383m as higher costs ate into margins. Group sales rose by 2.3% over the period, to \u00a35.4bn. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s some social media reaction to John Lewis\u2019s drop in profits: (That\u2019s Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss who resigned last year to (successfully) run for Mayor of the West Midlands). John Lewis says its profits have suffered because it has only passed on \u201cvery few\u201d of its higher costs onto consumers. One shopper doesn\u2019t agree..... City analyst Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: John Lewis issued a pretty stark warning this morning, stating that \u2018Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question\u2019, after its profits fell a stomach-churning 53%. Retail expert Nick Bubb adds that John Lewis is \u201cless bullish\u201d than Next about its prospects. He also points out that JL\u2019s profits were hit by \u00a353m of restructuring costs (including redundancy payouts). John Lewis has also warned that high inflation and political uncertainty will continue to eat into profits. Looking forward to 2018, the company says: We are well set for our all-important seasonal peak, but expect the headwinds that have dampened consumer demand and put pressure on margins to continue into next year. Our full year profits will depend, as they always do, on the final quarter which typically accounts for well over half of our profits before exceptional items. We expect margin pressure to continue into the second half year and we will incur higher pension accounting charges, as a result of low market interest rates at the start of the year. These will impact our overall profits. Newsflash: The Swiss central bank has left interest rates in Switzerland at their current record low of minus 0.75%, and pledged to defend its position in the foreign exchange markets if necessary. Switzerland is imposing negative rates to prevent the Swiss franc rising too high against other currencies, and hurting its economy. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: While John Lewis struggles, fellow retailer Next has cheered the City this morning. Next has \u201cmodestly\u201d upgraded its sales and profit guidance for this year, after finding that 2017 hasn\u2019t been quite as tough as it feared. Chief executive Simon Wolfson explains: The first half of the year has been difficult and sales and profits are in line with our cautious expectations. However, our performance in the last three months has been encouraging on a number of fronts and whilst the retail environment remains tough, our prospects going forward appear somewhat less challenging than they did six months ago. Given Wolfson\u2019s previous comments, this is stirring stuff! Last year, for example, he said business felt like \u201cwalking up the down escalator\u201d. Indeed, the Financial Times says Wolfson is \u201cpractically giving it the jazz hands\u201d. Share have jumped by 8% in early trading, as investors hope that Next is turning a corner. But...today\u2019s figures do confirm that British retail is struggling. Next\u2019s pre-tax profits are down by almost 10% this year, including a 33% tumble in earning at its Retail arm (shops, rather than its Directory operation). John Lewis\u2019s chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, says Britain needs a \u201cserious parliamentary debate\u201d on Brexit, having seen his company\u2019s profits slide this year. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future is damaging consumer confidence, and hurting businesses. As Mayfield put it: We should be under no illusions. Brexit is having an effect on the economy, no question. It\u2019s the same for everybody, and the main effects are sterling and confidence. John Lewis has sent a shiver through the retail sector this morning, by revealing that its earnings have more than halved in the first half of this year. Pretax profits across the group - seen as a bellwether for middle class households - fell by 53% in the last six months, to \u00a326.9m. John Lewis blamed the surge in costs since the pound slumped last year, saying: The first half of this year has seen inflationary pressures driven by exchange rates and political uncertainty. These have dampened customer demand, especially in categories connected to the housing market. Like-for-like sales at John Lewis\u2019s department stores only rose by 0.1%, while its Waitrose supermarket chain grew sales by 0.7%. But a range of one-off items, including an \u201cexceptional charge\u201d of \u00a356m for restructuring and redundancy costs, hit its bottom line. This chart has the details: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England Day! Britain\u2019s central bank finds itself on the horns of a painful dilemma today, as policymakers meet to set interest rates. Already this week, the BoE has seen inflation spike back to 2.9%, a four-year high, increasing the pressure to raise borrowing costs. But that was swiftly followed by yesterday\u2019s depressing earnings figures, showing that wage growth remained sluggish at 2.1%. With real wages still falling, British households trapped in a cost of living squeeze, and Brexit uncertainty still clouding the economy, can the Bank really hike interest rates today? The City thinks not; economists expect rates to remain at their record low of 0.25%. But at least two policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee are likely to vote for a rate hike. There\u2019s even a chance that Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty could be joined by a third hawk, chief economist Andy Haldane. It seems likely that the Bank will warn that it can\u2019t tolerate higher inflation for ever. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s analysts say: Following news of the faster-than-expected rise in CPI inflation this week to 2.9% y/y, and the already flagged limited tolerance for above-target inflation, it seems likely that the meeting minutes will have a hawkish tinge to them. Given that this was also followed by news that average earnings growth stagnated at 2.1% 3m/y, concerns about the limited scope for consumer spending momentum could balance out the upside news on inflation. So all eyes will be on the Bank of England at noon today. On a lighter note, the Bank is also launching its new \u00a310 note - featuring Jane Austen. There\u2019s also a flurry of UK company news this morning, with John Lewis, Next and Morrisons all reporting results. At first glance they look mixed, with John Lewis reporting falling profits but Morrisons saying its turnaround plan is working.... More to follow. European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, wit the FTSE 100 called down 0.1%.

    "webTitle": "John Lewis profits halve as chairman warns over Brexit uncertainty", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "John Lewis profits have more than halved amid rising prices and weaker consumer demand prompted by Brexit. In an update for the first six months of its financial year, the group, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as the John Lewis department store chain, said it expected the tough retail climate to continue throughout this year as UK consumers were less willing to spend money against a backdrop of higher inflation and political uncertainty. As the government prepares for a fourth round of Brexit negotiations with the EU, the John Lewis chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said uncertainty was being throughout the economy and a \u201cserious\u201d parliamentary debate about Brexit was now essential. \u201cBrexit is having an impact on everybody. Sterling is weaker and there is evidence to show that confidence is being affected. The issues related to leaving the EU are extremely complicated and we do want to see justice being done to that complexity. There needs to be serious parliamentary debate. \u201cThere is a very complex negotiation before us and the core principles of that need to be thrashed out in order to increase the chances of a successful conclusion to the negotiation. If not there is a greater risk of a disorderly outcome.\u201d Mayfield\u2019s warning came as he unveiled pre-tax profit at the John Lewis group had slumped 53% in the six months to the end of July, to \u00a326.6m. Much of the damage to the bottom line was due to \u00a356m of redundancy and restructuring costs designed to improve productivity and accommodate the increasing demand for online shopping. When these one-off costs were stripped out, pre-tax profit was down almost 5% at \u00a383m as higher costs ate into margins. Group sales rose by 2.3% over the period, to \u00a35.4bn. The department stores performed better than the Waitrose supermarket side of the group. Underlying profits increased 9.7% at the John Lewis stores to nearly \u00a340m, while Waitrose profits fell 17.4% to \u00a3101m as costs rose three times faster than a 1.5% rise in prices. Waitrose boss Rob Collins said inflation in meat, fish and dairy had been very strong. Mayfield said the retailer had not passed on to shoppers the full extent of its own rising costs resulting from the fall in the value of sterling. \u201cWe are not expecting these headwinds to diminish.\u201d he said. Aside from the cost of restructuring at John Lewis, Mayfield said profits had predominantly been affected by a squeeze on margins as tough competition was forcing the company to keep prices down despite rising costs. But it was a different story at Morrisons, where bosses said they had kept profit margins steady despite cost inflation by increasing sales and improving efficiency in its supply chain, much of which is managed in house. Underlying pretax profits at the recovering retail group rose 12.7% to \u00a3177m as sales rose 4.8% to \u00a38.4bn. The chief executive, David Potts, said the retailer\u2019s set-up, with two-thirds of its products sourced in the UK and much of its meat fish and vegetables processed in-house, meant the company \u201cshould be giving it your best shot to be holding inflation down for customers\u201d. He said it was not possible to \u201cdefy gravity\u201d on some products, such as butter and cream, where inflation had been very heady. But new avenues of distribution for Morrisons products, including selling Safeway-branded goods to the McColl\u2019s convenience store chain from next year, supplying Amazon with groceries and a tie-up with petrol forecourt operator Rontec would all help boost productivity and margins despite rising inflation. Mayfield said sales were rising so far in the second half, but warned that a number of factors would weigh on profits. \u201cSales growth has continued in the first few weeks of the second half. We are well set for our all-important seasonal peak, but we expect the headwinds that have dampened consumer demand and put pressure on margins to continue into next year,\u201d he said. In March, when John Lewis announced full-year results for 2016, the bonus for staff was cut to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s and down from 10% the year before. Mayfield said the second half of the year would be crucial to determining the staff bonus for next year, because the business makes two-thirds of profits during the latter half.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> profits have more than halved amid rising prices and weaker consumer demand prompted by Brexit.</p> <p>In an update for the first six months of its financial year, the group, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as the John Lewis department store chain, said it expected the tough retail climate to continue throughout this year as UK consumers were less willing to spend money against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/12/uk-cost-of-living-rise-imports-boost-inflation-interest-rates\">higher inflation</a> and political uncertainty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/theresa-may-to-deliver-brexit-speech-in-florence\">As the government prepares for a fourth round of Brexit negotiations with the EU</a>, the John Lewis chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said uncertainty was being throughout the economy and a \u201cserious\u201d parliamentary debate about Brexit was now essential.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit is having an impact on everybody. Sterling is weaker and there is evidence to show that confidence is being affected. The issues related to leaving the EU are extremely complicated and we do want to see justice being done to that complexity. There needs to be serious parliamentary debate.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very complex negotiation before us and the core principles of that need to be thrashed out in order to increase the chances of a successful conclusion to the negotiation. If not there is a greater risk of a disorderly outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Mayfield\u2019s warning came as he unveiled pre-tax profit at the John Lewis group had slumped 53% in the six months to the end of July, to \u00a326.6m.</p> <p>Much of the damage to the bottom line was due to \u00a356m of redundancy and restructuring costs designed to improve productivity and accommodate the increasing demand for online shopping. When these one-off costs were stripped out, pre-tax profit was down almost 5% at \u00a383m as higher costs ate into margins. Group sales rose by 2.3% over the period, to \u00a35.4bn.</p> <p>The department stores performed better than the Waitrose supermarket side of the group. Underlying profits increased 9.7% at the John Lewis stores to nearly \u00a340m, while Waitrose profits fell 17.4% to \u00a3101m as costs rose three times faster than a 1.5% rise in prices. Waitrose boss Rob Collins said inflation in meat, fish and dairy had been very strong.</p> <p>Mayfield said the retailer had not passed on to shoppers the full extent of its own rising costs resulting from the fall in the value of sterling. \u201cWe are not expecting these headwinds to diminish.\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/next-morrisons-brexit-price-rises-weak-pound\">Next and Morrisons predict end to Brexit-related price rises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aside from the cost of restructuring at John Lewis, Mayfield said profits had predominantly been affected by a squeeze on margins as tough competition was forcing the company to keep prices down despite rising costs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/14/next-morrisons-brexit-price-rises-weak-pound\">But it was a different story at Morrisons, </a>where bosses said they had kept profit margins steady despite cost inflation by increasing sales and improving efficiency in its supply chain, much of which is managed in house.</p> <p>Underlying pretax profits at the recovering retail group rose 12.7% to \u00a3177m as sales rose 4.8% to \u00a38.4bn.</p> <p>The chief executive, David Potts, said the retailer\u2019s set-up, with two-thirds of its products sourced in the UK and much of its meat fish and vegetables processed in-house, meant the company \u201cshould be giving it your best shot to be holding inflation down for customers\u201d.</p> <p>He said it was not possible to \u201cdefy gravity\u201d on some products, such as butter and cream, where inflation had been very heady. But new avenues of distribution for Morrisons products, including selling Safeway-branded goods to the McColl\u2019s convenience store chain from next year, supplying Amazon with groceries and a tie-up with petrol forecourt operator Rontec would all help boost productivity and margins despite rising inflation.</p> <p> </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/11/london-financial-centre-brexit-frankfurt-dublin-new-york-donald-trump\">London still world's top financial centre despite Brexit, says survey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mayfield said sales were rising so far in the second half, but warned that a number of factors would weigh on profits.</p> <p>\u201cSales growth has continued in the first few weeks of the second half. We are well set for our all-important seasonal peak, but we expect the headwinds that have dampened consumer demand and put pressure on margins to continue into next year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In March, when John Lewis announced full-year results for 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/john-lewis-staff-bonus-6-profits\">the bonus for staff was cut to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s</a> and down from 10% the year before. Mayfield said the second half of the year would be crucial to determining the staff bonus for next year, because the business makes two-thirds of profits during the latter half.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs on two parliamentary select committees have challenged Sports Direct over claims it is deliberately under-paying couriers by mislabeling heavy items, including bicycles, as lightweight packets to avoid paying the fair delivery cost. Frank Field, Labour MP and chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said he had written to Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, to demand answers following concerns raised by a whistleblower at delivery company Hermes. Hermes \u201ccategorically\u201d denied the allegations, saying: \u201cWe have stringent processes in place to check that parcels are not mislabelled and placed in the wrong weight category.\u201d Field said: \u201cIn the last parliament we heard egregious examples of companies using an essentially bogus classification of self-employment to shirk their responsibilities to those who work for them. \u201cIf this complaint stands up, it represents a new low in actually deliberately under-paying workers for the work they do. We look forward to a speedy response and if there is merit in these claims, an immediate change in working practices and proper compensation for workers who have been subjected to this.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and chair-elect of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said it appeared there could be a \u201cstitch-up between Hermes and Sports Direct to short-change low-paid couriers in order to boost company profits\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply concerning to hear reports that the paying of couriers at an artificially low rate could be a persistent practice in arrangements between these two companies,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t rely on company boards and shareholders to stop these sorts of unethical practices, then tougher enforcement measures will need to be considered by the government and parliament.\u201d Field, who has led campaigns in parliament against what he claims is the \u201csulphurous effect\u201d of the fast-growing gig economy, said the whistleblower claimed that Sports Direct was the most persistent company in mislabelling delivery items. Last year MPs accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse following a Guardian undercover investigation of conditions at its Shirebrook facility. Sports Direct is alleged to regularly dispatch heavy parcels to Hermes drivers labelled as \u201cpackets\u201d, a classification meant for small items that weigh less than a kilogram. In recent examples, the whistleblower alleged, a bicycle and a parcel weighing over 10kg were sent as packets. The whistleblower claimed Sport Direct \u201calmost always sends parcels through as packets\u201d. Hermes pays its drivers a higher rate for heavier items, which are classified as parcels. Field said that rates on Hermes\u2019 website suggest that labelling a 10kg parcel as a \u201cpacket\u201d rather than a \u201cparcel\u201d would save the company \u00a37.20. Hermes said: \u201cWe categorically deny these allegations and are happy to answer any questions raised. We have stringent processes in place to check that parcels are not mislabelled and placed in the wrong weight category. \u201cOn the rare occasion of an individual label being incorrect, couriers can immediately call our dedicated courier support team, to notify us and change their payment with no questions asked. This applies to all our clients and ensures that both Hermes and our couriers receive the correct payment. We have no issues with Sports Direct who remain a valued customer. \u201cThis year we have invested heavily in pay increases for our couriers, who now get paid a minimum of \u00a38.50 per hour and an average of \u00a311 per hour after expenses.\u201d Sports Direct did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Weronika Nowaczynska is reluctant to touch the new \u00a310 note. As a vegan she objects to the fact the polymer banknotes were made using the animal byproduct tallow. She works at Redemption, a vegan restaurant on Old Street in London, where some customers had already expressed unease about the new plastic fivers, introduced last year, which are made the same way. After the bank issued the new \u00a35 note, one the Rainbow cafe in Cambridgerefused to accept them. It has not said whether it will accept the new tenners. Nowaczynska, who is from Poland, sympathises. \u201cIf it was up to me I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially in a vegan restaurant, but what can you do? You can\u2019t turn money away.\u201d At least two of her customers have refused the new \u00a35 notes as change, insisting on coins instead, she said. \u201cFrom a design point of view it looks pretty nice, and I like Jane Austen. But that\u2019s not really the point. They should have found a different way to make them that doesn\u2019t use animal fat.\u201d The Bank of England decided to stick with its production process for plastic banknotes despite complaints from vegans and religious groups. It said that after \u201ccareful and serious consideration and extensive public consultation\u201d switching to palm oil alternatives would be costly and raise questions about environmental sustainability. Nowaczynska is not convinced. \u201cI am not sure whether you can trust they have done everything they can to avoid using animal fat,\u201d she said. Baris Danisan, the Kurdish owner of Barry\u2019s Food and Wine in Hoxton, has no such qualms. He is proud that the cash machine outside his shop was one of the first chosen to distribute the new notes. He attached a homemade sticker to the ATM boasting: \u201cPolymer \u00a310 note ready.\u201d Danisan is a collector of old banknotes. He draws a sample from under his till that includes old tenners and fivers and an old \u00a31 note. It also includes one of the first plastic fivers to run off the presses, featuring a sought-after serial number beginning AA01. \u201cYou can get on them eBay for \u00a325, but this is not for sale,\u201d he said. As it came out of the machine outside his shop, Danisan wants to keep it to show his children. \u201cI\u2019m just lucky they chose this store. I\u2019ve collected notes from a young age, just for fun, not for money.\u201d The Queen was to be presented with the first new tenner, with serial number AA01 000001. Prince Philip was to get the second and Theresa May the third. Collectors are on the hunt for very low serial numbers after the lowest-number \u00a35 note issued to the public, AA01000017, sold for \u00a34,105 at a charity auction last year. This time the first tenners to emerge from the cash machine outside Barry\u2019s Food and Wine didn\u2019t have collectable serial numbers. Danisan looks down at the notes with some disdain. \u201cI won\u2019t be collecting those because they haven\u2019t got AAs on them.\u201d He holds out hope, however, that there could be serial number treasures hiding in the machine. \u201cMaybe the bottom set is different,\u201d he said. Danisan has had to reassure some customers in his shop that the new notes are not forgeries. \u201cIt looks different from the old one,\u201d said Dominik, a Polish builder, after withdrawing a handful of new tenners from the machine. Asked if he wa a fan of Jane Austen, who features on the note, Dominik said: \u201c I don\u2019t know her.\u201d Pointing to the picture of the Queen on the other side of the note, he said: \u201cI only know this one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One sympathises, of course, with the former shareholders in Northern Rock who are still campaigning for compensation a decade after the bank\u2019s nationalisation. They are not faceless City institutions. Many are small shareholders who had invested substantial sums, presumably in the belief the Rock was a solid north-east institution run by a competent board, and lost the lot. The problem with the compensation idea, however, is that it doesn\u2019t stand up. Yes, it is probably true that the Rock was not insolvent, just suffering an extreme liquidity crisis. After all, the Treasury is set to make a clear profit from the run-off of the mortgage book. But those profits are not evidence of unfair confiscation. Taxpayers assumed a risk the Rock was unable to bear because it had been running a risky and reckless funding model that couldn\u2019t withstand the crisis. For a bank, lack of liquidity can be a life-threatening event. Regulators at the Financial Services Authority were asleep, but that doesn\u2019t alter the compensation argument. If the Rock had fallen into administration rather than being nationalised after a fruitless search for a buyer, shareholders would almost certainly have been wiped out anyway. The independent expert decided zero compensation was due and his judgment was upheld on appeal. The campaigners\u2019 other point is that the owners of Royal Bank of Scotland were treated less harshly. Again, that is factually correct, but so what? Taxpayers took 89% control of RBS, rather than 100%, because the Treasury wanted to maintain a stock market listing and keep the bank subject to outside pressures. With hindsight, that decision was probably a mistake, but it doesn\u2019t imply the Rock had to be treated the same way. Sadly, the chance of the campaigners securing compensation through moral suasion is extremely low. Indeed, it is about as likely as the former Rock chairman Matt Ridley, now Viscount Ridley, treating readers of his Times column to his 10th-anniversary thoughts on what went so spectacularly wrong in the boardroom. We\u2019re still waiting for that important piece. \u2018Drama\u2019 on Threadneedle Street At last, drama at the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2026 or rather the promise of it. The majority for doing nothing immediately on interest rates was a same-again at 7-2, but the seven would like to you know they\u2019re jolly serious about changing their vote one of these days. They even put a date on the possible big moment \u2013 November, alongside the Bank\u2019s next quarterly inflation report. The warning that rates could rise sooner than expected is plainly more forceful than previous limp hints. It would also be odd if the Bank wasn\u2019t contemplating action. Inflation last month was 2.9% and has been above the 2% target since February. The jobless rate stands at a 42-year low, even if increases in wages have been feeble, and economic progress since August paints a slightly stronger picture than anticipated, say the minutes. What we don\u2019t know, obviously, is what would qualify as a sufficient surprise to keep the Bank on pause. A fall in inflation to, say, 2.6%? A bad jobs report? Softer wage growth? All are possibilities. Both outcomes are plainly possible in November, but you can\u2019t blame the doubters for concluding they\u2019ll believe the rate rise when they see it. The Bank has conducted a long dance, and it\u2019s a maestro at stretching things out. Next feels more confident Judge Simon Wolfson\u2019s mood by his willingness to run share buybacks. Next\u2019s chief executive turned them off in March because there was too much uncertainty in the air. Now he\u2019s turning them on again. He\u2019s feeling more confident, thus a modest 1% tickle to his profit forecast for the year provoked a 13% rise in the share price. Fair enough. Another reason for investors\u2019 enthusiasm may be the fact Wolfson gives them useful information, in this case an analysis of the effect of the rise of internet shopping. Next\u2019s stores would generate \u00a31bn of cash over a decade even on the gloomy assumption that their like-for-like sales declined by 6% every year. That, in large part, is because of the flexibility offered by leases with relatively short durations. Such analyses should be compulsory for mature retailers. Could the supermarkets and Marks &amp; Spencer offer the same comfort? Even if they can\u2019t, investors deserve to see the arithmetic.",

O\u2019Leary said the Irish firm was finalising the details of a deal that would be just the second major acquisition in the no-frills airline\u2019s 33-year history. Alitalia\u2019s brand and long-haul operations would survive the takeover but Ryanair, which prefers to own its aircraft, would jettison Alitalia\u2019s model of leasing planes. \u201cWe would have to order new planes, whether Boeing or Airbus,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. He said he hoped any deal would see Alitalia pilots and crew keep their jobs, but signalled that they would have to accept altered employment terms in line with Ryanair\u2019s own. Alitalia was put up for sale earlier this year after the Italian government finally approved its collapse into administration, having pumped nearly \u00a36bn into the company over a decade. It followed a vote by employees to reject a rescue plan, which would have seen wages slashed in return for a further \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) injection from shareholders, including Etihad, the Gulf airline, which owns 49%. Air Berlin is also on the block but O\u2019Leary said he had no interest in making a bid, repeating previous accusations that it was a stitch-up designed to make Lufthansa stronger. He said he expected EU competition authorities would demand substantial remedies in the event Lufthansa buys Air Berlin, with the carrier likely to have to give up slots on routes within Germany to preserve competition. If the Alitalia deal proceeds, it would be Ryanair\u2019s first successful takeover since it bought its rival Buzz from KLM in 2003. Ryanair was blocked by the European Union from acquiring Aer Lingus in 2013 after three failed attempts at swallowing its Irish compatriot.",

      "bodyText": "Former shareholders in Northern Rock are asking Theresa May to listen to their moral case for compensation after their investment in the Newcastle-based lender was wiped out when it was nationalised 10 years ago. A delegation of investors will arrive at 10 Downing Street on Thursday to hand in a letter to the prime minister to set out their claim that it is unfair that the government has received all of the proceeds from sales of Northern Rock\u2019s assets. Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of the run on Northern Rock, when nervous customers seeking to withdraw their money queued at branches around the country after news broke that the bank had received emergency funding from the Bank of England. Dennis Grainger, who worked at Northern Rock for 10 years, has led the campaign and will head the delegation to argue that there is justification to make payments to about 150,000 private shareholders who lost their equity when the bank was nationalised in February 2008. Grainger said: \u201cThree times I tried to get a meeting with David Cameron to ask him to review the unfair handling by the previous disingenuous administration. Now may be an appropriate time for the prime minister to apply the \u2018fairness\u2019 in which she clearly believes.\u201d The group he leads has continue to work on their claim despite a decision by the European court of justice in 2012 to dismiss their argument that they were entitled to a payout. Part of Northern Rock was sold to Virgin Money in 2012 and since then other mortgages have been sold off and parts of the business managed alongside the mortgage book of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The government has estimated it will make about \u00a39.6bn from Northern Rock and the parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley with which it has been combined, the campaigners said. The former shareholders argue that have an \u201coverwhelming case that the entire Rock handling and outcome clearly demonstrates discriminatory treatment, injustice and unfairness toward the shareholders who were \u2018wiped out\u2019 unjustly\u201d. Among their arguments is that the shareholders in banks that were rescued the following year \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TBS and HBOS \u2013 were not wiped out in the same way. In his letter to the prime minister, on behalf of the Northern Rock Small Shareholders Association, Grainger said: \u201cAs the UK marks the 10th anniversary of the Northern Rock crisis in 2007 may we suggest to you that it would be appropriate now to try and achieve a just closure on an equitable, morally sound and fair basis.\u201d The run on Northern Rock began on 14 September 2007 after the BBC reported that the Newcastle-based lender had received emergency funding from the Bank of England. It was the first run on a high street bank in the UK since Overend &amp; Gurney in the 1860s.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The group behind the Londis and Budgens convenience store chains says tobacco sales have plunged since new rules came into force which mean cigarettes must be sold in standardised packaging bearing graphic warnings of the dangers of smoking. Booker, the cash and carry group which has agreed to a \u00a33.7bn takeover by Tesco, said tobacco sales had fallen nearly 10% in its second quarter. The fall in demand for cigarettes weighed on overall sales, which grew by 1.1% in the 12 weeks to 8 September. Stripping out tobacco, sales were up almost 6% over the period. \u201cTobacco sales continued to be adversely impacted by changes in tobacco legislation,\u201d Booker said in its second-quarter trading update. Under EU rules that came into force in May, all cigarette packs must contain at least 20 cigarettes to make sure they are big enough to display health warnings covering 65% of the front and back. The brand name is restricted to a standard size, font and colour. The measures are designed to prevent young people taking up the habit, and to cut the number of smokers across the EU by 2.4 million. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health, welcomed the fall in cigarette sales and said it was a sign of the diminishing importance of tobacco to retailers. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent news that this large wholesaler is reporting such a substantial fall in tobacco sales,\u201d Arnott said. \u201cWhile it will be many years before we see the full impact of plain packaging policy today\u2019s results show that removing glitzy visual tobacco branding and focusing on the disastrous health impacts of smoking has been an important public health measure.\u201d Booker agreed in January to a \u00a33.7bn takeover by Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain. The proposed deal is currently the subject of an in-depth investigation, after the competition watchdog said it could result in higher prices for shoppers in about 350 areas across the UK. As well as supplying convenience chains including Premier, Budgens and Londis, Booker operates the Makro cash and carry business. It also serves numerous high street restaurant chains, such as Carluccio\u2019s, Wagamama, Byron and Prezzo, a growing part of the market that Tesco wants to tap. Marks &amp; Spencer, most of the cinema chains in the UK, and the prison service in England and Wales are all counted among the group\u2019s customers. The Competition and Markets Authority is expected to make a final decision on the deal by Christmas. \u201cBooker Group continues to make good progress,\u201d said Charles Wilson, the chief executive, commenting alongside the trading update. \u201cThe competition review of the planned merger with Tesco is progressing. We continue to help our retail, catering and small business customers prosper through improving our choice, prices and service.\u201d David Alexander, lead analyst at the consultancy Global Data, said the trading update suggested the Booker business was in healthy shape. \u201cIt continues to be the grocery sector that weathers the storm of rising prices and squeezed household finances better than non-food retail. With Tesco keen to get a slice of Booker\u2019s restaurant ties, it will be heartened by the news that both the catering and retail sides of the business performed well.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Murdoch family\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky has been referred to the Competition and Markets Authority for further investigation. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, told the House of Commons of the decision two days after signalling her intention to pass the deal to the competition watchdog for six months of in-depth scrutiny. The CMA will consider not just the proposed deal\u2019s effect on media plurality, but also the Murdochs\u2019 commitment to broadcasting standards. The Murdochs\u2019 21st Century Fox and Sky, which had been given 10 days to respond, said they would not be making substantive representations about Bradley\u2019s decision. \u201cI can confirm my final decision is to refer the merger to the CMA for a phase 2 investigation on media plurality and genuine commitment to broadcasting standards grounds,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI will issue and publish my formal referral decision in the coming days. I will also publish the substantive representations I have received during this process shortly.\u201d Once the CMA has completed its investigation it will advise Bradley, who will then take a final decision on whether the merger can proceed. She could attach conditions that would apply if 21st Century Fox wants to complete the deal. It had been expected that Bradley would order an inquiry by the competition regulator on the grounds of media plurality, ut she in effect overruled Ofcom, the media regulator, in also calling for a broadcasting standards investigation after misconduct allegations at Fox News in the US. In a statement to the stock market, 21st Century Fox said: \u201cYesterday we wrote to the secretary of state expressing disappointment that she had changed her mind and decided not to follow the advice of the independent and expert regulator Ofcom regarding broadcasting standards, but informing her that we did not intend to make further representations and encouraged her to make a prompt referral. \u201cWe now, therefore, look forward to engaging constructively with the CMA, as an independent authority, and hope that the findings of this process will be respected by the secretary of state.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said Bradley had \u201cshown courage in the face of pressure from the Murdochs. \u201cThis referral is completely justified on grounds both of plurality and broadcasting standards. \u201cIt is now over to the Competition and Markets Authority to properly scrutinise this bid and stand up for a plural and independent media. \u201cIn the current climate, media outlets in this country are particularly vulnerable to takeover because of the weakness of the pound. Media power should not be an auction to the highest bidder.\u201d Correspondence between Bradley and Ofcom revealed that she had raised concerns about both a string of sexual harassment allegations at Fox News and claims that the broadcaster had colluded with the White House on a discredited story alleging that a murdered Democrat aide, Seth Rich, was the source of leaked emails. Fox is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. If its bid is successful and it takes full ownership of Sky, the satellite broadcaster will join the Sun, the Times and talkRadio in the Murdochs\u2019 British media empire, giving the family a bigger reach than any news provider apart from the BBC. \u201cThe Murdochs have finally had to concede the investigation they dreaded,\u201d said Alex Wilks, the campaign director of the activist group Avaaz. \u201cNow the CMA must use their extensive powers to dig up the Murdochs\u2019 darkest secrets. The truth will stop this takeover.\u201d In a short statement to the stock market, Sky said: \u201cWe note the swift decision to now refer this to the CMA and will continue to engage constructively in this process.\u201d The CMA said it was \u201cdue to receive the formal written referral in the coming days. On receipt of the formal written referral the CMA will open an investigation. No action will be taken until this referral is officially received.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A campaigner who forced the Bank of England to have female representation on banknotes has pledged to donate her first Jane Austen tenner to a women\u2019s shelter as the new plastic currency enters circulation. Caroline Criado-Perez threatened to take the Bank to court for discrimination when the former governor Mervyn King announced that it was phasing out paper fivers featuring the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, the only woman other than the Queen to feature on legal tender at that time. They were replaced last year by the new \u00a35 featuring Winston Churchill. But on the new \u00a310 note the bank backed down and on Thursday more than 1bn new tenners featuring Austen begin entering circulation. It ends a four-month period in which there has been no usable note featuring a woman other than the Queen. Criado-Perez was subjected to online abuse after leading the campaign for female representation. Writing in the London Evening Standard she said she would not quite believe the success of the campaign until she held a new tenner in her hand. \u201cI imagine it will feel amazing,\u201d she said. Criado-Perez, co-founder of the feminist blog the Women\u2019s Room, added: \u201cI\u2019ll be donating my first Austen tenner to my local women\u2019s shelter. It feels like the right way to end this chapter of my life.\u201d Criado-Perez told the Guardian said: \u201cThis represents so much more than a banknote: the Bank of England changed their entire selection procedure to make sure an all-male line-up would never happen again. That was the real fight and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of achieving.\u201d She pointed out that Austen was the bank\u2019s choice not hers. The Bank of England has persevered with polymer notes despite complaints from religious and vegan groups over the animal fat tallow used in the production process. After the bank issued polymer fivers last year one vegan restaurant in Cambridge refused to accept the new notes. A staff member at the Rainbow Cafe in Cambridge said she was unsure whether it be would be accepting the new plastic \u00a310. \u201cI haven\u2019t discussed it with the owner,\u201d she said. The cafe\u2019s owner, Sharon Meijland, has been contacted by the Guardian, but has yet to respond. For the first time the new note includes a tactile feature aimed at helping blind and partially sighted people identify it. The Royal Institute for the Blind helped design the feature, which consists of two groups of four raised bumps in the top left corner of the note. The new notes are 15% smaller than the paper version, which will be withdrawn from circulation in the spring. The new \u00a310 note also includes a metallic image of Winchester Cathedral, where Austen was buried. It appears overlaid on a transparent window on the note and is gold on the front and silver on the back. Under the portrait of Austen is a quote from her best known work, Pride and Prejudice. But the line, \u201cI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading,\u201d has sparked controversy because as critics point out it spoken by a character with no interest in books. The Queen will be presented with the first new tenner \u2013 with serial number AA01 000001 \u2013 while Prince Philip is given the second and Theresa May the third. The general public must wait a little longer while Britain\u2019s 48,000 cash machines are loaded with the notes. Only a handful of ATMs around the UK are expected to be dispensing them on Thursday. Collectors are on the hunt for very low serial numbers \u2013 those beginning AA01 \u2013 after the lowest number \u00a35 note issued to the public, AA01000017, sold for \u00a34,105 at a charity auction last year. Popular serial numbers for the new \u00a310 note are expected to be the birthday of Jane Austen, 16 121775, and her death, 18 071817.",

      "bodyText": "Aygul Zagidullina is not mad about football, but when she received a newsletter through the door about new rental homes opening next to Wembley Stadium in north London, she and her husband did not need much persuading. They were the first tenants to move into Quintain\u2019s 7,600-home Wembley Park development, which will include 5,000 purpose-built rental homes. It is the biggest build-to-rent project in the UK, worth \u00a33bn, and when it is finished in 2025-26, about 15,000 people are expected to be living and working on the 85-acre site. Purpose-built blocks of rental homes are common in other countries such as the US, Germany and France. They are a relatively new phenomenon in Britain, but are fast becoming a hot investment for property developers and City firms such as Legal &amp; General, which are eager to tap into the rising trend for long-term renting. The sector is expanding across England, with 80,855 homes either completed or planned, according to recent official figures. Angus Dodd, the chief executive of Quintain, which was acquired by US private equity firm Lone Star in 2015, said the company decided to switch from building for sale to building homes for rent because it provided a reliable long-term income stream, in contrast to the ups and downs of the traditional housebuilding cycle. He said government support for and investor interest in build-to-rent had increased. \u201cIt\u2019s a solution to the housing crisis; it could be a big solution,\u201d Dodd said. \u201cIt sits alongside housing in all its various forms \u2013 modular housing, micro living.\u201d About 16% of the tenants already living at Wembley Park \u2013 a third rental block has just been completed \u2013 are key workers such as nurses, teachers, soldiers and police officers. More than 1,300 homes have been built and a further 3,000 are under construction. The tallest tower will be 26 storeys, but not high enough to look into the stadium. Most of the planned 63 new buildings will have roof gardens. A theatre, office buildings, a primary school, health facilities and a park the size of four football pitches are planned. Zagidullina and her husband left their privately rented one-bedroom flat in Whitechapel in east London, where they paid \u00a3800 a month in rent and moved into a \u00a31,500-a-month one-bed at Wembley Park in March 2016. When baby Emily was born nine months ago, they upgraded to a two-bedroom flat with a terrace, with a monthly rent of \u00a32,050. The rent includes utility bills and ultra-fast broadband. Communal lounge areas adjacent to the entrance come with kitchenettes and Sky TV; there is a residents\u2019 gym and screening room;and a concierge is on hand 24 hours a day to deal with deliveries and emergencies. Quintain stresses that its rental management company Tipi does not charge controversial letting agent fees or for end-of-tenancy cleaning. The government wants to ban fees to letting agents, which tend to average \u00a3223 but can be as high as \u00a3800. Zagidullina described the flats the couple rented previously as \u201ctotal disasters\u201d. \u201cIn Whitechapel, the landlady said her granddaughter was coming to live there and told us \u2018at some point you\u2019ll have to leave,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t know when,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our flat in Seven Sisters didn\u2019t feel hygienic. This is the perfect area, the perfect professional landlord who doesn\u2019t have a granddaughter. It\u2019s perfect for a family \u2026 You pay a little bit more here, but you pay for a nice lifestyle.\u201d Quintain admits that many tenants will be \u201cpaying a premium for the lifestyle,\u201d but it says 32% of the planned homes at Wembley Park will be affordable. This is a higher proportion than seen at many other London developments, and just below the 35% target set by the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan - down from his election promise of 50%. The borough, Brent, is one of London\u2019s poorest but nearly 40% of the affordable Wembley Park homes will be let at a discount to market rents, with the maximum rent set at 65% to 80% of market value. A further 28% will be at an affordable rent and 33% are earmarked for shared ownership and discount market sale. Brent supports the mayor in seeking a minimum of 35% affordable housing on all new developments. It delivered 30% in the three years to 2015-16, above the 24% London average, according to a council spokeswoman. \u201cWe expect to see Quintain construct 3,000 new homes by the end of the year. This can only help to tackle the dire housing situation in London,\u201d she said. The first big UK build-to-rent scheme to get off the ground was East Village in Stratford, the former Olympic athletes\u2019 quarters which were turned into 3,000 homes by Delancey and Qatari Diar, the property arm of Qatar\u2019s ruling family. Half of them are managed by Get Living, which prides itself on its no-fee, no-security-deposit policy, and three-year tenancies with resident-only break clauses - under which the tenant but not the landlord can terminate their agreement. The Duke of Westminster\u2019s property firm is also getting in on the game. It intends to build 1,500 rental homes on the site of the former Peek Freans biscuit factory in Bermondsey in south-east London, where Garibaldi and Bourbon biscuits were invented, but which closed in 1989. If Grosvenor\u2019s \u00a3500m masterplan comes to fruition, people will be living on the factory site from 2020-21 when the 12-acre development reopens to the public. Grosvenor, which is owned by 26-year-old Hugh Grosvenor, Britain\u2019s youngest billionaire, intends to file for planning permission in October. At Wembley Park and the former biscuit factory, the buildings are being designed for renters, with hotel-style lobbies and two-bed flats with en-suite double bedrooms to appeal to sharers and three- and four-bedroom flats for families. Quintain and Grosvenor will manage the homes long term and plan more build-to-rent projects in London. Simon Harding-Roots, Grosvenor\u2019s executive director of major projects, said: \u201cBuild to rent hasn\u2019t been done at scale for a century in this country by the private sector.\u201d He believes the private sector needs to step up its game. \u201cCouncils can\u2019t provide all of this and why should they?\u201d he said. \u201cThe housing crisis is obviously very real. We believe we can make a real difference there.\u201d Harding-Roots said the Bermondsey flats would cater for a broad range of incomes including key workers earning \u00a325,000-plus a year \u2013 \u201cthe nurses, teachers and policemen who need to be in London\u201d. A number of flats will be let at discounted market rent. Discounts are likely to range from 20% off market prices to the \u201cLondon living rent\u201d with a discount of 50-55% \u2013 a new type of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d housing for middle-income Londoners introduced by Khan. Grosvenor wants to make the discounts flexible, so they can be \u201cdialled up or down\u201d if tenants\u2019 incomes change, so they are not forced to move. Southwark council expects Grosvenor to deliver 35% affordable housing, including flats at social rent. Councillor Mark Williams, the cabinet member for regeneration and new homes, said: \u201cThe biscuit factory is an interesting project that supports our priorities including the provision of much-needed new homes, especially for residents on low to middle incomes.\u201d The yellow-brick site is a long way from Grosvenor\u2019s traditional heartland in Mayfair and Belgravia, two of the capital\u2019s most exclusive neighbourhoods. The firm is moving into more affordable housing projects after being hit by the downturn in the luxury property market. Frank Turner, 78, who worked at the biscuit factory from 1960 until 1989 and became its chief fire officer, welcomed Grosvenor\u2019s attempt to \u201cbreathe life back into the site\u201d. He said: \u201cThe government are saying you should have homes for lower and middle income type people and in the end, with some companies, it doesn\u2019t materialise. If Grosvenor can do it, good luck to them, because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed.\u201d Up to 11 residential blocks of varying heights are planned with the tallest tower, of 25 storeys, to be built in the centre of the site, which will include a new 600-place secondary school. The biggest of the biscuit factory buildings, a former warehouse, is to be converted into a five-storey block of flats with a large atrium lined with shops and cafes. The planned public roof garden, with views across London, will hark back to the historic garden where Peek Freans workers used to enjoy a cup of tea - and a biscuit - during break times. Two new routes under a nearby railway line will link the development with the Blue Street Market, which has dwindled to a handful of traders. When the Guardian visited, only Russell Dryden, a fishmonger, was plying his trade in the square. He expressed hope that the Grosvenor development, which is expected to create 50 new business spaces in the Victorian railway arches and 1,300 permanent jobs, would revive the market.",

It is the biggest build-to-rent project in the UK, worth \u00a33bn, and when it is finished in 2025-26, about 15,000 people are expected to be living and working on the 85-acre site.</p> <p>Purpose-built blocks of rental homes are common in other countries such as the US, Germany and France. They are a relatively new phenomenon in Britain, but are fast becoming a hot investment for property developers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/27/legal-general-to-build-and-rent-out-3000-new-uk-homes\">City firms such as Legal &amp; General</a>, which are eager to tap into the rising trend for long-term renting. The sector is expanding across England, with 80,855 homes either completed or planned, according to recent official figures.</p> <p>Angus Dodd, the chief executive of Quintain, which was <a href=\"tel:bought by US private equity group Lone Star for %C2%A3700m.\">acquired by US private equity firm Lone Star in 2015</a>, said the company decided to switch from building for sale to building homes for rent because it provided a reliable long-term income stream, in contrast to the ups and downs of the traditional housebuilding cycle. He said government support for and investor interest in build-to-rent had increased.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a solution to the housing crisis; it could be a big solution,\u201d Dodd said. \u201cIt sits alongside housing in all its various forms \u2013 modular housing, micro living.\u201d</p> <p>About 16% of the tenants already living at Wembley Park \u2013 a third rental block has just been completed \u2013 are key workers such as nurses, teachers, soldiers and police officers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53d2b0cdd937ab188e4fe98af071859398c5aebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53d2b0cdd937ab188e4fe98af071859398c5aebe/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wembley Park development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of one of the Wembley Park built-to-let flats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quintain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 1,300 homes have been built and a further 3,000 are under construction. The tallest tower will be 26 storeys, but not high enough to look into the stadium. Most of the planned 63 new buildings will have roof gardens. A theatre, office buildings, a primary school, health facilities and a park the size of four football pitches are planned.</p> <p>Zagidullina and her husband left their privately rented one-bedroom flat in Whitechapel in east London, where they paid \u00a3800 a month in rent and moved into a \u00a31,500-a-month one-bed at Wembley Park in March 2016. When baby Emily was born nine months ago, they upgraded to a two-bedroom flat with a terrace, with a monthly rent of \u00a32,050.<br></p> <p>The rent includes utility bills and ultra-fast broadband. Communal lounge areas adjacent to the entrance come with kitchenettes and Sky TV; there is a residents\u2019 gym and screening room;and a concierge is on hand 24 hours a day to deal with deliveries and emergencies.</p> <p>Quintain stresses that its rental management company Tipi does not charge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/01/letting-agents-found-charging-tenants-more-than-800-in-fees\">controversial letting agent fees</a> or for end-of-tenancy cleaning. The government wants to ban fees to letting agents, which tend to average \u00a3223 but can be as high as \u00a3800.</p> <p>Zagidullina described the flats the couple rented previously as \u201ctotal disasters\u201d. \u201cIn Whitechapel, the landlady said her granddaughter was coming to live there and told us \u2018at some point you\u2019ll have to leave,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t know when,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cAnd our flat in Seven Sisters didn\u2019t feel hygienic. This is the perfect area, the perfect professional landlord who doesn\u2019t have a granddaughter. It\u2019s perfect for a family \u2026 You pay a little bit more here, but you pay for a nice lifestyle.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/07/uk-house-prices-properties-halifax-employment\">UK house prices rising amid shortage of properties, says Halifax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Quintain admits that many tenants will be \u201cpaying a premium for the lifestyle,\u201d but it says 32% of the planned homes at Wembley Park will be affordable. This is a higher proportion than seen at many other London developments, and just below the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/29/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-35-affordable-homes-target-deal-developers\">35% target set by the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan</a> - down from his election promise of 50%. </p> <p>The borough, Brent, is one of London\u2019s poorest but nearly 40% of the affordable Wembley Park homes will be let at a discount to market rents, with the maximum rent set at 65% to 80% of market value. A further 28% will be at an affordable rent and 33% are earmarked for shared ownership and discount market sale.</p> <p>Brent supports the mayor in seeking a minimum of 35% affordable housing on all new developments. It delivered 30% in the three years to 2015-16, above the 24% London average, according to a council spokeswoman. \u201cWe expect to see Quintain construct 3,000 new homes by the end of the year. This can only help to tackle the dire housing situation in London,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The first big UK build-to-rent scheme to get off the ground was East Village in Stratford, the former Olympic athletes\u2019 quarters which were turned into 3,000 homes by Delancey and Qatari Diar, the property arm of Qatar\u2019s ruling family. Half of them are managed by Get Living, which prides itself on its no-fee, no-security-deposit policy, and three-year tenancies with resident-only break clauses - under which the tenant but not the landlord can terminate their agreement.<br></p> <p>The Duke of Westminster\u2019s property firm is also getting in on the game. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/duke-of-westminsters-property-group-to-build-1500-rental-homes-in-london\">intends to build 1,500 rental homes on the site of the former Peek Freans biscuit factory</a> in Bermondsey in south-east London, where Garibaldi and Bourbon biscuits were invented, but which closed in 1989.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50e2b03235edc1a31de104fb504b1443bd71180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50e2b03235edc1a31de104fb504b1443bd71180/0_340_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grosvenor\u2019s Bermondsey site\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grosvenor\u2019s Bermondsey site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Grosvenor\u2019s \u00a3500m masterplan comes to fruition, people will be living on the factory site from 2020-21 when the 12-acre development reopens to the public. Grosvenor, which is owned by 26-year-old Hugh Grosvenor, Britain\u2019s youngest billionaire, intends to file for planning permission in October.</p> <p>At Wembley Park and the former biscuit factory, the buildings are being designed for renters, with hotel-style lobbies and two-bed flats with en-suite double bedrooms to appeal to sharers and three- and four-bedroom flats for families.</p> <p>Quintain and Grosvenor will manage the homes long term and plan more build-to-rent projects in London. </p> <p>Simon Harding-Roots, Grosvenor\u2019s executive director of major projects, said: \u201cBuild to rent hasn\u2019t been done at scale for a century in this country by the private sector.\u201d</p> <p>He believes the private sector needs to step up its game. \u201cCouncils can\u2019t provide all of this and why should they?\u201d he said. \u201cThe housing crisis is obviously very real. We believe we can make a real difference there.\u201d</p> <p>Harding-Roots said the Bermondsey flats would cater for a broad range of incomes including key workers earning \u00a325,000-plus a year \u2013 \u201cthe nurses, teachers and policemen who need to be in London\u201d.</p> <p>A number of flats will be let at discounted market rent.
