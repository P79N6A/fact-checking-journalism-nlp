      "bodyText": "Moody's has cut the ratings of 15 of the world's biggest banks, hours after the markets were digesting the admission by Spain that its banks could need up to \u20ac62bn of bailout money to see them through the next three years. The result of the independent audit of Spain's banks put the gap in their finances at between \u20ac16bn and \u20ac62bn \u2013 similar to the \u20ac50bn calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) two weeks ago. Banking giants including Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland all had their credit ratings cut. The ratings agency said the cuts reflected declining profitability in an industry suffering from a slowdown in economic growth, tougher regulations and nervous investors. A downgrade can push up the cost of borrowing for a bank and require it to put up extra collateral for some existing business. Higher borrowing costs on the market could also lead banks to push up borrowing costs to customers. Moody's downgraded the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland by one notch \u2013 as had been warned. RBS said this would force it to post \u00a39bn of extra collateral against existing positions but said it disputed the ratings change, which also affected its short-term debt rating. HSBC, which had been warned of a two notch hit, declined to comment after it was cut by just one notch while Barclays was cut by the two notches that the agency had warned it faced. Moody's said the banks \"have significant exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized losses inherent to capital markets activities\". Lloyds Banking Group, almost 40% owned by the British taxpayer, was cut by one notch rather than the two that had been considered and it said the mooted change \"would have limited impact on our funding costs and market capacity\". Morgan Stanley had its rating cut to Baa1, just three notches above the junk, or non-investment grade, status that many bond buyers avoid. Citigroup, which had its rating cut from A3 to Baa2, hit out at the agency, calling it \"arbitrary\" and \"completely unwarranted\". Goldman Sachs's rating was cut to to A3 from A1. Moody's cuts came after US and European stock markets had all closed down. In the US there was fresh evidence that the recovery in the jobs market was stalling while manufacturing slows. In Germany, Europe's strongest economy, private sector growth shrank for the second month in a row, according to a survey by Matrix analysts. Germany's manufacturing activity hit a three-year low, according to the survey. The downgrades had been expected since February when Moody's announced a review of more than 100 financial institutions' financial health as a result of the eurozone crisis in a simultaneous review of 17 banks with major investment banking operations. Credit Suisse was hit hard by the full three notches it had faced. Moody's cut its ratings on Spanish banks in May and Thursday's independent assessment of Spain's banks will be used by the government in Madrid to calculate the final sum when it makes its formal petition for bailout money from Europe's rescue funds. The figures were well below the maximum of \u20ac100bn that eurozone governments have offered Spain to bail out banks that are still laden with toxic assets left over from a property bubble that burst four years ago. Officials said the formal petition would come within days, but did not say what the final figure would be or whether the government would add a security cushion. The studies, carried out by auditing companies Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman, covered 14 banking groups that account for 90% of the sector in Spain. Officials hoped that the figures would help calm markets, which responded to the announcement of the bailout two weeks ago by putting further pressure on Spain's state borrowing costs. \"We hope this will be definitive,\" said the secretary of state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez. \"We have a generous backstop and are already carrying out a very aggressive provisioning.\" Markets had lost confidence in Spain's ability to judge its own banking needs after the two rounds of provisioning ordered so far this year failed to prevent the downfall of Bankia, the country's fourth biggest lender, now part-nationalised. Bankia's new management has already said it needs an injection of \u20ac19bn of capital. \"There was some uncertainty about the resistance of the system,\" Jim\u00e9nez admitted. \"This is an additional exercise in transparency.\" Spain's borrowing costs had been falling in recent days but on Thursday the country still had to pay its highest interest rate for 16 years to raise money over three and five years. The auditors did not produce figures for individual banks, though officials insisted that the study showed that the biggest three lenders \u2013 Santander, BBVA and Caixabank \u2013 would not need any injection of public capital. A second group of banks may be able to raise capital themselves or might prefer to ask for bailout money. A third group of lenders is made up of former savings banks, like Bankia, that have already received state support. Analysts welcomed the results, but warned they were based on figures that are already six months out of date, in a country that is now in recession. \"The decision to bring in independent consultants to pore over the loan books of banks has injected much-needed credibility into the restructuring of Spain's banking sector,\" said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. \"The perception among foreign investors that the severity of the problems in the banking system are not being recognised is no longer justified.\" Economy minister Luis de Guindos, who was in Luxembourg with eurozone colleagues to discuss Spain's request, said a formal application would be made within a few days. Eurozone finance ministers offered Spain a bailout loan of up to \u20ac100bn on 9 June. The terms of the loan \u2013 for which the Spanish government, rather than the banks, will ultimately be responsible \u2013 still have to be negotiated. \u2022 This article was updated on Friday 22 June to take in the downgrading of banks",

      "standfirst": "Ben Bernanke extends Operation Twist stimulus but warns that unemployment is unlikely to improve before end of the year", 
      "body": "<p>The US Federal Reserve announced a $267bn (\u00a3176bn) plan to underpin the US's fragile recovery Wednesday as chairman Ben Bernanke warned that unemployment was unlikely to improve before the end of the year.</p> <p>The plan \u2013 an extension of a scheme known as Operation Twist \u2013 aims to drive down long-term interest rate and encourage borrowing. The announcement came as the latest statement from the Fed painted a gloomier picture of the US economy and said it was prepared to take more action if necessary.</p> <p>The Fed said that the growth in employment \"has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated,\" and that household spending \"appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.\" The Fed also reiterated its concern that \"strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks\" to growth.</p> <p>That news will be a blow to the Obama administration in the run-up to an election that looks set to be dominated by economic news in general and the unemployment rate in particular.</p> <p>At a press conference Bernanke said the Fed had been too optimistic in its projections for recovery, and warned again that Europe was a significant drag on the US recovery.</p> <p>Even though the Fed said the US recovery appears to be slowing, Bernanke stopped short of a third round of quantitative easing (QE3), a more ambitious \u2013 and expensive \u2013 stimulus programme. He said: \"We still do have considerable scope to do more and we're prepared to do more.\"</p> <p>\"People are finding jobs, just not at the rate we would like to see,\" said Bernanke.

      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve announced a $267bn (\u00a3176bn) plan to underpin the US's fragile recovery Wednesday as chairman Ben Bernanke warned that unemployment was unlikely to improve before the end of the year. The plan \u2013 an extension of a scheme known as Operation Twist \u2013 aims to drive down long-term interest rate and encourage borrowing. The announcement came as the latest statement from the Fed painted a gloomier picture of the US economy and said it was prepared to take more action if necessary. The Fed said that the growth in employment \"has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated,\" and that household spending \"appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.\" The Fed also reiterated its concern that \"strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks\" to growth. That news will be a blow to the Obama administration in the run-up to an election that looks set to be dominated by economic news in general and the unemployment rate in particular. At a press conference Bernanke said the Fed had been too optimistic in its projections for recovery, and warned again that Europe was a significant drag on the US recovery. Even though the Fed said the US recovery appears to be slowing, Bernanke stopped short of a third round of quantitative easing (QE3), a more ambitious \u2013 and expensive \u2013 stimulus programme. He said: \"We still do have considerable scope to do more and we're prepared to do more.\" \"People are finding jobs, just not at the rate we would like to see,\" said Bernanke. The Fed is prepared to do more if it thinks necessary, he said but those actions have consequences. \"I don't think they should be launched lightly,\" he said. The Fed predicted the unemployment rate would be 8% to 8.2%, roughly today's levels, at the end of this year compared with the projection of 7.8% to 8% in its April forecast. Bernanke warned that political infighting over the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" could also have dire consequences. On December 31, Bush-era tax cuts are due to expire and if Republicans and Democrats fail to reach a compromise, the US faces steep spending cuts that Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of investment firm Pimco, has estimated could be equivalent to 4% of GDP. Bernanke said Europe remained a grave concern. He said it was for European leaders, not the US, to address their issues. \"At this point we're mostly just in consultation mode,\" he said. \"We are hoping for the best \u2026 but we are prepared in case things get worse to protect the US economy and the US financial system.\" \"If those risks increase then we suspect the Fed would be pretty quick off the mark in taking more aggressive action,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. David Semmens, senior US economist at Standard Chartered, said the Fed's actions showed it was \"taking the slowdown seriously but they are not concerned about a return to recession.\" Gus Faucher, senior macro-economist at PNC Financial, said the move was largely in line with expectations but still left unanswered the big question: \"What is the benchmark for QE3?\" The news left Wall Street flat. The Dow Jones ended the day just 0.1% down. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June. The original headline said the Federal Reserve would \"pump\" money into the US economy, which is incorrect",

The Fed downgraded its US growth forecasts for 2012 to 1.9%-2.4%, from the 2.4%-2.9% predicted in April, as Bernanke and the Federal Open Markets Committee agreed to extend Operation Twist to boost confidence amid falling consumer demand and a drop in output growth over recent months. The intervention is expected to trigger a wave of activity by central banks across the world following fears that the euro crisis and severe austerity measures across the developed world have extinguished signs of recovery in China and many developing countries. Central bank officials said they were especially nervous following the deterioration in the Spanish economy and heightened fears of a sovereign default in the eurozone. EU officials said they were working on plans to protect ailing countries from collapse and a Spanish minister said support for a euro-wide policy of bond purchases by the EU's main rescue fund was gaining support. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to offer her backing, saying Greece must uphold its side of the bargain. \"It's obvious that the reforms that were agreed in the past are the right steps and that they therefore must be implemented.\" Merkel, who invited the new prime minister of Greece, Antonis Samaras, to Berlin for talks, has consistently voiced her opposition to indebted countries winning easier terms without more stringent economic reforms.

The agreement could set a precedent that sees fewer retailers slip into administration.</p> <p>It comes after the collapse of several high street stores in the past year, including Clinton Cards, Game and Peacocks, with an estimated 10,000 redundancies.</p> <p>Fitness First has agreed to a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) through KPMG, which will allow it to pay between 23p and 28p for every \u00a31 it owes, compared with 0.5p if it were to fall into administration.</p> <p>CVAs have been used before by struggling companies, but only to negotiate rents on empty sites. It means struggling retailers could impose rent reductions on all landlords, rather than having to negotiate with landlords individually.</p> <p>Barry Gross of law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner said: \"This is good news for the high street and gives more options to retailers to help them avoid administration. The biggest issue facing the retail market generally is that rents are high and in difficult trading conditions there is nothing they can do because it is a fixed cost. But iIf more retailers use these kind of CVAs, which is likely after its success at Fitness First, it should avoid future administrations \u2013 which are far more costly.\"</p> <p>He added that the gym chain's landlords had 28 days to appeal against the decision.</p> <p>Blacks Leisure and JJB Sports used CVAs, but their deals sought to cut rent in empty stores, while continuing to pay full rates in stores that were still open. However, both firms fell into administration.</p> <p>The Fitness First deal will lead to the company selling off 67 of its UK gyms \u2013 with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's no-frills easyGym thought to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. A further 79 gyms will get rent reductions and in return some of the biggest landlords will receive a stake in the business.</p> <p>The private equity group BC Partners bought Fitness First in 2005 for \u20ac1.2bn and tried unsuccessfully to float the business in Singapore. But the chain has struggled recently after its previous owners piled it with debt after a series of acquisitions, leaving it with spiralling interest bills.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 June</p>",

The country's biggest gym chain will also shed nearly half its sites and have about \u00a3600m of its debts wiped out. The agreement could set a precedent that sees fewer retailers slip into administration. It comes after the collapse of several high street stores in the past year, including Clinton Cards, Game and Peacocks, with an estimated 10,000 redundancies. Fitness First has agreed to a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) through KPMG, which will allow it to pay between 23p and 28p for every \u00a31 it owes, compared with 0.5p if it were to fall into administration. CVAs have been used before by struggling companies, but only to negotiate rents on empty sites. It means struggling retailers could impose rent reductions on all landlords, rather than having to negotiate with landlords individually. Barry Gross of law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner said: \"This is good news for the high street and gives more options to retailers to help them avoid administration. The biggest issue facing the retail market generally is that rents are high and in difficult trading conditions there is nothing they can do because it is a fixed cost. But iIf more retailers use these kind of CVAs, which is likely after its success at Fitness First, it should avoid future administrations \u2013 which are far more costly.\" He added that the gym chain's landlords had 28 days to appeal against the decision. Blacks Leisure and JJB Sports used CVAs, but their deals sought to cut rent in empty stores, while continuing to pay full rates in stores that were still open. However, both firms fell into administration. The Fitness First deal will lead to the company selling off 67 of its UK gyms \u2013 with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's no-frills easyGym thought to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. A further 79 gyms will get rent reductions and in return some of the biggest landlords will receive a stake in the business. The private equity group BC Partners bought Fitness First in 2005 for \u20ac1.2bn and tried unsuccessfully to float the business in Singapore. But the chain has struggled recently after its previous owners piled it with debt after a series of acquisitions, leaving it with spiralling interest bills. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June",

The boast is probably fair \u2013 but only because past efforts in this field, such as Labour's introduction in 2002 of an advisory vote on pay, were utterly feeble. Let's be clear about what Cable has done: he has needlessly watered down his original idea to introduce a binding annual vote on pay, opting instead to make such votes happen only every three years in most cases. Cable's cover story is that companies should set pay with long-term principles in mind. Thus, as long as pay committees abide by policies that are approved by shareholders every three years, the bog-standard advisory vote should suffice in the other years. This logic is not persuasive. The chief problem is the vagueness of the term \"pay policy\". Take Barclays, where chairman Marcus Agius has often boasted that \"we pay as little as we can get away with\". Who wouldn't applaud that fine principle? But then you see how Agius and his colleagues interpret it \u2013 for example, the \u00a32.7m bonus for Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond in a year in which returns on equity were \"unacceptable\" (Diamond's word). True, in practice, companies would have to set some parameters within their pay policies \u2013 a crude pledge that the non-executive would try their hardest wouldn't do. But the point remains: awarding bonuses and share options involves matters of judgment and discretion. The shareholders' vote, at least in part, is meant to be a verdict on how the directors have exercised that judgment. And, as the bonuses and share awards are dished out annually, a binding vote should happen every year if it is to happen at all. Still, let's not be too churlish. Assuming Cable's reforms do not get diluted any further as they go through parliament, at least the first binding votes will take place at annual meetings in 2014. Many doubters of the government's resolve thought the day would never come. There are other good elements, such as the principle that companies won't be able to pay exiting directors more than shareholders have agreed. There is also a beefing-up of the advisory vote on pay \u2013 a \"no\" vote will automatically trigger a binding vote the following year. Call the package a step forward \u2013 just not the three steps forward that it could have been. But remember, too, the context here. There are still too few engaged shareholders. Even many of the activists don't dare to vote against the re-election of a director, even the chairman of a pay committee whose report has been rejected. And many companies that have experienced revolts over pay continue to believe they have a communications problem and not a pay problem. These are all deep cultural problems that have contributed to the widening of the gulf between boardroom pay and boardroom performance. A binding vote, whether held annually or every three years, is far from being a cure-all.",

      "bodyText": "Public sector employment dropped to its lowest level in nine years in April as the government pushed ahead with its plans to reduce the size of the public pay bill. The number of public sector jobs fell by 39,000 between February and April to 5.9 million, the lowest total since March 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics. Ministers said the drop reflected a deliberate policy shift to promote private sector employment, which increased by 205,000, the second-strongest three-month figure in 13 years. The strong rise, led by a surge in manufacturing jobs in the West Midlands, meant the jobless total dropped 51,000 to 2.61 million and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 8.2%. Ministers were cheered by the number of people gaining full-time jobs after a run of figures showing most people reluctantly accepting part-time work. The employment rate increased by 166,000 to almost 29.28 million with the increase evenly spread between 82,000 taking full-time jobs and 83,000 taking part-time jobs. However, economists said the jobs figures were a lagging indicator and tended to reflect the mood of employers at least six months ago. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data company Markit, said the latest undercurrents provided worrying signs of a weaker jobs market going forward. The eurozone crisis, which has accelerated in the first half of the year, and the UK's return to recession, have undermined business confidence and sent shoppers scurrying from the high street. \"The latest labour market data point to near-record hiring in the first quarter, but also suggest that the health of the job market has since deteriorated slightly, adding to hopes that the Bank of England will inject further stimulus to help boost growth,\" he said. Employment minister Chris Grayling said he remained cautious given \"the continuing economic challenges\" the government faced, but planned to stick with reductions in public sector jobs. \"These figures show that with the right support in place, it is possible for the private sector to create jobs while the public sector employment is falling.\" The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in May rose by 8,100 to 1.6 million, ending two months of declines and adding to concerns that the government faces rising unemployment costs later this year. People unemployed for more than a year increased by 85,000 to 886,000, while the number of people unemployed for more than two years rose by 29,000 to 434,000. Unemployment among the young remained above 1 million. The bigger than expected rise in full-time employment made only a small dent in the proportion of people wanting better paid work. The ONS said almost 8 million people are now in a part-time job, while those working part time because they cannot find full-time work increased by 25,000 to 1.4 million. Self-employment has also surged during the recession, reaching a record figure of 4.17 million, up by 84,000 since the previous quarter. Public sector unions said they were incensed by the cuts which had not only put record numbers of people out of work during the last two years, but eaten into the living standards of staff who remained in a job. Average earnings increased by 2.1% in the year to April, less than the 2.8% rise in inflation. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis warned that a backlash against the government's public sector pay freeze is set to \"explode\" and could lead to a fresh bout of strikes. Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary, said: \"Unemployment of 2.61 million five years into recession is unacceptable, unnecessary and an unforgivable waste of human talents. Prentis said he was determined to \"smash\" the coalition's policy of freezing the wages of council, health and other workers, followed by two years of pegging rises to 1%. In a speech to the union's annual conference he said industrial action will be taken if necessary to fight the squeeze on pay, adding that a demonstration planned in London for 20 October will be the biggest ever held. \"We are putting the government on notice. Our demand is for decent pay. If we cannot win through negotiation we will fight to win it through strike action. We will smash the pay freeze. \"Putting pay on ice has been devastating for public sector workers and their families. It cannot go on and we will not let it go on. They are scared of spending in shops and businesses and this is not only misery for families but also condemns our chances of economic recovery to the dustbin.\"",

Severn Trent lost 115p to \u00a316.34 after shareholders lost the right to a 42p dividend and a 63p special payment. United Utilities - also ex-div - fell 13.5p to 656p. Home Retail lost 4.85p to 87p as HSBC moved from overweight to neutral in the wake of the Argos and Homebase owner's update on Tuesday, and cut its target price from 110p to 100p. The bank said: [It was a] better-than-expected first quarter outturn but limited visibility is likely to restrict further upside in the short-term. A negative outlook from US consumer group Procter &amp; Gamble hit rivals, with Unilever down 13p at \u00a320.62 and Reckitt Benckiser 30p lower at \u00a333.67. Lower down the market Ithaca Energy, the North Sea oil explorer, rose 4.5p to 116p on speculation that Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum purchaser Korea National Oil Corporation or Soco International could be interested in the North Sea oil producer. Finally Pinnacle Technology added more than 1% to 0.375p after it was selected to deliver the broadcast technology for the BBC's forthcoming Big Weekend in Hackney. This will be the largest ever event broadcast via internet technology instead of traditional telecoms. Pinnacle was recently involved in the outside broadcasting of the Queen's Jubilee and are providing the broadcasting capabilities for international broadcasts at the Olympics.",

Three of the nine monetary policy committee members voted for an extra \u00a350bn of quantitative easing, and one voted for an extra \u00a325bn. According to today's minutes of the MPC's June meeting, five voted for no change. There was general agreement that the world economy is slowing and the UK's double dip recession means that thousands of companies and households are struggling to make ends meet. Banks remain in a parlous state and most people who can pay back their debts are doing so. The same goes for companies. All that argues strongly for the central bank pumping more money into the economy via QE. But the gang of five stuck to their guns. They mention inflation and the likelihood it will stay nearer 3% than 1% over the next year. They worry that QE will push up demand so much that it increases inflation. It is the same argument used by the Tea Party in the US \u2013 without any evidence. Inflation comes from rising commodity prices and food at the moment, not an excess of demand. Their next argument is more plausible. The five say extra QE will be soaked up by the banks, which are still desperate to horde cash to meet regulatory rules. The solution, according to the MPC, is for the new banking regulator, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), to relax the rules on banks at its next meeting later this month. It is possible that a more lenient view of bank capital will free up cash for lending just as much or even more than QE. Who knows, Barclays' boss Bob Diamond might even lend some more to small businesses? Yet while the buck passing goes on, little happens \u2013 except the argument for government action gets ever stronger. More borrowing for investment in public networks and infrastructure, creating jobs and boosting confidence, is a key part of the answer. More borrowing? I hear you ask. Yes, more borrowing. Because when households and corporates cut up their credit cards, the government must pick up some of the slack. Osborne admitted as much in his last autumn statement when he extended the UK's payback period to 2017. At least that was his short term answer. In the medium term he wants the consumer to come roaring back, borrowing like crazy to drive a resurgence in consumption. Under the Treasury's plan the UK only recovers when consumer confidence returns. It's a dishonest tactic that limits government borrowing in favour of private borrowing. When the household sector is already up to its neck in debt, and the UK has the most over-leveraged property market in the world, it would be more honest and transparent if the government carried the burden on its broader shoulders.",

      "bodyText": "New rules which will force publicly listed companies to give shareholders three-yearly votes on executive pay and perks have been announced by the business secretary Vince Cable. The changes announced on Tuesday were immediately described as a climbdown by Labour for failing to live up to previous government promises made in the wake of the so-called \"shareholder spring\" revolt against excessive pay. The moves come amid growing shareholder activism over executive pay, as shown by last week's rejection of WPP's remuneration report, which included a \u00a36.8m pay deal for chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. Currently, shareholder votes are advisory, which means companies can ignore them. Cable is said to have watered down his plans for the binding vote on pay, by requiring an investor poll every three years rather than annually, unless a company makes a material change to a director's deal. Cable told the Commons: \"At a time when the global economy remains fragile, it is neither sustainable nor justifiable to see directors' pay rising at 10% a year while the performance of listed companies lags behind and many employees are having their pay cut or frozen.\" \"For the first time there will be a real, lasting and binding vote on a company's pay policy including their exit payments,\" he said. Cable said binding votes on pay would require the support of a majority of shareholders. If a company chooses to leave its remuneration policy unchanged, a vote would be compulsory every three years, he said. Once a policy is approved, companies would not be allowed to make payments outside its scope, he added. Companies will also be required to explain their policy on payoffs to shareholders, which will also be subject to a binding vote.

      "bodyText": "Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist Capital Economics The minutes of June's MPC meeting provide yet further evidence that more QE is just around the corner. Four members actually voted for more asset purchases at the meeting. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his recent speech, Mervyn King was in this minority. [David] Miles and [Adam] Posen joined him in voting for another \u00a350bn, while Paul Fisher voted for a \u00a325bn increase. What's more, those who voted for no change simply wanted to wait to see how the eurozone crisis unfolded and to check that inflation would fall as expected. Tuesday's figures should provide reassurance on the latter. More stimulus looks close, and for now, the committee still seems to think that more QE (albeit complemented by the credit easing announced last week) is the best way to go. We're sticking with our forecast of another \u00a350bn of gilt purchases at July's meeting. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency broker World First This is not really a shock given the general economic weakness globally and it shows just how close the MPC have come to pumping more money into the economy. The key thing now will be whether the recent 'funding for lending' scheme announced last week by the chancellor is a replacement for or a companion of further QE next month. Following Tuesday's slip in inflation, we are now looking for the Bank to raise asset purchases next month by \u00a350-75bn. Annalisa Piazza, economist at Newedge Strategy The minutes of the June MPC meeting are extremely dovish. They clearly pave the way for additional accommodation in July. We expect a \u00a350bn QE to be delivered in early July. The marked deterioration in activity and risks associated to the EMU debt crisis fully justify additional accommodation in the UK as lower growth would also undermine the inflation scenario in the medium term. Note that Wednesday's labour market figures also support the idea of sluggishness across the UK economy. Indeed, jobless claims rose by 8,100 in May after falling by around 13,000 the previous month. Rob Carnell at ING Bank At the next meeting on 5 July, it seems highly likely that some of the other Bank members, Tucker, Bean, and Dale come alongside governor King, with the most likely outcome now being a \u00a350bn addition to the scheme (depending on the data, \u00a375bn cannot be ruled out). Developments in the eurozone seem to be one of the major drivers for King's conversion, and no doubt some of the other MPC members. But the UK domestic data has also been far worse than expected, with recent GDP data for 1Q12 confirming the technical recession, and survey evidence supporting the official data (the BoE sometimes is a bit dismissive of the official numbers). As well as arguably putting downwards pressure on gilt yields (arguable, as the evidence actually suggests QE provides more support to risk assets, and in turn, raises yields), sterling is likely to come under temporary downward pressure as a result of these developments \u2013 though a policy race to the bottom may be developing (watch this space for what the ECB and Fed do in coming weeks). Howard Archer, chief UK economist, IHS Global Insight The minutes of the June MPC meeting suggest that it is now odds-on that the Bank of England will announce more QE in July. We suspect that latest developments are likely to prod at least one more MPC member into favouring more QE in July, and expect a \u00a350bn portion to be announced. Latest economic data and survey evidence have been weaker and disappointing overall, increasing the risk that the economy suffered further contraction in the second quarter. In addition, although the Greek election result reduced the likelihood of an imminent Greek exit from the eurozone, tensions and problems in the single currency area remain elevated with Spain a central focus.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, was blocked from pumping \u00a350bn of electronic money into the economy earlier this month after he was outvoted on the central bank's interest rate setting body. Minutes of the monetary policy committee meeting reveal a majority voted to keep rates on hold and stick with the current \u00a3325bn of quantitative easing (QE) at its June meeting. King was one of three committee members to vote for an extra \u00a350bn and a fourth said he wanted a more modest \u00a325bn injection of funds. The narrowness of the decision will heighten expectations of a further boost to QE in July after aanother set of lacklustre economic figures, including a rise in jobless claims last month. King will have been disappointed by the vote, after arguing that the world economy remains fragile and the prospects for growth limited. The governor was joined by Adam Posen and David Miles, who have consistently argued for Threadneedle Street to boost its level of bond purchases to ease the pressure on cash-strapped banks.

The minutes show the hawks expect the Financial Policy Committee, which oversees banking regulation, to take a role by loosening the strict rules on bank reserves to ease credit.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel is poised to allow the eurozone's \u20ac750bn (\u00a3605bn) bailout fund to buy up the bonds of crisis-hit governments in a desperate effort to drive down borrowing costs for Spain and Italy and prevent the single currency from imploding. Germany has long opposed allowing the eurozone's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to lend directly to troubled eurozone countries, fearing that Berlin would end up paying the bill, and the beneficiaries would escape the strict conditions imposed on Greece, Portugal and Ireland. But Merkel has come under intense pressure as financial markets have pushed up borrowing costs for Spain to levels that many analysts see as unsustainable. Analysts are likely to see the decision as the first step towards sharing the burden of troubled countries' debts across the single currency's 17 members, though it falls short of the collective loans or \"eurobonds\" proposed by the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. A spokeswoman for Merkel said: \"Nothing has been decided yet.\" The proposal was discussed on the margins of the two-day G20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, which has been dominated by the depressing impact of the eurozone crisis on the world economy. G20 officials believe an announcement could be made by the leaders of the eurozone in the next few days, but stressed they remained unclear as to timing and precise content. A White House official confirmed the eurozone is working on a plan to unveil at next week's summit, and suggested Barack Obama had been advising on the deal. The official said: \"The framework they are building, as they described it to us, amounts to a more forceful response than they've contemplated to date.\" US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner said the euro countries hoped to have a package ready by next week's EU council. He said \"they are putting in place a set of measures that can make sure that they are supporting the financial institutions of europe and they are helping make sure that the countries that are undertaking these reforms, like Spain and Italy, can borrow at existing low interest rates.\" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said: \"In Los Cabos the seeds of a pan-European recovery plan were planted. This must be recognised. European leaders committed to take all measures necessary to safeguard the integrity and stability of the euro area and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks\". It would be the first time the EU bailout funds have been used directly to purchase Spanish debt. It is understood the money would come from the \u20ac500bn European Stability Mechanism and its predecessor, the \u20ac250bn European Financial Stability Facility. Britain does not contribute to either fund. Last week, EU leaders had agreed a line of credit to Spanish banks through the Spanish government, a move that failed to reduce Spanish bond yields. The ECB purchased \u20ac210bn of mainly Greek bonds in 2010, but its involvement was stopped partly because of German opposition. This would be the first time the two bailout funds were used in this way. The funds had been set up to bail out peripheral countries such as Ireland and Portugal, and there will be concern whether the funds have sufficient firepower to help large economies. The German agreement to sanction the move was relayed at a meeting between Obama and Merkel on Monday. The move initially prompted the US president to agree to cancel a further meeting of the eurozone leaders scheduled for late on Monday night. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, said the meeting between the eurozone and Obama had been rescheduled for this morning to brief the Americans on \"mechanisms that allow us to fight speculation\". The private discussions at the G20 have focused repeatedly on the eurozone crisis, and leaders recognise that one summit is not going to fix the crisis. British ministers were pleased the G20 communique is specific on its commitments to try to find a mechanism to address unsustainable bonds costs. Ministers have been struck that within the eurozone there is a realisation that even with the Spanish banks' recapitalisation and a Greek election endorsing its previous bailout agreement, more needs to be done to address unsustainable bond yields (the interest paid on the debt). There were renewed signs that the fiscal crisis was intensifying on Tuesday after the Spanish government announced it would delay spelling out the full results of the independent audit of its crisis-hit banks until September. Madrid was granted a \u20ac100bn bailout from its European partners earlier this month to shore up its financial sector. But news that the full extent of the shortfall of the banks will not be known until the autumn underlined the sense of chaos. There was speculation that the full total required could end up being far more than \u20ac100bn. Madrid was forced to pay a record 5.07% at a debt auction on Tuesday morning to borrow \u20ac2.4bn for just 12 months, prompting analysts to say Spain is edging perilously close to needing a full-blown rescue. \"The decidedly elevated bond yield levels leave a question mark firmly in place as regards the sustainability of Spain's public finances while doing nothing to temper speculation as to how long the country might hold out before looking for a more comprehensive bailout,\" said Richard McGuire of Rabobank. British government sources were stressing that any steps taken to help on Spanish bond yields were not a substitute for longer-term reforms such as European banking union, fiscal integration and even political union. The chancellor, George Osborne, hinted at the possible deal saying the eurozone was inching towards solutions. He said: \"I think there are signs that the eurozone are moving towards richer countries standing behind their banks and standing behind the weaker countries. \"There is no doubt that they [the eurozone] realise that individual measures taken in individual countries \u2013 like recapitalising Spanish banks and getting a Greek government that is in favour of staying in the euro \u2013 are not by themselves enough.\" The G20 communique due to be issued later mentions \"steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration that lead to sustainable borrowing costs\". British officials are pleased that the lengthy passage on the eurozone makes specific forward-looking references to improving the functioning of financial markets and breaking the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks. It also speaks of the need for a more integrated financial architecture encompassing banking supervision and recapitalisation and deposit insurance. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2012.
