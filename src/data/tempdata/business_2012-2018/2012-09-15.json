    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Vince Cable's new bank underlines the truth: the lending system is failing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vince Cable's business investment bank, announced last week as part of the coalition's latest stab at an industrial strategy, was yet another desperate attempt to bypass the broken British banking system that remains one of the major obstacles to economic recovery. Project Merlin, the painfully choreographed deal between Cable, George Osborne and the biggest banks announced in February last year, was meant to result in a surge of new loans to small businesses; yet net lending continued to fall. Osborne used his autumn party conference speech last year to promise a new policy of \"credit easing\", launched as the National Loan Guarantee Scheme in March this year. Not all the banks agreed to participate; the negotiations with lenders about how they would pass on cheaper borrowing costs from the Treasury were long and fraught; and again, nothing happened. A few months later, at the annual Mansion House dinner, Osborne and Sir Mervyn King used their speeches to the black-tie-wearing dignitaries to announce yet another scheme, known as funding for lending (or FLS), aimed at cutting the cost of borrowing for the banks and persuading them to lend. It's too soon to say whether FLS is having an impact, since it was only launched in July \u2013 though there is some evidence in the housing market of a modest decline in mortgage rates, and a rise in loan-to-value ratios, as a result of government intervention. However, the fact that the Treasury is willing to countenance setting up a new state-backed institution to lend to businesses suggests there remains deep anxiety in Downing Street about the pace of business lending. And if companies are still struggling to borrow, it doesn't just matter because it puts jobs at risk and delays Britain's recovery in the short-term, but because the kind of adjustment the economy must make \u2013 from finance to industry, domestic consumption to exports \u2013 requires a radical transfer of resources. That can't happen if the financial plumbing is blocked. All the suggestions are that, just like another of Cable's cherished ideas, the Green Investment Bank, the new institution will be hemmed in by tight financial restrictions imposed by a nervous Treasury that believes governments should not be in banking. But a new report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), due to be published later this week, suggests that \u00a340bn would be the minimum size worth bothering with if the new bank is to make a serious difference to the economy, and urges Osborne to allow it to raise funds on capital markets to boost its lending power to \u00a3100bn. Like Cable, the IPPR's Tony Dolphin sees the bank as a solution to some of Britain's long-term economic problems, rather than a rapid cure for the slump. It could help to boost investment levels, for example, which are far too low in the UK relative to our international rivals, at just 15% of GDP. A state-backed bank could also take a more long-sighted approach than small firms are accustomed to seeing from high street lenders, with their computerised loan models and centralised management. So Cable is to be encouraged for floating the idea, and we should wish him luck as he tries to persuade the Treasury to be bold; but it also serves to underline the unfortunate truth that Britain's banking system is failing \u2013 and for two reasons. The first is a direct legacy of the boom-bust cycle of the past 10 years. The big four banks, which control an extraordinary 75% of the small business market, still have billions of pounds' worth of assets on their books from the happy-go-lucky days before the Great Recession, when they lent so freely to everyone from first-time buyers with no wage slips to show to the cash-strapped Greek and Spanish governments. The Bank of England's financial policy committee has expressed concern about what has popularly become known as \"extend and pretend\" \u2013 the banks' practice of showing lenience to borrowers who can't make repayments, rather than write down the value of their loans and face the knock-on effects across their balance sheets. That's a relief to struggling debtors, whether homeowners or companies; but the banks will remain reluctant to make new loans while they're loaded up with dodgy debts from the past. And it means the risk remains of another hugely costly taxpayer bailout if the economy fails to recover. Secondly, the flip side of Cable's argument \u2013 that a state-backed investment bank could take a longer-term approach and help to boost investment levels \u2013 is that despite Britain's banking sector being one of the largest relative to the size of the economy of any developed country, it has failed to channel savers' funds into productive, long-term investments that boost the economy's growth potential. Instead, as the work of the Cresc group of economists has shown, banks devoted themselves to recycling cash around the financial system \u2013 or, as Martin Wheatley, who will be boss of the new Financial Conduct Authority pointed out recently, trying to flog consumers risky products they didn't need. This government, like the last, has been far too timid in getting a grip on the style, culture and scale of British banking, despite owning a large part of the industry as a result of the bailouts of RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. All power to Cable's elbow \u2013 but building a shiny new lender with his name above the door won't give Britain's businesses the banks they deserve.",

      "body": "<p>Vince Cable's business investment bank, announced last week as part of the coalition's latest stab at an industrial strategy, was yet another desperate attempt to bypass the broken British banking system that remains one of the major obstacles to economic recovery.</p> <p>Project Merlin, the painfully choreographed deal between Cable, George Osborne and the biggest banks announced in February last year, was meant to result in a surge of new loans to small businesses; yet net lending continued to fall.</p> <p>Osborne used his autumn party conference speech last year to promise a new policy of \"credit easing\", launched as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/20/george-osborne-scheme-boost-lending\" title=\"\">National Loan Guarantee Scheme in March this year</a>. Not all the banks agreed to participate; the negotiations with lenders about how they would pass on cheaper borrowing costs from the Treasury were long and fraught; and again, nothing happened.</p> <p>A few months later, at the annual Mansion House dinner, Osborne and Sir Mervyn King used their speeches to the black-tie-wearing dignitaries to announce yet another scheme, known as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/13/george-osborne-funding-for-lending-scheme\" title=\"\"> funding for lending</a> (or FLS), aimed at cutting the cost of borrowing for the banks and persuading them to lend.</p> <p>It's too soon to say whether FLS is having an impact, since it was only launched in July \u2013 though there is some evidence in the housing market of a modest decline in mortgage rates, and a rise in loan-to-value ratios, as a result of government intervention.</p> <p>However, the fact that the Treasury is willing to countenance setting up a new state-backed institution to lend to businesses suggests there remains deep anxiety in Downing Street about the pace of business lending.</p> <p>And if companies are still struggling to borrow, it doesn't just matter because it puts jobs at risk and delays Britain's recovery in the short-term, but because the kind of adjustment the economy must make \u2013 from finance to industry, domestic consumption to exports \u2013 requires a radical transfer of resources. That can't happen if the financial plumbing is blocked.</p> <p>All the suggestions are that, just like another of Cable's cherished ideas, the Green Investment Bank, the new institution will be hemmed in by tight financial restrictions imposed by a nervous Treasury that believes governments should not be in banking.</p> <p>But a new report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), due to be published later this week, suggests that \u00a340bn would be the minimum size worth bothering with if the new bank is to make a serious difference to the economy, and urges Osborne to allow it to raise funds on capital markets to boost its lending power to \u00a3100bn.</p> <p>Like Cable, the IPPR's Tony Dolphin sees the bank as a solution to some of Britain's long-term economic problems, rather than a rapid cure for the slump. It could help to boost investment levels, for example, which are far too low in the UK relative to our international rivals, at just 15% of GDP. A state-backed bank could also take a more long-sighted approach than small firms are accustomed to seeing from high street lenders, with their computerised loan models and centralised management.</p> <p>So Cable is to be encouraged for floating the idea, and we should wish him luck as he tries to persuade the Treasury to be bold; but it also serves to underline the unfortunate truth that Britain's banking system is failing \u2013 and for two reasons.</p> <p>The first is a direct legacy of the boom-bust cycle of the past 10 years. The big four banks, which control an extraordinary 75% of the small business market, still have billions of pounds' worth of assets on their books from the happy-go-lucky days before the Great Recession, when they lent so freely to everyone from first-time buyers with no wage slips to show to the cash-strapped Greek and Spanish governments.</p> <p>The Bank of England's financial policy committee has expressed concern about what has popularly become known as \"extend and pretend\" \u2013 the banks' practice of showing lenience to borrowers who can't make repayments, rather than write down the value of their loans and face the knock-on effects across their balance sheets.</p> <p>That's a relief to struggling debtors, whether homeowners or companies; but the banks will remain reluctant to make new loans while they're loaded up with dodgy debts from the past.

    "webTitle": "AgustaWestland pins hopes on search and rescue deal to secure its future", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As BAE considers tying the knot with EADS in an age of dwindling public spending, another defence manufacturer, AgustaWestland, is also wondering how it will manage without the security of regular government orders. The only British military helicopter order for the next 15 years is being built in Somerset: the AW159 Wildcat that will be used across the armed forces, after a deal awarded in 2006 and worth \u00a31.7bn. But AgustaWestland, owned by Italian defence firm Finmeccanica, is one of many manufacturers that now need new markets to offset a loss of Ministry of Defence business. The \u00a337bn UK defence budget will be reduced by 8% by 2014, while future procurement deals will be \"off the shelf\", which means acquiring ready-made products that have already been sold elsewhere. That will be a challenge for domestic defence manufacturers, who insist they need the government to confer legitimacy on their products by ordering them. Only then are they likely to appeal to export buyers. For the Yeovil site to have a long-term future as a manufacturing base and become less defence-focused, the state retains a pivotal role. The Department for Transport is offering a 10-year contract for the UK search and rescue service, which will require new helicopters. AgustaWestland is hoping its AW189, tailored for non-military markets, will be selected. Graham Cole, AgustaWestland's chairman, has pledged to build the AW189 in the West Country, creating 1,300 jobs and hopefully \u00a32bn in exports if other countries note the AW189's success in its home market. The DfT is choosing from three private contractors which will, in turn, select a helicopter, so it is out of Cole's hands. But it is clear that a failure to win search and rescue business will raise serious questions over Yeovil's future as a manufacturing base. \"If the UK did not buy it, it would be difficult to sell elsewhere,\" says Cole. Yeovil's production lines are tailored around small orders for highly specified military aircraft. With defence spending under pressure globally \u2013 Cole \"cannot think of a new military helicopter in the world that is under design\" \u2013 AgustaWestland must move into the civil market. It hopes search and rescue will be the launchpad. \"There is an umbilical cord between government procurement policy and the health of the industry,\" says Cole. \"Here they have got a company that is world class and they do need to understand that decisions taken on major programmes have an impact for a long period of time.\" As well as the search and rescue contract, AgustaWestland is looking to secure an MoD deal to upgrade Apache helicopters, as well as money from the government's regional growth fund. If George Osborne needs the private sector to fill the gap left by reduced government spending, then Yeovil is an example of where the state needs to play a significant role for that transition to take place. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation the EEF, says the government has to give UK makers as much guidance as possible on upcoming procurement deals, because sizeable orders could create export windfalls. \"We need a more collaborative approach in terms of giving businesses a visibility of the pipeline of orders coming through. This can provide a platform for exports.\" AgustaWestland employs 3,500 people at Yeovil and some of the expertise onsite will be hard to retain if manufacturing atrophies \u2013 the implicit consequence of losing the search and rescue business. Joe Conway, a senior union representative, says Yeovil must retain its design and engineering skills: \"We don't want to end up as a nuts-and-bolts factory,\" he says. Some of those skills are on display in the rotor blade facility on the 220-acre site. Just 2mm thick at its carbon-fibre tip, the rotor blade for an AW101 looks incapable of coping with the aerodynamic forces it is built to withstand \u2013 let alone hostile elements, such as bullets fired by the Taliban. \"We have had all sorts of damage here,\" says Martin Kearvell, head of the blades facility. The slender-looking main rotor blade of the AW101 undulates and twists along its 10m length. This helps it mitigate four powerful forces: centrifugal force, which tries to pull the blades from the rotor hub; lag, which tries to pull them back; torsion, which twists them; and flap, which flexes them up and down. \"All those forces have to be overcome and you have to create lift as well,\" says Kearvell. In flight, the force exerted at the tip is in excess of 700G, travelling at just short of the speed of sound, at 750mph. Back in the hangar where the Wildcats are under construction, a 20-year-old apprentice, Matt Keen, says it has always been his dream to work here. Growing up nearby, he could \"hear all the helicopters flying around,\" he says, adding that he is excited by the prospect of working on new concepts such as the tiltrotor \u2013 a product that takes off as a helicopter but flies as a turboprop airplane. \"I would love to see what this place is like in 20 years' time,\" he says. But the answer is not entirely in AgustaWestland's hands.",

      "body": "<p>As BAE considers tying the knot with EADS in an age of dwindling public spending, another defence manufacturer, AgustaWestland, is also wondering how it will manage without the security of regular government orders.</p> <p>The only British military helicopter order for the next 15 years is being built in Somerset: the AW159 Wildcat that will be used across the armed forces, after a deal awarded in 2006 and worth \u00a31.7bn. But AgustaWestland, owned by Italian defence firm Finmeccanica, is one of many manufacturers that now need new markets to offset a loss of Ministry of Defence business.</p> <p>The \u00a337bn UK defence budget will be reduced by 8% by 2014, while future procurement deals will be \"off the shelf\", which means acquiring ready-made products that have already been sold elsewhere. That will be a challenge for domestic defence manufacturers, who insist they need the government to confer legitimacy on their products by ordering them. Only then are they likely to appeal to export buyers.</p> <p>For the Yeovil site to have a long-term future as a manufacturing base and become less defence-focused, the state retains a pivotal role. The Department for Transport is offering a 10-year contract for the UK search and rescue service, which will require new helicopters. AgustaWestland is hoping its AW189, tailored for non-military markets, will be selected.</p> <p>Graham Cole, AgustaWestland's chairman, has pledged to build the AW189 in the West Country, creating 1,300 jobs and hopefully \u00a32bn in exports if other countries note the AW189's success in its home market. The DfT is choosing from three private contractors which will, in turn, select a helicopter, so it is out of Cole's hands. But it is clear that a failure to win search and rescue business will raise serious questions over Yeovil's future as a manufacturing base.</p> <p>\"If the UK did not buy it, it would be difficult to sell elsewhere,\" says Cole. Yeovil's production lines are tailored around small orders for highly specified military aircraft. With defence spending under pressure globally \u2013 Cole \"cannot think of a new military helicopter in the world that is under design\" \u2013 AgustaWestland must move into the civil market. It hopes search and rescue will be the launchpad.</p> <p>\"There is an umbilical cord between government procurement policy and the health of the industry,\" says Cole. \"Here they have got a company that is world class and they do need to understand that decisions taken on major programmes have an impact for a long period of time.\"</p> <p>As well as the search and rescue contract, AgustaWestland is looking to secure an MoD deal to upgrade Apache helicopters, as well as money from the government's regional growth fund. If George Osborne needs the private sector to fill the gap left by reduced government spending, then Yeovil is an example of where the state needs to play a significant role for that transition to take place.</p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation the EEF, says the government has to give UK makers as much guidance as possible on upcoming procurement deals, because sizeable orders could create export windfalls. \"We need a more collaborative approach in terms of giving businesses a visibility of the pipeline of orders coming through.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The banner said it all: \"Imagine: disabled and poor.\" The sight of wheelchair-bound protesters demonstrating outside the Greek parliament against the latest round of cuts that Athens must enact in return for rescue loans reinforced the uncomfortable truth that, in the country where Europe's debt drama first began, the crisis is far from over. While politicians were fixated on Germany's constitutional court ratifying the eurozone bailout mechanism and the general elections in Holland last week, Greece's three-party coalition was locked in fraught negotiations over a new \u20ac12.5bn (\u00a310bn) austerity package. The cuts in disability benefits, ordered by debt inspectors from the \"troika\" of lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF, threw into sharp relief the tough process that the weakest member of the eurozone is being forced to suffer. For the first time in living memory, military personnel took to the streets alongside police officers, fire brigade officials, teachers and doctors as Greeks vowed to resist further pay and pension cuts that have already led to plummeting living standards. This week, before a general strike scheduled for 26 September \u2013 the 17th this year \u2013 judges will walk off the job, shaking one of the central pillars of Greek society. Nearly three years into the debt crisis, the mood among Greeks has shifted from one of bewilderment and shock, borne of seeing their seemingly robust economy collapse almost overnight, to fury and fear as poverty and panic spread. Increasingly, ordinary people are speaking of \"blood being spilled\" and even \"civil war\". After the hiatus of a long summer, there are few who doubt that Greece is about to enter an autumn of mass discontent as the endless efforts to keep bankruptcy at bay move into a menacing new phase. \"The situation is terrible,\" says Vassilis Grillas, a cab driver. \"Every day, I see people who are in an awful state, who can't pay their bills \u2013 who, like me, are afraid that their homes will be confiscated because we all owe so much more than we have. If they keep on pushing us like this, blood will be spilled. Everyone will revolt. There will be a mass uprising for sure.\" With about 1,000 jobs reportedly being axed every day, the statistics agency Elstat announced last week that unemployment had reached an unprecedented 23.6% \u2013 compared with 16.3% a year ago. The surge mirrors the dramatic decline in GDP in a country that has been plagued by recession for the past five years. On Friday, as eurozone finance ministers met in Cyprus, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, it became clear that Greece will have to wait at least six weeks before lenders decide whether it deserves the next \u20ac31.5bn instalment of aid, which is crucial to recapitalising Greek banks and the cash-starved economy. Deliberations over the loan, which was initially due in July, have put Athens's fragile coalition on tenterhooks. Despite the IMF and EU both signalling that Greece will be granted the two-year extension it has called for to implement unpopular fiscal adjustment policies, the parties supporting the three-month-old government still find themselves in a difficult position: all three campaigned on refusing to endorse austerity measures that hit the most vulnerable members of society hardest. As creditors continue to insist that painful cuts are the price of further aid, politicians from the Greek president downwards have voiced fears that Athens is being pushed too far. Last week, President Carolos Papoulias decried the policies, telling visiting Canadian officials: \"We've been given a merciless lashing. I think we have paid enough for our mistakes, and Europe must realise that it needs to help Greece.\" The normally mild-mannered octogenarian expressed concern that the foundations of Greek democracy were being imperilled. The sight of police and senior naval and army officers taking to the streets last week prompted government officials to voice similar fears. Some spoke privately of \"the quiet before the storm\" amid anxiety that the prevailing uncertainty has prompted a rise in extremism. The far-right Golden Dawn party is not only gaining in popularity but increasingly taking law and order into its own hands, with attacks on immigrants nationwide. Although there has been a discernible change in attitude towards Greece among fiscal hardliners in the EU led by Germany, the death spiral in which the economy finds itself \u2013 Greek debt still accounts for 166% of GDP \u2013 shows little sign of reversing. That has added to the mood of fury and fear, provoking criticism even among reform-minded Greeks of the troika and its policies. \"They don't seem to care about the country, all they seem to care about is balancing the current account and budget, re-financing debt that is non-sustainable,\" says Theodore Pelagidis, professor of economic analysis at Piraeus University. \"No attention is given to improving competitiveness or the production markets. These are home economics, not the economics that should be applied to a country.\"",

An article in the New York Times suggested that federal and state authorities were ready to launch an aggressive crackdown on the failure to monitor transactions, in a move aimed at flagging to financial institutions that weak compliance is unacceptable. Officials told the Times that regulators are close to taking action against JP Morgan, while other firms including Bank of America are also being investigated over perceived shortcomings when it comes to putting a check on money-laundering activities. It comes just months after a Senate committee roundly criticised HSBC for ignoring warning signs that it was being used by money launderers and drug cartels in Mexico. US politicians also accused HSBC of circumventing US sanctions on countries including Cuba and Iran \u2013 a charge that has also been levied against JP Morgan. The Senate report was also highly critical of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), stating that the regulator needed to take \"stronger action\" on banks that exercise poor anti-money laundering controls. The OCC is now leading the crackdown on non-compliant banks, according to the New York Times report. It suggested that a \"cease-or-desist\" order could be issued against JP Morgan in the coming months, forcing the bank to review its checks, and implement measures to firm up its safeguards. Prosecutors from the justice department and the Manhattan district attorney's office are also investigating lapses at a number of financial institutions, it was reported.
