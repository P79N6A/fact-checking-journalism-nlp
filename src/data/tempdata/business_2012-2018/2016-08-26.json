      "bodyText": "Drivers for Uber\u2019s food delivery service, UberEats, are planning to picket London restaurants as part of a protest over pay. Dozens of scooter and bicycle couriers descended on an Uber office in Bermondsey on Friday to demonstrate against dwindling pay deals, which they say have left some at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. During a noisy but peaceful protest, drivers chanted \u201cUber, shame on you\u201d and called on the company to pay the London living wage of a guaranteed \u00a39.40 per hour, plus costs. The dispute is the latest to hit the \u201cgig economy\u201d, where people in need of cash sign up for occasional jobs but do not receive guaranteed hours or other benefits of full-time employment. Rival delivery service Deliveroo was recently forced to abandon plans to impose new contracts on workers after a protest by its own couriers. Uber refused to meet a delegation of drivers, saying it would only speak to them individually \u2013 an offer that protest organiser Imran Siddiqui said amounted to \u201cdivide and rule\u201d tactics. Siddiqui, who claims he has been blocked from working for UberEats since organising the demonstration, said riders were now planning to take their campaign on the road, touring London restaurants and disrupting their business. Another worker, who asked to be referred to as Manou, said: \u201cIf the restaurants are not making money with UberEats, they\u2019ll use Deliveroo instead. Uber will have less drivers and customers if they don\u2019t listen to us.\u201d Mohammed Ali, 21, said: \u201cWe just want what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s right. We\u2019ve worked our arses off to get this company to where it is now, but we\u2019re just tools to them.\u201d Drivers said they were offered generous rates of up to \u00a320 an hour when UberEats launched. But pay has been slashed since then, which some say has left them earning below the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour for over-25s. UberEats drivers are paid a base fare of \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus \u00a31 per mile between the restaurant and the drop location, minus a 25% fee taken by the company. They also get an added \u201ctrip reward\u201d of \u00a34 per delivery in peak times and \u00a33 off-peak. Uber said this amounted to a minimum of \u00a313 per hour, assuming the driver makes two deliveries an hour. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to being the best option for couriers in London,\u201d said Alex Czarnecki, general manager of UberEats London. \u201cUnlike other companies, we don\u2019t set shifts, minimum hours or delivery zones \u2013 couriers can simply log in or out when and where they choose.\u201d He said couriers were earning \u201con average more than the London living wage\u201d. But pay records passed to the Guardian suggest they are at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. One courier\u2019s records show he earned just \u00a341.78 for seven hours and 19 minutes of work, equating to \u00a35.72 an hour. All drivers are self-employed, which means they do not receive holiday or sick pay, or any hourly wage while they wait for orders. The protest follows reports that Uber lost nearly $1.3bn in the first half of 2016. It blamed the loss partly on subsidies it pays to drivers.",

      "bodyText": "Fed chair Janet Yellen has told the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers that the case for rate rises has \u201cstrengthened\u201d but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d He fellow policymaker and vice chair Stanley Fischer followed up the speech with an interview where he highlighted a strengthening US economy and jobs market Stock markets initially trimmed gains on Yellen\u2019s speech, then recovered on relief that any rate rise could be some way off, only to drop again on Fischer\u2019s sanguine remarks US growth was revised slightly lower In the UK, the FTSE 100 has closed up 21 points, or 0.3%, at 6,838 Official UK data confirmed GDP grew 0.6% in the second quarter, with little evidence that the EU referendum at the end of the quarter had hurt investment. Consumer spending remained the main driver But economists warned that the second quarter figures would come to represent a high point for this year, with growth in the following months hit weaker business confidence on the back of the Brexit vote On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all the comments, we will be back on Tuesday. Here is CNBC\u2019s report on its interview with Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer, who gave markets more to mull over when he highlighted the US economy\u2019s recent strength. Hints that the Fed could raise rates as soon as next month, saw US stock markets erase earlier gains. Now Fed policymaker Stanley Fischer is talking about Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, adding fuel to the debate over whether the US central bank could raise rates as soon as September. He has been speaking to CNBC and appears to be hinting a near-term rate rise is still on the table. The dollar is strengthening and US stocks have trimmed gains. Here\u2019s a rather unsympathetic assessment of how financial markets reacted to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech from David Lamb, head of dealing a FEXCO Corporate Payments. He says traders are \u201cunable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces\u201d. Lamb comments: \u201cThe currency markets frequently live and die by the \u2018shoot first and ask questions later\u2019 motto. Today they were asking awkward questions just seconds after firing. \u201cNo sooner had the Fed\u2019s Chair uttered the magic words \u2018the case has strengthened\u2019 and trigger-happy traders were snapping up dollars in expectation of an near-immediate rate rise. \u201cBut as the seconds ticked by, it became increasingly clear that a hike is inevitable, but not imminent. \u201cCue a huge correction that saw the dollar slump well below its pre-announcement levels \u2013 leaving many traders unable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces. \u201cThe caveats came thick and fast. There\u2019s a range of possible rate rise scenarios, they could still be blown of course, and the killer line \u2013 gradual hikes are appropriate.\u201d US stock markets are rallying in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading company IG. He believes Yellen opted to \u201cplease both hawks and doves\u201d. Beauchamp comments: \u201cThe \u2018Dip-buyers anonymous\u2019 team is working at full steam this afternoon, as Janet Yellen finds the right tone to encourage investors to step back into the market at the end of a tedious week. Clearly a modest rise in rates is taken as a sign of confidence in the economy, while the passing reference to other policy measures being potentially necessary in future crises was viewed as leaving the door open to the kind of broader monetary stimulus practised by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\u201d Looking ahead, he adds: \u201cGiven the enthusiastic reception equity markets have given Janet Yellen, it looks like the steady grind higher will continue into the end of August.\u201d Andrew Hunter, US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics says Janet Yellen\u2019s comments are \u201cconsistent with a US rate hike by year-end\u201d. To re-cap, the Fed chair said the case for rate rises had strengthened, she rebuffed suggestions monetary policy had lost some of its power and made that now so familiar call from central bankers for fiscal policy to do its share of the heavy lifting. But there was little in the way of guidance on when US interest rates might rise and so markets were left doing a little dance that I would sum up - if readers will forgive the lack of sophistication - as \u201cOh no, rate hikes!!! Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered. Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. He continues: \u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome. \u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: \u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d He writes: \u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan. Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium was a pretty good effort.\u201d Full analysis following soon Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d. He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech. \u201cThe first of the main messages was that the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead. \u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation. \u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d \u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that rollercoaster market reaction to the speech by Janet Yellen. He comments: \u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish. She said the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. Also, the US economy continues to expand and has reached maximum employment with price stability. This saw the dollar pop higher initially and precious metals fall. Nevertheless, she anticipates that gradual rate hikes are appropriate... \u201cBut as is so often the case, the initial market reaction can be misleading. As traders scanned below the headlines for the meat in the speech, perceptions over Dr Yellen\u2019s thinking changed. Gold and silver have surged as the dollar slumped. Possibly this is connected to her comments that the overall economic situation remains uncertain.\u201d Janet Yellen has also used her speech to join the chorus of central bankers insisting they are not all out of ammunition. Her speech to the Jackson Hole meeting, entitled \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit: Past, Present, and Future\u201d, unsurprisingly concludes that it\u2019s a well-stocked and effective toolkit. Yellen says: \u201cAlthough fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy. New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who shortly after the EU referendum said: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view: \u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks. A move at the September meeting remains less likely but a move before year end now looks a distinct possibility should US data continue to improve.\u201d Some more reactions coming in to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech now, which as we noted earlier left the markets in a bit of a muddle. The dollar initially strengthened as the Fed chair hinted at further rate rises but then lost those gains, possibly as the timing of any such tightening seems to be some way off. Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments: \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit. \u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi. \u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already? Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen. US stocks initially trimmed gains only to rise again. The dollar has now reversed its initial gains against the pound and euro. Here are some of the early reactions (including from UK commentators, who are counting down to a long weekend with a public holiday on Monday): Those remarks on a stronger case for rate hikes in the US have seen US stock markets trim some of their gains and pushed the dollar up against the euro and pound. This key extract from the speech shows Janet Yellen and her fellow policymakers are still keen to come across as avid data watchers, but she clearly sees a better case for rate rises: \u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months. Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee\u2019s outlook,\u201d she said. Yellen has told her audience at Jackson Hole that the case for raising US interest rates has strengthened in recent months. She cited improvements in the jobs market and hopes for modest GDP growth. Here is the full speech. US markets are up in early trading as investors await Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. Twenty minutes to go. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 18,495 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,178 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,222 Before Janet Yellen speaks in less than an hour, there have been some important developments in the cruise liner industry. David Hasselhoff of Knight Rider and Baywatch fame will set sail on his first official fan cruise on 4 November next year. The six-day tour on Costa Favolosa will begin in Italy and call at various European ports. The ticket price starts at \u20ac599 (\u00a3513) and \u201cDavid is on board with you for the duration of the cruiser\u201d, apparently. Events will include a concert, a get-together with the Hoff, an autograph session and \u2013 an evening with David \u201cin the large theatre\u201d.... Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s have recalled some 500ml cartons of their Cookie Dough flavour ice cream over fears they might contain small pieces of metal. Four batches are thought to have been affected and UK customers have been asked to check batch numbers printed at the bottom of their pots. The ice-cream maker advised customers to throw the product away if it was from one of the batches. It said in a safety notice: The company has identified a specific production period during which Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough 500ml may have been affected and, as safety remains a top priority, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s is voluntarily recalling four batch codes of Cookie Dough 500ml from sale. As a precaution, everyone with a 500ml tub of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough in their freezers at home should check the batch number on the bottom of their tub to make sure it\u2019s not affected. And, if it matches the batch numbers listed above, they should not eat the product and, instead, we ask them to discard the product in the usual household bin. (The batch codes affected are L62110L011, L62111L011, L62112L011 and L62113L011.) Fancy an ice cream anyone? Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, thinks Janet Yellen should take a cautious approach to her Jackson Hole speech, which is coming up in a hour an a quarter. Smith says: Yellen will do her best to sound upbeat on the US economy, but not to tie her hands into tightening policy this year. The Fed has led the market down the garden path once too often on this front, not least at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole summit, so she\u2019d do well to keep her options open this time and not cause a similar furore this year.\u201d He adds makes the point that central bankers are running out of rope when it comes to monetary policy stimulus: The issue is that monetary policy is reaching its limits, even the various forms of quantitative easing and negative interest rates being imposed. This is most true for Japan and the eurozone. That may encourage central bankers to be even more aggressive in their approach, but there are always unintended consequences. This is certainly true in the eurozone, given the costs that negative rates impose on banks and (increasingly) their customers. US GDP growth for the second quarter has been revised down a touch to an annual rate of 1.1%, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%. The second estimate from the US Commerce Department was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters. It followed 0.8% growth in the first quarter. European markets remain subdued as we await Yellen\u2019s speech. The FTSE 100 is down just three points at 6,820. It\u2019s a similar story across Europe, with the STOXX 600 index down 0.1 points to 341.9. Earlier in Japan, figures showed consumer prices fell for the fifth month in a row in July, dealing a blow to prime minister Shinzo Abe and his bid to combat deflation. Annual deflation deepened last month, with consumer prices falling by 0.5% in the year to July. It followed a 0.4% drop in June and was the biggest fall in more than three years as businesses delayed price hikes because of weak demand. The data will intensify the pressure on Japan\u2019s central bank to announce more stimulus, on top of the huge amount of money it has already pumped into the world\u2019s third largest economy. Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics: While economic activity is on the mend, the slump in import prices suggests that underlying inflation will continue to fall in coming months. The Bank of Japan will find it increasingly difficult to blame falling energy prices for the decline in overall consumer prices. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, says investors will be looking to this afternoon\u2019s US GDP number, as well as Yellen\u2019s speech, for clues about the timing of the next rate rise. Strong data combined with a hawkish Yellen could see the dollar rally as August comes to a close and markets look towards the [rate-setting] FOMC meeting in September. The Fed are relying on strong economic data to advocate a long anticipated rate hike so data over the last half of 2016 is crucial to both markets and the Fed in determining the direction of policy and markets. We are at a crucial point in the course of monetary policy for the Fed and data points are more pertinent than ever. Markus Allenspach, head of fixed income research at Julius Baer, says Yellen is unlikely to give any clear signals about September\u2019s Fed meeting: For weeks already, the market is waiting anxiously for Yellen\u2019s speech, as members of the Federal Reserve often presented conflicting views in the public about the necessity and timing of rate hikes. We doubt, however, that Yellen will give clear directions today; in her view, monetary policy decisions are taken by the FOMC as a committee. Esther George, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and host of the Jackson Hole meeting, has been speaking to Bloomberg from the event. Having already voted against the majority for a rate rise, she suggests she\u2019ll vote again for higher rates at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. When I look at where we are with the job market, when I look at inflation and our forecasts for that, I think it\u2019s time to move. Where it will look by the September meeting we\u2019ll have to wait and see if anything changes fundamentally. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s speech, traders are forecasting a one in three chance of a US rate rise in September. Back to the main event of the day in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Once Friday\u2019s proceedings get underway at Jackson Lake Lodge, we won\u2019t have long to wait for Janet Yellen\u2019s speech as the chair of the US Federal Reserve is first up at 8am Mountain Time (3pm in the UK). The meeting runs from 8am to 2pm on both Friday and Saturday, with a series of papers presented, speeches given, and discussions held. As Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor put it, \u201cJackson Hole is Davos for central bankers\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s Minouche Shafik will give a speech titled adapting to changes in the financial market landscape at 3.50pm UK time. Other topics up for discussion on Friday include negative interest rates, and \u201calternative monetary frameworks\u201d. The main topic on Saturday is central bank balance sheets. The full agenda is published here. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says predictions of a self-inflicted Brexit recession are overdone. An uncertainty-driven slowdown still seems likely. But with a number of recent surveys from the CBI and others showing bouncebacks from post-vote lows, strong official retail sales numbers for July, and the support offered by the package of measures announced by the Bank of England, predictions that the economy will fall into recession look unduly pessimistic. The pound is up slightly against the dollar at $1.3203 (+0.1%). It is flat against the euro at \u20ac1.688. UK data this week has generally been better-than-expected and a survey published overnight by YouGov/Cebr showed a surge in consumer confidence in August. The headline index increased 3.2 points to 109.8 in August. It was the biggest monthly jump since February 2013 after the economy performed better than expected. The August rise followed a sharp drop in July, suggesting initial shock and fears over the June Brexit vote subsided this month. YouGov interviews about 6,000 consumers a month, asking them about their household finances, property prices, job security and business activity in the workplace. The only indicator to show a drop in August was job security over the next 12 months. Here is the Guardian\u2019s full story on the second estimate of Q2 growth, which was confirmed at 0.6%: Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics is decidedly gloomy about the outlook for the UK economy. He says consumers will start to feel the pinch from rising inflation next year: Looking ahead, consumers might be able to maintain strong growth in their spending for another quarter, but when inflation picks up in earnest early next year and firms follow through on plans to freeze hiring, they will have to slow down. Meanwhile, the slight rise in business investment in Q2 provides little reassurance about the post-referendum outlook, since few businesses anticipated the Leave vote and surveys suggest firms are recoiling from major financial commitments in Q3. As a result, we continue to see a high risk that the economy enters a mild recession over the coming quarters. Deloitte\u2019s chief economist Ian Stewart, says the consumer recovery is going strong: The UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery. Scott Bowman at Capital Economics, says the Brexit vote will weigh on growth in the second half of the year: UK households shrugged off pre-referendum uncertainty, driving an acceleration in GDP growth in the second quarter. Looking ahead, growth looks set to slow significantly in the second half of the year as uncertainty related to the Brexit vote takes its toll. We think that growth will fall to around zero in Q3 and Q4, mainly due to falls in business investment. Here are three key charts from the second estimate of Q2 growth, which came in at 0.6%... 1. The UK economy has grown every quarter since the first quarter of 2013: 2. On the output side of the economy, only the services sector is back above pre-crisis levels: 3. Households shrugged off uncertainty in the run-up to the 23 June referendum, as consumer spending continued to be a key driver of growth: Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS has commented on this mornings figures which confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. Today\u2019s figures reinforce the picture that the economy grew strongly in April, and then remained relatively flat in May and June. Business investment grew in the second quarter, partly thanks to companies spending on transport equipment such as cars and planes. However, levels of investment remained lower than at the same period last year. Our survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP. The ONS says there is no sign in the GDP data that uncertainty in the run-up to the EU referendum affected investment. The second estimate of growth (confirmed at 0.6%) gives a more detailed picture of how different parts of the economy performed between April and June. Specifically it shed some light on the spending side. Business investment increased by 0.5% over the quarter, beating expectations of a 0.8% fall and a 0.6% fall in the first quarter. Household spending was the strongest in almost two years in the second quarter, up 0.9% from 0.7% in the first quarter. In terms of output, services growth was confirmed at 0.5% and industrial output growth was confirmed at 2.1%. Construction output was revised down however, falling by 0.7% and not 0.4% as initially thought. Growth of 0.6% in the second quarter has been confirmed by the Office for National Statistics. More soon. French consumer confidence ticked up in August, to 97 from 96 in July. It followed a drop in confidence in the previous two months according to the INSEE figures. Confidence among households about their personal finance situation improved sharply, jumping seven points to highest level since October 2007. The French economy was flat in the second quarter, a second estimate of GDP from the statistics office INSEE showed. Zero growth between April and June followed 0.7% growth in the first quarter. INSEE said there was a sharp slowdown in household spending, while trade made a positive contribution after imports fell more than exports. There is little movement in European markets this morning as investors await Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. They will be looking for clues from the Fed chair about whether to expect the next rise in US interest rates in September, December, or 2017. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,802 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 10,537 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,409 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 16,587 Spain\u2019s IBEX: 0.3% at 8,623 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.03% at 342 The Jackson Hole economic symposium has been hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1978. Representing the Bank of England are Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking, and Kristin Forbes, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, will not attend. Also coming up today... We will get the second estimate of UK growth in the second-quarter from the Office for National Statistics. Economists polled expect growth to be confirmed at 0.6%. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says there is a risk that the number could be revised lower, \u201cparticularly since we did see some evidence of a slowdown in late May and June as the referendum date approached\u201d. The latest estimate will provide more details on how the different parts of the economy performed between April and June. So far the consumer side of the economy appears to have held up well since the Brexit vote on 23 June, but those numbers as well as business investment figures will be closely scrutinised in the coming months for signs of waning confidence. In the US (before Yellen speaks at 3pm UK time) we will get the second estimate of Q2 growth from the world\u2019s largest economy. European markets are expected to open slightly lower this morning as traders pause for breath before Yellen\u2019s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The day has finally arrived. At 8am Mountain Time, or 3pm UK time, the chair of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen will deliver her keenly anticipated speech at the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium. The event is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and got underway last night with a reception and dinner at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. The full agenda for the meeting of the world\u2019s central bankers can be found here. This year\u2019s theme is Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future. But the main event awaited by investors all week is Yellen\u2019s speech. The title of the speech is The Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit, but traders and commentators will be looking specifically for any hints on the timing of the next Fed rate rise. This is what markets have been waiting for all week. We will bring you commentary in the run-up to the speech, the speech itself, and reaction thereafter. Thank you for joining us.",

Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers.

New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech915.pdf\">shortly after the EU referendum said</a>: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05244e4b09fcabd06c911\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:30:20.880Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view:</p> <p>\u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates a second time in one year in the coming months, chair Janet Yellen said on Friday. Delivering her annual speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in Wyoming, Yellen said gradual increases in interest rates were \u201cappropriate\u201d and the case for another had \u201cstrengthened\u201d. \u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cOf course, our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the committee\u2019s outlook.\u201d According to Andrew Hunter of the consultancy Capital Economics, Yellen\u2019s remarks and recent economic data improve the odds of a September rate hike. The odds will improve further still if the US economy adds 180,000 or more jobs this month, he said. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policy-setting branch of the Fed, has met five times this year; each time, its members voted to hold off on raising interest rates. Minutes from the most recent meeting revealed concern over Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and a potential slowdown in job creation. \u201cSeveral long-term global risks related to Brexit remained,\u201d the minutes noted. In Jackson Hole, Yellen noted that in the absence of hikes, interest rates have remained historically low, which could hinder the Fed\u2019s ability to fight recession in the near future. By lowering interest rates, the Fed provides an incentive for businesses and consumers to take out loans and to spend money, thus fueling the economy. But as interest rates are already low, the Fed may not be able to lower them as far as it might have in the past. \u201cForecasts now show the federal funds rate settling at about 3% in the longer run,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIn contrast, the federal funds rate averaged more than 7% between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.\u201d She ended by saying that despite historically low interest rates, \u201cmonetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively\u201d. Earlier this month, 95 economists polled by Reuters said there was only a 25% chance of a rise in September, and most expected just one rate hike this year. The Fed is set to meet in September, October and December, the month seen as most likely for the next hike. Last December, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, bringing the interest rate range to 0.25%-0.50%. James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, said on Friday he was agnostic on when the next rate hike might come. \u201cI do like to move on good news about the economy,\u201d he said in a CNBC interview. \u201cIf we got to a meeting and we felt things were looking stronger, that might be a good time to do that.\u201d Bullard that while the labor market was \u201cpretty strong\u201d and there had been a couple of good jobs reports recently, US GDP remained low. On Friday, the Department of Commerce announced that during the second quarter the economy grew at a rate of 1.1% \u2013 up from 0.8% in the first quarter but lower than the expected 1.2%. Hunter, of Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d On Thursday, some Fed members met with activists from the pressure group Fed Up, who have been attending the Jackson Hole meeting. Wearing green shirts that read \u201cWe need a people\u2019s Fed\u201d, activists called on the central bank to hold off raising interest rates and focus instead on driving down unemployment rates for black and Latino Americans.

The odds will improve further still if the US economy adds 180,000 or more jobs this month, he said.</p> <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policy-setting branch of the Fed, has met five times this year; each time, its members voted to hold off on raising interest rates. Minutes from the most recent meeting revealed concern over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union</a> and a potential slowdown in job creation. \u201cSeveral long-term global risks related to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit remained</a>,\u201d the minutes noted.</p> <p>In Jackson Hole, Yellen noted that in the absence of hikes, interest rates have remained historically low, which could hinder the Fed\u2019s ability to fight recession in the near future. By lowering interest rates, the Fed provides an incentive for businesses and consumers to take out loans and to spend money, thus fueling the economy. But as interest rates are already low, the Fed may not be able to lower them as far as it might have in the past. </p> <p>\u201cForecasts now show the federal funds rate settling at about 3% in the longer run,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIn contrast, the federal funds rate averaged more than 7% between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.\u201d </p> <p>She ended by saying that despite historically low interest rates, \u201cmonetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, 95 economists <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-economy-poll-usa-idUSKCN10M1FI\">polled by Reuters</a> said there was only a 25% chance of a rise in September, and most expected just one rate hike this year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rise in consumer spending helped the UK economy power ahead in the months running up to the EU referendum, with little sign the vote hurt investment or the wider economy, official statisticians have said. The Office for National Statistics confirmed a previous estimate that GDP growth picked up to 0.6% in the second quarter from 0.4% in the first quarter. The figures will be a boost to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has repeatedly asserted that Britain entered the post-referendum period from a position of strength. But economists said the second quarter would come to represent a high point for this year, with growth set to grind to a halt over coming months as the EU vote hurts business confidence. Much will hinge on how consumers fare over coming months. Signs since the referendum suggest households suffered an initial drop in sentiment but carried on spending. Commenting on the latest GDP figures, Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cThe UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery.\u201d The ONS also noted there had been little effect on the wider economy in the run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June. The April-to-June figures included data for a short period after the vote. The ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures reinforce the picture that the economy grew strongly in April, and then remained relatively flat in May and June. \u201cBusiness investment grew in the second quarter, partly thanks to companies spending on transport equipment such as cars and planes. However, levels of investment remained lower than at the same period last year. \u201cOur survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP.\u201d The statistics office provided more detail on what drove growth in this GDP update, with business investment rebounding 0.5% in the second quarter, compared with a fall of 0.6% in the first quarter. Household spending rose 0.9% after a rise of 0.7% in the first quarter. It was the strongest quarterly growth in spending for almost two years and adds to evidence that strong employment, low interest rates and low inflation are buoying consumer sentiment. In year-on-year terms, household spending was up 3%, the strongest growth since the end of 2007, before the financial crisis. Business investment was down 0.8% on a year earlier. Overall GDP was up 2.2% on the year. The strength in consumer demand contrasted with another disappointing quarter for trade. Net trade continued to drag on GDP growth as the gap between exports and imports widened further in the second quarter. Exports edged up 0.1% in the second quarter but imports grew by a much stronger 1%. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said there was a chance exporters would get a boost from the drop in the pound since the referendum, which makes UK goods more competitive overseas. But it was not clear how soon that would happen. \u201cTrade has weighed heavily on growth every year since 2011and the first half of 2016 suggests a turnaround is not likely, unless the post-referendum fall in sterling has an unusually quick and fast impact,\u201d he said. The 0.6% headline figure was as most City economists had been expecting, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll taken last week. But many expect growth will slow in this July to September quarter. There were already signs that the economy was losing momentum before the vote, based on figures for individual months in the second quarter, said Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics. The consultancy expects growth to fall to zero in the third and fourth quarters of this year. \u201cAdmittedly, consumer spending appears to have held up fairly well since the referendum. But survey measures of business activity have taken large hits and a significant portion of firms say they will invest less as a result of the Brexit vote,\u201d he said. Nina Skero, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, highlighted potential pressures on consumers. \u201cWhether consumers will continue to spend at the same level in 2017 is rather uncertain. A weaker pound will translate into more expensive imports and therefore higher inflation. As many companies either postpone hiring or freeze wages in response to increased uncertainty, the labour market will also cool somewhat. Finally, slower house price growth or even price declines will weigh on consumer confidence,\u201d she said.",

It was the strongest quarterly growth in spending for almost two years and adds to evidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">strong employment, low interest rates and low inflation are buoying consumer sentiment</a>. <br></p> <p>In year-on-year terms, household spending was up 3%, the strongest growth since the end of 2007, before the financial crisis. Business investment was down 0.8% on a year earlier. Overall GDP was up 2.2% on the year.</p> <p>The strength in consumer demand contrasted with another disappointing quarter for trade. Net trade continued to drag on GDP growth as the gap between exports and imports widened further in the second quarter. Exports edged up 0.1% in the second quarter but imports grew by a much stronger 1%.</p> <p>Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said there was a chance exporters would get a boost from the drop in the pound since the referendum, which makes UK goods more competitive overseas. But it was not clear how soon that would happen.</p> <p>\u201cTrade has weighed heavily on growth every year since 2011and the first half of 2016 suggests a turnaround is not likely, unless the post-referendum fall in sterling has an unusually quick and fast impact,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The 0.6% headline figure was as most City economists had been expecting, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll taken last week. But many expect growth will slow in this July to September quarter.<br></p> <p>There were already signs that the economy was losing momentum before the vote, based on figures for individual months in the second quarter, said Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics. The consultancy expects growth to fall to zero in the third and fourth quarters of this year.</p> <p>\u201cAdmittedly, consumer spending appears to have held up fairly well since the referendum. But survey measures of business activity have taken large hits and a significant portion of firms say they will invest less as a result of the Brexit vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nina Skero, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, highlighted potential pressures on consumers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhether consumers will continue to spend at the same level in 2017 is rather uncertain. A weaker pound will translate into more expensive imports and therefore higher inflation. As many companies either postpone hiring or freeze wages in response to increased uncertainty, the labour market will also cool somewhat. Finally, slower house price growth or even price declines will weigh on consumer confidence,\u201d she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "Is the summer blockbuster dead? Certainly, compared with summers past, this year\u2019s crop of big-budget, saturation-marketed summer films has been dismal. None of this summer\u2019s releases has enjoyed anything like the $200m opening three days of 2015\u2019s Jurassic World. This year\u2019s most impressive offering has been Captain America: Civil War, but it fell some $10m shy of last year\u2019s second-biggest summer hit, Avengers: Age of Ultron, which grossed $191m in its first three days, according to Box Office Mojo, although Civil War was released in April. At least the third Captain America film was well-received by critics. The same can\u2019t be said for Warner Brothers\u2019 Suicide Squad, which was so widely panned \u2013 including by this newspaper, which gave it two stars \u2013 that its fans tried to shut down the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Batman vs Superman, also by Warner Brothers, suffered a similar fate. To be fair they did debut with reasonable opening weekends. Others, like the much-hyped sequels to Independence Day and Johnny Depp\u2019s Alice in Wonderland, as well as Disney\u2019s live-action Tarzan reboot, all debuted damply and then continued to limp on at the box office. The season ended with the catastrophic flop of the remade biblical epic Ben-Hur, starring Jack Huston and Morgan Freeman. It brought in an embarrassingly bad $11m over its first weekend and could wind up making a $100m loss, the same amount it cost to make. Tom Nunan, a lecturer at the UCLA school of theater, film and television, and the founder of independent film and TV production company Bull\u2019s Eye Entertainment, says that the metric to look for is \u201cfall-off\u201d of audiences a few days after a movie opens. A sophisticated promotional campaign can get a film a decent opening few days, but, he says, the problem is, they don\u2019t sustain, and the reason for that is audience rejection between opening and second weekend. \u201cIf a movie falls off more than 55% weekend to weekend, it\u2019s a huge problem, and that\u2019s been the problem this summer: giant drop-offs, 60, 70% and higher. That shows complete rejection.\u201d \u201cNot only is performance lacklustre with these blockbuster franchises, but there\u2019s a general feeling that the poor performance is deserved, because the quality of the films doesn\u2019t hold up,\u201d Nunan continues. Studios today make far fewer films than they have in previous eras, and now focus more and more resources on a smaller number of huge-budget properties. \u201cMore and more is riding on fewer and fewer pictures \u2013 it becomes distressing,\u201d says Jonathan Kuntz, a film historian at UCLA\u2019s school of theater, film and television. \u201cA lot is riding on every roll of the dice here.\u201d On top of that, Kuntz says, is a similar problem to the one already faced by the music industry. \u201cThe marketplace and audience is much more fragmented than it used to be.\u201d In the classic era, everyone saw Gone With The Wind or Casablanca, but that is no longer the case. \u201cPeople are not going down every Friday to the local multiplex, so you have to do something blockbusterish to get their attention. And it costs a lot of money to market films these days,\u201d he says. High-budget, boutique and on-demand television dramas such as Game of Thrones are also putting pressure on the marketplace; DVD sales, once as big an earner for Hollywood as box office takings, have collapsed completely. \u201cEach film costs so darn much; you\u2019re risking $150-$200m. There\u2019s so far you can fall, so many ways to fail,\u201d Kuntz says. Box office figures are variable and there\u2019s a lot of noise in the signal. 2014 was also a relatively dry year for big summer blockbusters; and overall box office take is up slightly in 2016, though some of that can be attributed to a rise in ticket prices, according to Tucker Tooley, a Hollywood producer and CEO of Tooley Productions. There\u2019s also the fact that Star Wars: The Force Awakens was still playing in theaters for the first quarter of the year. \u201cTo me, the big question is: where are the young males,\u201d Tooley says. \u201cThey have become harder and harder over the last few years to persuade to come out, and the tentpole movies have always relied on them to be profitable. There\u2019s some degree of sequel-itis; [the audience has] become more selective. But the good news is, you\u2019ve got movies like Deadpool that get that audience active again,\u201d he says, referring to Fox\u2019s surprise hit earlier this year. The film, about Ryan Reynolds\u2019s motormouth assassin, took $132m in its opening weekend on its way to box office receipts of $400m \u2013 record-breaking for an R-rated movie. His message is that movies just have to be better to bring out big audiences: \u201cThe bar has just been raised in terms of presenting something that feels fresh and unique. \u201cI would say that the audience can smell a unique, good proposition,\u201d he says, \u201cand when they can, they show up. If not, then it\u2019s much harder to get them.\u201d The good news is that it is becoming impossible for studios to remain unaware of this. \u201cA totally fresh movie like Deadpool resonates.\u201d \u201c[It was] well done and unique, new and fresh-feeling. I would say there\u2019s no way that producers, writers, directors, and studios aren\u2019t all taking note of that.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson described it as the \u201cbest stunt ever\u201d. On the September day in 1999 that the London Eye was due to be erected, the giant ferris wheel could not be lifted off the ground. Branson saw an opportunity to get one over on an old rival. British Airways owned a third of the London Eye and was going to be the title sponsor. \u201cI was woken up at 5.30 one morning to be told that the BA-sponsored London Eye had a technical problem \u2013 they couldn\u2019t erect it,\u201d Branson later said. \u201cThey had the world\u2019s press waiting to see it going up and I knew we had a duty to give them something to look at.\u201d So, Branson scrambled an airship to fly over the site. It bore the slogan: \u201cBA can\u2019t get it up!!\u201d Unsurprisingly, the blimp generated significant attention in the media and went on to win a string of marketing awards. The stunt is a reminder of the public battle that has raged between Virgin and BA since Branson launch his airline Virgin Atlantic in 1984. The companies were top of the news agenda again this week. On Tuesday, British Airways flew back Team GB from the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The VIP aircraft was named victoRIOus and was decorated with a gold nosecone and the slogan #greattobeBAck. Photos of the British Airways aircraft adorned the front pages of newspapers and websites. On the same day, Virgin Trains released a statement and CCTV images disputing a claim from Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, that a train he had been on from London to Newcastle was overcrowded and he had been unable to find a seat. Branson also tweeted out the statement and images. If you were being cynical, you would point out that Virgin\u2019s statement on Corbyn helped to divert attention away from BA flying Britain\u2019s athletes back home. It took Virgin a week to respond to Corbyn\u2019s comments. Mark Borkowski, a PR expert and founder and creative director at Borkowski, says Branson would have been reeling about BA flying back the Olympic team. \u201cThey [BA] certainly squeezed the living daylights out of bringing home the Olympic team,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was manna from heaven, and I am sure Branson would have loved to be the carrier. He would have been there, carrying the champagne. He is a showman. \u201cThat was a commercial deal, fixed with the chief executive of the Olympic team. It is a no brainer for Team GB to be brought back on BA. But I would have thought Branson would have been watching that with a tear in his eyes, because he would have done it a lot better.\u201d Borkowski says that Virgin Trains may have timed their statement to coincide with the coverage that BA\u2019s flight was getting, but that it was also important to respond to Corbyn\u2019s criticism. \u201cYou could say that. Of course you are looking at acres and acres of phenomenal press where the brand has done a deal with the Olympic team and has hit the jackpot. He would have loved to have done that with Virgin, I am sure. \u201cThe two things [Olympics and Corbyn criticism] have created a perfect storm. I think the way the Corbyn thing played was to stop that growing and not allow Jeremy Corbyn to take the initiative.\u201d Virgin sources say that it took a week to respond to Corbyn because the company had to trawl through the CCTV footage and establish what had taken place. When it came, the response was a reminder of Branson\u2019s aggressive approach to public relations and marketing. \u201cHe is a showman, he is a risk-taker and few people have stood up and created the rock\u2019n\u2019roll CEO. He did, he invented it,\u201d Borkowski says. Branson\u2019s attempts to promote Virgin and take on BA have included carrying Kate Moss and Pamela Anderson on the wings of a Virgin Atlantic plane, dressing as a Zulu warrior for the launch of flights to South Africa, and putting the Union flag on the tailfin of all Virgin Atlantic planes after BA caused national uproar in 1997 by calling the flag \u201cremote and aloof\u201d and replacing it with multicoloured images. From the start, Branson promoted Virgin Atlantic as the brash, young challenger to BA and the establishment. This was not just through advertising though, with the pair becoming embroiled in a series of bitter legal battles. The rivalry really intensified in the early 1990s. The competition authorities ruled that BA was too dominant at Heathrow airport so handed Virgin Atlantic some of its prized slots as well as lucrative services to Tokyo. This opened the door for Branson\u2019s airline to become an established long-haul carrier, with Virgin Atlantic moving its base from Gatwick to Heathrow as a result. Lord King, the then boss of BA, was furious with these developments. He had overseen the privatisation of the airline and ensured that its dominance was protected. Now, however, he was having to deal with a new rival in Branson. King cancelled BA\u2019s donations to the Conservative party in protest. The BA boss was also irked when Britons stranded in the Gulf by Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait were airlifted to safety by Branson\u2019s airline rather than the national flagcarrier. As BA\u2019s frustration grew, King allegedly told his lieutenants to \u201cdo something about Branson\u201d. Two years later, BA had to pay damages of more than \u00a3600,000 to Branson and Virgin as well as legal costs of \u00a33m after an alleged \u201cdirty tricks\u201d campaign against the tycoon and his airline. Branson had accumulated evidence of BA poaching customers, tampering with confidential files, and leaking anti-Virgin stories. Eventually, BA apologised and admitted to \u201cdisreputable business practice\u201d in the high court. Howard Wheeldon, aviation analyst, says: \u201cTo say John King was obsessed with the threat of competition would be an understatement \u2013 the obvious rivalry between him and Richard Branson was of a kind that I had personally never experienced before, or indeed since. It was a bad kind of rivalry that turned into what I believe was really a secret obsession by John King to damage Virgin. \u201cAs an example, I remember Lord King speaking at the Aviation Club once and the following month Richard Branson speaking as well. Lord King and his entourage also attended the Branson lunch but as he was being introduced to the lunch audience King and his entourage got up and all walked out.\u201d After a brief truce following the departure of King, in 2006 Virgin Atlantic reported to the US and UK competition authorities that it had talked with BA about price-fixing fuel surcharges. Virgin Atlantic won immunity in the investigation that followed, while BA was eventually fined \u00a3270m by the UK\u2019s Office of Fair Trading and the US Department of Justice, although these were subsequently reduced and a criminal trial of four BA executives accused of conspiring with Virgin Atlantic collapsed. Financially, BA has continued to outperform Virgin Atlantic by posting larger profits and holding a larger market share. Branson has pumped money into Virgin Atlantic after selling other assets, such as Virgin Records in 1992, and sold a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines in 1999 which was later sold on to Delta. This has not dampened the rivalry, however. In 2012, around the time of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s deal with Delta, Willie Walsh, the boss of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, bet Branson a \u201cknee in the groin\u201d that in five years time Branson would not hold 51% of the airline. \u201cWe\u2019ve got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but I\u2019m confident it would be the other way around on this occasion,\u201d Branson replied. So if the tycoon is still there in a year\u2019s time, the rivalry between Virgin and BA could take another bizarre twist.",

Branson saw an opportunity to get one over on an old rival. British Airways <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/nov/11/britishairways.travelnews\">owned a third of the London Eye and was going to be the title sponsor.</a></p> <p>\u201cI was woken up at 5.30 one morning to be told that the BA-sponsored London Eye had a technical problem \u2013 they couldn\u2019t erect it,\u201d Branson later said. \u201cThey had the world\u2019s press waiting to see it going up and I knew we had a duty to give them something to look at.\u201d</p> <p>So, Branson scrambled an airship to fly over the site. It bore the slogan: \u201cBA can\u2019t get it up!!\u201d<br></p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the blimp generated significant attention in the media and went on to win a string of marketing awards.</p> <p>The stunt is a reminder of the public battle that has raged between Virgin and BA since Branson launch his airline Virgin Atlantic in 1984.<br></p> <p>The companies were top of the news agenda again this week. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\">British Airways flew back Team GB from the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro</a>.

Branson also tweeted out the statement and images.</p> <p>If you were being cynical, you would point out that Virgin\u2019s statement on Corbyn helped to divert attention away from BA flying Britain\u2019s athletes back home. It took Virgin a week to respond to Corbyn\u2019s comments.<br></p> <p>Mark Borkowski, a PR expert and founder and creative director at Borkowski, says Branson would have been reeling about BA flying back the Olympic team.</p> <p>\u201cThey [BA] certainly squeezed the living daylights out of bringing home the Olympic team,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was manna from heaven, and I am sure Branson would have loved to be the carrier. He would have been there, carrying the champagne. He is a showman.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a commercial deal, fixed with the chief executive of the Olympic team. It is a no brainer for Team GB to be brought back on BA. But I would have thought Branson would have been watching that with a tear in his eyes, because he would have done it a lot better.\u201d</p> <p>Borkowski says that Virgin Trains may have timed their statement to coincide with the coverage that BA\u2019s flight was getting, but that it was also important to respond to Corbyn\u2019s criticism. </p> <p>\u201cYou could say that. Of course you are looking at acres and acres of phenomenal press where the brand has done a deal with the Olympic team and has hit the jackpot. He would have loved to have done that with Virgin, I am sure. </p> <p>\u201cThe two things [Olympics and Corbyn criticism] have created a perfect storm.

Data from market researchers Nielsen showed that spending at bargain stores totalled \u00a34.9bn in the year to July, up 17% from the previous year. Nearly four-fifths of households in Britain (78%) now buy from them, with more than half shopping at Poundland alone.

Poundland, Poundworld, 99p Stores (now owned by Poundland), Poundstretcher, B&amp;M and Home Bargains were included in the figures.
