      "bodyText": "As British crowing about last year's return to growth increasingly irks the struggling administration of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, it is worth remembering that London and Paris have more in common than they care to admit. While London looks like a vibrant city of skyscraper developments and trendy pop-up nightclubs in contrast to the Napoleonic boulevards of Paris that appear more dishevelled by the month, nevertheless the fight to survive in the global economy is a shared experience for the two historic rivals. Neither really knows how to tax companies and individuals that have become elusively mobile. Both are struggling to generate decently paid jobs in a world where there is a massive oversupply of labour. And crucially, once a job is created, taxed or untaxed, governments face the task of persuading a reluctant employer to invest to boost productivity. Without such a rise, workers will struggle to raise their wages faster than the level of inflation and improve their living standards. On the face of it France has the bigger problem. When prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said a few days before Christmas that his government would not copy British economic policies for fear of creating poverty and inequality, he was being a little disingenuous. \"I see a lot more poverty, more inequalities, and if I were to look for a model to reform France I would want to save the French model, reforming it, and certainly not copy what others do \u2013 especially not if we're not talking about the best,\" he told French private TV network TF1. Ayrault criticised Britain's zero-hour contracts for helping create \"mass poverty far worse than in France\". Yet he sidestepped figures that show the similarities outweigh the differences. Britain has a youth unemployment rate of 21%. In France it has reached 25%. Both countries disguise the level of youth unemployment with an array of training schemes, some more useful than others, and a university system that packs in great numbers of students on courses of sometimes dubious value. France's economy may have almost recovered to its previous 2007 output record while Britain's economy remains 2.5% smaller, but the direction of travel will see the two economies reach parity in a year. UK exports, the favoured growth vehicle in Downing Street, have proved lacklustre and risen only marginally despite a 25% drop in the value of sterling since 2007. France has also struggled to export. In manufacturing survey figures last week a drop in exports dragged the country's industry index further into contraction territory. A fall in business investment was a key factor in last week's dire news for France, and Bank of England lending figures last week told the same story for the UK. While mortgage approvals in November were at their highest level since January 2008, net lending to businesses took its biggest fall since comparable figures began in May 2011. \"Overall the picture from the data today remains consistent with a UK recovery that has been fairly household-led,\" said David Tinsley, UK economist at French bank BNP Paribas. \"We would look for that to change in 2014, but a risk remains that corporates will remain reluctant to borrow and invest.\" It is a point made recently by Howard Davies, the man conducting the government's airport review and a former chief financial regulator. Writing in the Financial Times, he described France and Britain as being like two bald men fighting over a comb. Economists tend to believe the UK's dire business investment story is temporary. The Treasury's own forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted a significant rise in business investment next year \u2013 on the basis that it normally follows a rise in consumer spending. Likewise, Paul Krugman, the Princeton economist and cheerleader for Keynesian policies, has argued that governments can create the right conditions for business investment by pump-priming demand for goods and services. He argues that once businesses see a solid rise in output backed by consistent government policies, investment will follow, bringing decent jobs for young people. But the question must be why any global business would opt for France or Britain to manufacture increasingly homogenised goods to be sold across the world, when Turkey will supply land, factories and a cheap skilled workforce tax-free. The only gain for the Turkish exchequer from business activity in its many enterprise zones is the tax applied to workers' incomes. That is why Ford closed its Southampton factory last summer, after 40 years making Transit vans at the site, in favour of extending its base in Turkey. Maybe this trend would not matter if the 80% of businesses that are entirely domestic \u2013 and so in many ways divorced from the pressures of international competition \u2013 invested in new plant and machinery, developed new techniques and processes and trained staff on a large scale. The problem is they don't. Most research and investment is carried out by big companies. Even the European commission, which dispensed grants for research and development worth \u20ac2.9bn (\u00a32.4bn) to British firms between 2007 and 2011 (and \u20ac2.4bn to French companies) directed most of the money to big corporates. Much of the UK's subsidy was soaked up by GlaxoSmithKline and a small number of major pharmaceutical outfits. The manufacturers' body, the EEF, highlighted in a recent report that foreign-owned companies, which tend to be large, are responsible for 45% of UK manufacturing business investment. The figures are smaller in France, but to its detriment: car manufacturing in the UK, largely foreign-owned, is a success story \u2013 in sharp contrast to France, where indigenous carmakers Renault and especially Peugeot Citro\u00ebn are sacking staff and closing plants. Yet carmaking is an isolated example in Britain, where manufacturing is still 9% off its 2007 peak production and a fraction of the size it was in the 1980s. Britain is further forward in playing the global \"race to the bottom\" by offering low corporate tax rates, enterprise zones and a labour force where internships are rife and international graduates available on tap. France, though, is following, and is not far behind. It may be resisting cuts to established workers' terms and conditions, but it is content to make life miserable for younger entrants and immigrants, who are far more likely to be unemployed or on low wages than immigrants to the UK. Hollande is also shifting his stance to please big business. Not by cutting headline tax rates so much as allowing a raft of reliefs and subsidies for employing new staff, even when they are on short-term, flexible contracts. For the political right wing there is no alternative but to join the race to the bottom. Skilled workers can bid up their wages while those with few skills operate in a twilight zone. But where are the rising aggregate wages going to come from? They have declined since the crash and the trend is still heading south. Without investment, France and Britain are going to continue struggling.",

      "bodyText": "Two businesses owned by Tony Blair have amassed a cash pile of more than \u00a313m after a key part of his empire enjoyed a jump in profits. New accounts filed with Companies House reveal that one venture in the former prime minister's complex network of financial legal entities saw profits jump almost 50% to just below \u00a32m. Since stepping down from politics in 2007, Blair has received millions of pounds from a mix of business interests that include advising governments, consultancy work for US investment bank JP Morgan and the lucrative international speaking circuit. He has insisted he does not want to be \"super-rich\", and has said his income pays for philanthropic projects, including development work in Africa and an inter-faith charity. But after rapidly becoming one of the highest paid public speakers in the world and flying around by private jet he has faced some criticism for his lifestyle. Blair's properties include a multimillion-pound London home and a country retreat once owned by the late Sir John Gielgud, bought for \u00a35.75m . Windrush Ventures, the ultimate owner of which is Blair, made profits of \u00a31,995,000 in the year to the end of March 2013, up \u00a3649,000 from a year earlier. The company, which provides \"management services\", holds \u00a38.8m in cash. The company now employs 35 people and has a wage bill of \u00a33m, equal to \u00a385,000 per employee. Smaller company Firerush Ventures, with less detailed accounts also filed with Companies House and are published on the Office of Tony Blair website, has \u00a34.6m in cash. Blair's office pointed out that the reports do not show the former Labour PM's own earnings. It said in a statement: \"These are the financial statements of the two companies through which the operating costs of the Tony Blair group's global activities are paid. They do not represent his earnings or the earnings or the profit of his businesses and are not referable to them. They do not represent either the accounts of his charities or his donations to them.\" The statement also said the businesses pay full corporation tax , adding: \"The money made by Mr Blair from the Windrush and Firerush businesses is not published in these accounts; it is though, subject to full personal income tax. and that the former prime minister \"Mr Blair continues to be a UK taxpayer and pays full personal tax on all his earnings worldwide.\" One of Blair's most high-profile ventures has been advising the Kazakh government under a contract with Tony Blair Associates. His involvement with a regime denounced by Amnesty International over its \"disgraceful\" record on human rights has drawn criticism. But Blair has said he is working with the government to push through a programme of political and economic reform. The jump in profits at Blair's Windrush is in contrast to the financial fortunes of George Osborne's family business revealed in the latest filings to Companies House. The upmarket fabrics and wallpaper company Osborne &amp; Little, which is chaired by the Conservative chancellor's father, Sir Peter Osborne, suffered widening losses of nearly \u00a3750,000 before tax, blaming a \"poor worldwide economic climate\".",

    "webTitle": "Sir Derek Hornby obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Respected on the international business scene for more than 30 years, Sir Derek Hornby, who has died aged 83, was an executive rather than an entrepreneur, a \"big-company man\" able to navigate the often treacherous waters of multinational corporations with a ready smile and a warm handshake. He moved with equal ease within organisations such as the British Overseas Trade Board, the British Institute of Management and the European Council of Management. A safe pair of hands, a builder of bridges, an oiler of the wheels, he believed big business could and should provide benefits for society as a whole. Though he did not particularly seek widespread recognition, he was thrust more into the public limelight when he agreed to become chairman of London and Continental Railways (LCR) in 1994. The company was set up to bid for the franchise to operate the Eurostar passenger rail service through the Channel tunnel and to build the 67-mile high-speed link between London and the tunnel entrance. Hornby recognised that publicity would be a crucial element during the campaign to win the bid, and ordered a high-profile public relations campaign to be mounted to establish LCR as the natural party to take on the difficult engineering and financial challenge of building the line through the suburbs of London and the commuter dormitories of Essex and Kent. He would happily agree to front photo opportunities and interviews dreamed up by his advisers, trusting their judgment. In the event, LCR won the bid, but it could be argued that this was more to do with its financial offering than publicity. Unfortunately, however, Eurostar revenues failed to meet forecasts, and the service that had been expected to produce the cash to fund the building of the high-speed line was losing money fast. Airlines had responded to the threat to their profitable London-Paris services by cutting prices, and a fire in the tunnel in 1996 further dented passenger confidence. Instead of the 15 million expected passengers, numbers were nearer 3 million. Plans to float LCR on the London Stock Exchange in 1997 had to be abandoned. With the construction timetable now pressing, in 1998 Hornby approached the government for help. Direct government funding of the link was prohibited, and a solution was found by taking the Eurostar stake into public ownership. A year later, being totally dependent on government guarantees for its debt, LCR was nationalised. The rail link and the renovation of St Pancras station were completed successfully. By that time, however, Hornby and his team had resigned. Thereafter he became less involved with business, though his directorship of the advertising agency Cogent Elliott continued until 2011. Born in Bournemouth, Derek was the eldest of five children. His father was killed on second world war service with the Royal Artillery in 1942. Thanks to a government scheme of the time, under which promising students from humble beginnings were sent to private schools, Derek went to Canford school, Dorset. He undertook his national service in Aden, went to work for Mobil Oil, and at the age of 23 married his first wife, Margaret (nee Withers); she was a secretary and he was an office boy. They had a son, Nicholas, and a daughter, Gillian. This marriage did not last, however. Hornby was working his way up the corporate ladder: a senior position at Mars was followed by a stint at Texas Instruments and, in 1973, he was made director of international operations of Xerox Corporation, a move that took him to the US. By then he had left his wife and children to move abroad with a new partner. The children had remained with their mother and it was in the wake of the breakup that Hornby began taking the 11-year-old Nicholas to football. This seeded in the boy a self-confessed addiction to Arsenal and the book that made him famous, Fever Pitch. Nick was not the only literary figure in the family: his sister Gill published her debut novel in 2013, and is married to the author Robert Harris. In 1971 Hornby married Sonia (nee Beesley), with whom he had a further son, Jonathan, and daughter, Victoria. Sonia and his children survive him. He was knighted in 1990, and liked to see himself as the head of a tribe with a total of 14 grandchildren to entertain at the family home in Idlicote, Warwickshire. \u2022 Derek Peter Hornby, businessman, born 10 January 1930; died 16 December 2013",

      "body": "<p>Respected on the international business scene for more than 30 years, Sir Derek Hornby, who has died aged 83, was an executive rather than an entrepreneur, a \"big-company man\" able to navigate the often treacherous waters of multinational corporations with a ready smile and a warm handshake. He moved with equal ease within organisations such as the British Overseas Trade Board, the British Institute of Management and the European Council of Management. A safe pair of hands, a builder of bridges, an oiler of the wheels, he believed big business could and should provide benefits for society as a whole.</p> <p>Though he did not particularly seek widespread recognition, he was thrust more into the public limelight when he agreed to become chairman of <a href=\"http://www.lcrhq.co.uk/\" title=\"London and Continental Railways website\">London and Continental Railways (LCR)</a> in 1994. The company was set up to bid for the franchise to operate the Eurostar passenger rail service through the Channel tunnel and to build the 67-mile high-speed link between London and the tunnel entrance.</p> <p>Hornby recognised that publicity would be a crucial element during the campaign to win the bid, and ordered a high-profile public relations campaign to be mounted to establish LCR as the natural party to take on the difficult engineering and financial challenge of building the line through the suburbs of London and the commuter dormitories of Essex and Kent.</p> <p>He would happily agree to front photo opportunities and interviews dreamed up by his advisers, trusting their judgment. In the event, LCR won the bid, but it could be argued that this was more to do with its financial offering than publicity. Unfortunately, however, Eurostar revenues failed to meet forecasts, and the service that had been expected to produce the cash to fund the building of the high-speed line was losing money fast.</p> <p>Airlines had responded to the threat to their profitable London-Paris services by cutting prices, and a fire in the tunnel in 1996 further dented passenger confidence. Instead of the 15 million expected passengers, numbers were nearer 3 million.</p> <p>Plans to float LCR on the London Stock Exchange in 1997 had to be abandoned. With the construction timetable now pressing, in 1998 Hornby approached the government for help. Direct government funding of the link was prohibited, and a solution was found by taking the Eurostar stake into public ownership. A year later, being totally dependent on government guarantees for its debt, LCR was nationalised.</p> <p>The rail link and the renovation of St Pancras station were completed successfully. By that time, however, Hornby and his team had resigned. Thereafter he became less involved with business, though his directorship of the advertising agency <a href=\"http://www.cogent.co.uk/\" title=\"Cogent website\">Cogent Elliott</a> continued until 2011.</p> <p>Born in Bournemouth, Derek was the eldest of five children. His father was killed on second world war service with the Royal Artillery in 1942. Thanks to a government scheme of the time, under which promising students from humble beginnings were sent to private schools, Derek went to Canford school, Dorset.</p> <p>He undertook his national service in Aden, went to work for Mobil Oil, and at the age of 23 married his first wife, Margaret (nee Withers); she was a secretary and he was an office boy. They had a son, Nicholas, and a daughter, Gillian.</p> <p>This marriage did not last, however. Hornby was working his way up the corporate ladder: a senior position at Mars was followed by a stint at Texas Instruments and, in 1973, he was made director of international operations of Xerox Corporation, a move that took him to the US.</p> <p>By then he had left his wife and children to move abroad with a new partner. The children had remained with their mother and it was in the wake of the breakup that Hornby began taking the 11-year-old Nicholas to football. This seeded in the boy a self-confessed addiction to Arsenal and the book that made him famous, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/interactive/2013/may/18/nick-hornby-fever-pitch-annotations\" title=\"Guardian: Nick Hornby, Fever Pitch - with annotations\">Fever Pitch</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/23/fiction.shopping\" title=\"Guardian: Nick Hornby interviewed by Simon Hattenstone\">Nick</a> was not the only literary figure in the family: his sister Gill published her debut novel in 2013, and is married to the author Robert Harris.</p> <p>In 1971 Hornby married Sonia (nee Beesley), with whom he had a further son, Jonathan, and daughter, Victoria. Sonia and his children survive him. He was knighted in 1990, and liked to see himself as the head of a tribe with a total of 14 grandchildren to entertain at the family home in Idlicote, Warwickshire.</p> <p>\u2022 Derek Peter Hornby, businessman, born 10 January 1930; died 16 December 2013</p>",

      "body": "<p>Somehow New Year\u2019s Day has come and gone, and the resolutions that we make year after year are already haunting us. <em>Exercise. Save money. Don\u2019t spend so much. Don\u2019t eat so much. Pay off that debt.</em></p> <p>Finding the right diet or the right exercise routine, as hard as it can be, is nothing compared to holding on to those hard earned dollars that always seems to be running away from us. Financial planning can be scary, overwhelming and complicated. Sure, there are financial planners that can help us with our finances, but for a wide swath of the population they often charge more than we can afford to spare in the first place.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly why in 2009, Alexa von Tobel decided to drop out of Harvard and launch <a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/about/\">LearnVest</a>, a company devoted to financial planning and education. Her goal: to get people as comfortable visiting their money as they are getting on a treadmill. Financial planning \u201cshould be as accessible as gym membership\u201d, she says.</p> <p>What's unsaid is that she also wants to make it as accessible as the reading on your Kindle. von Tobel has written a new book, <a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/2013/11/financially-fearless-alexa-von-tobels-new-book-hits-stores/\">Financially Fearless</a>, that aims to make people confront their money in a chatty, accessible way, and is equal parts memoir, pep talk, instruction manual and workbook.</p> <p>We caught up with von Tobel \u2013 just as we were making our very own frugal new year\u2019s resolutions \u2013 to chat about her book, the importance of having a financial plan and myths about saving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d93bb4a3-bcc1-4676-9758-ca5f69118e44\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/3/1388771603668/81b9c38b-bc28-4a98-9165-87fa39197add-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"von tobel\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexa von Tobel, founder of LearnVest. Photograph: /LearnVest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You often say that you believe that financial literacy is a fundamental human right. Can you explain why?</strong></p> <p><strong>Alexa von Tobel:</strong> Absolutely. That is one of my favorite things to say and I believe it wholeheartedly. One of the things is, [for instance, that] healthcare is a right; we give you healthcare to make sure you can be protected. One of the things is that money, actually, is fundamental to your life. It's the way to protect your family. And one of the things I believe is that personal finance should be taught in high schools and colleges across the country. And it is not.</p> <p>I was pretty alarmed by the fact that I had an amazing education \u2013 I went to Harvard Business School \u2013 and I literally never learned in a single class or had a single moment of education about personal finance. Yet you make between six to 10 money decisions every day. So I feel passionately about this, since money is the way you can protect your family; it's the way you can retire, when are old and your bones are brittle; it is the way the way to be able to enrich your family, to educate it. I just wish there was an easier way to get financial advice.</p> <p>I know we go to great lengths to make healthcare available to everyone \u2013 and I won't get into that, obviously, there's a lot of going on with that \u2013 but I believe that getting access to advice about your money is also fundamental because if your money is not in great shape, it has an enormous impact. It is one of the largest reasons for divorce. I want to change that, and I'm really passionate about trying to help empower Americans to have better financial lives.</p> <p><strong>What is the bigger mission of the company? How does that influence your interaction with the customers?</strong></p> <p>The bigger mission for the company is that we believe that financial planning should not be a luxury product; it should be as accessible as gym membership. And what we do with customers is when you come to LearnVest, we connect you to an expert, who is your own dedicated expert, and we build you a detailed financial plan and then we hold you accountable.</p> <p>So that's our mission, that's what we do every single day. And when it comes to our customers, we care about treating them like gold. We care about helping them achieve their goals. We care about making sure that they make progress on their money.</p> <p><strong>If we were to start educating people in high school or college about money, what should we be teaching them? What are the three things everyone should know?</strong></p> <p>One, it's critical for you to contribute to retirement, because we're responsible for planning our retirement and there is nothing more valuable than starting early. Compounding interest is not magic, it's just math.</p> <p>Two, better understand how to protect your family. We don't sell insurance, so we tell people that it's critical. Having insurance \u2013 of all types \u2013 is one of the most important ways to protect your family against any danger. And making sure that you have the right levels of insurance and the right insurance at all times.</p> <p>Three, credit card debt is designed to grow and it's designed to grow rapidly. An average college senior graduates with $4,000 of credit card debt. The average household in America has about $9,000. And that ends up paralyzing you, because it grows so quickly that you then don't take care of other financial things that you need to do. It is one of the reasons why people tend to be pretty ashamed, so helping people understand how to pay that debt as quickly as possible can help people make a lot of progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-311f3528-e90f-4eb4-992f-43c715d6fdbf\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/23/1387815540260/8cd5f813-65a7-49b7-bf05-fec118b92e35-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"LearnVest Alexa von Tobel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LearnVest helps its user to set and follow through with a financial plan. Photograph: LearnVest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In your book you share a lot of your personal experiences and anecdotes from your life. You also demand that from your readers: to think about the way they handle money, their past and current experience and to think about the future. Do you think that by asking people to look within themselves just like you had you can get them to perceive money differently? What was your goal?</strong></p> <p>My goal is this: after talking to thousands and thousands of people in customers, I've never met anyone that feels really really great about money. And as a result, one of things that I am trying to do is help people with the shame. There are a lot of reasons we don't talk about money. One is it's extremely complicated and confusing, [which] is why I wrote the book.</p> <p>Another reason people don't get started is most tend to be pretty ashamed. They feel really overwhelmed, they feel guilty, and there is a lot of emotion around money. One of the reasons why I try to open up, why I try to sort of lead the charge saying, \u2018Listen, I have made a mistake. You have made a mistake. It's OK. Let's put that behind us, look forward and do this together.' And, you know, we really are in the same boat: at the end of the day no one ever feels like they have enough money.</p> <p>Everyone always feel silly because they've made a mistake. You know, just today I talked to few people who confessed that they have a tremendous amount of credit card debt. And one of the things I am here to say is we can always make progress, there is always progress to made. It's just the matter of you deciding to take the first step.</p> <p><strong>I feel like if I have picked up your book or signed on to LearnVest, I have already made that first step. I made a decision to take a look at my money a little closer. How do you get people to make that call? What's the first hurdle that they have to overcome to get here?</strong></p> <p>One thing that we see and are really grateful for is that when people come to LearnVest, they are [already] starting to make progress. That's pretty exciting, and we're happy to see it. Also, to take that first step, they think they do need help.</p> <p>How do you get them to take that step? That's one of the reasons why I am going on a tour. I am going across the entire country \u2013 it's called Financially Fearless America \u2013 for the entire month of January. We are bringing experts. We are going everywhere from homes to bookstores to colleges to companies to hospitals to churches to bring the message 'We can do this together.\u2019 It's right in time for New Year's and resolutions, and we know about half the country will have resolutions about money. So that's one of the reasons for my book tour, to go out and raise awareness, to help people take that first step.</p> <p><strong>What's your target audience? Older, younger \u2026 ?</strong></p> <p>Anyone. Men, women, older, younger, educated and not. I cover every major financial topic that you can think of. When you are in the book, it's really well designed and if something doesn't apply to you, skip this chapter. If you don't have mortgage yet, skip it. If you don't have kids yet, skip that chapter. And it's really made because I wanted one manual that anyone can read to get their financial advice.</p> <p><strong>What is the demographic of your users?</strong></p> <p>Men and women. It's mostly couples, between 25 to 60. They are people who are well educated. And it's really helpful to men and women to enroll in the service as a couple; more than half our users are couples. We're doing the financial plan for the whole household.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important for couples to plan out their finance together?</strong></p> <p>Money is one of the largest causes of stress across the country; 76% of the country feels out of control. It's one of the largest reasons why people fight. It is actually proven that having a financial plan with your significant other tremendously improves your relationship. The reason for that is actually very simple: when you have a financial plan, it actually takes into account all the things that you don't have time to do, and gets you on the same page about so many things: traveling, where your kids are going school, what house you live in, how you pay your bills. It's really powerful and we believe that financial planning can really improve your life in so many ways. One is actually by getting you on the same page with your significant other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f44317b1-7476-475f-ae49-ce16628f15a1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/3/1388771690772/588400d2-0882-48c0-8704-33cf0f321625-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"learnvest book\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Von Tobel's book,&nbsp;Financially Fearless. Photograph: /LearnVest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>As you have mentioned, looking at your money can be a stressful and confusing experience. What is the most common hurdle that people face once they start looking at their finance?</strong></p> <p>They don't know where to start. One of the biggest things is we find ourselves saying, \u2018If I only had <em>x</em>' \u2013&#xa0;<em>x</em> can be a $100 \u2013 \u2018of extra money a month. With $1,000 of extra money a month, what do I do with it? What would be your priority for that money?' So we get a lot of people saying, 'If I am in a position where I can only save $300 a month, where does it go? Because I have to save for retirement, pay down the credit card debt, and juggle student debt. And I'm also trying to save for a baby. And I'm also trying to contribute towards my 401k.' And so that's the biggest question. People get paralyzed by all those things that the money is supposed to be doing. So that's what we teach them, and that's exactly the purpose of a financial plan, because it will help you figure that out.</p> <p><strong>One of the many misconceptions that I think a lot of the people have about sitting down and going over their financial plan is that they have to save everything, that they have to give up their lattes and little perks like manicures and books. Yet, you mention in your book that that isn't really the case.</strong></p> <p>One of the things that we are passionate about in terms of our brand is making sure that we help people recognize that at LearnVest, our brand isn't about deprivation, it's about helping you achieve what you want to achieve, whatever that might be. So I think what's really important, particularly about that, we do smart things like help you have a lifestyle budget so that you can spend a little on yourself.</p> <p>If you come to LearnVest and you want to buy a million dollar home, we would run all the math for you and say, 'You know what? You can't buy a million dollar home this year, but you can buy it next year. Or if you want to buy a home this year, you can't buy a million dollar home but you can buy $850,000 home.' So what we do is help you make decisions about your money and let you know what's possible, what's within your means, and what's going to keep you protected.</p> <p><strong>When you say you help your customers build financial plan and hold them accountable, how do you do that?</strong></p> <p>Let's just pretend it's you. Let's say you bought a plan today. We would have you fill out a form online about what's going on in your financial life. We'd have an expert pore over it and build you a custom plan \u2013 and when I say custom plan, I mean we build you a monthly calendar of exactly where your dollars should go, down to the penny. We tell you what accounts you need, we tell you what insurance you need, we tell you what to close and then we literally check in with you. Not only weekly, but monthly, to make sure you are doing it.</p> <p>So we tell you what to do and then we hold you accountable, to make sure that you're actually executing it. We answer all of your questions along the way, and we're really on demand for you.</p> <p><strong>One of the other misconceptions that we often hear about is that people believe that they have to have some money saved up before getting started on financial planning. Is there some amount that people should have before coming up with a plan?</strong></p> <p>When you have less money, it's more critical for you to have a financial plan because mathematically every extra dollar you have is more critical. So, one of the things that I am trying to change and raise awareness around is that not having a financial plan <em>is</em> a plan. It's a really bad plan. And we need to get everyone a financial plan to improve their lives significantly.</p> <p><strong>A good financial plan should be revisited and updated as you reach certain milestones, such as a promotion or a raise, or paying off certain debt. Do you find that people are coming back to their financial plans and adjusting them as necessary?</strong></p> <p>One of the amazing things that LearnVest is doing and that's so disruptive is that your financial plan updates every day based on what you are doing. This isn't a print-it-out, one-time-only financial plan. It's dynamic financial planning so if you get a bonus, we factor that in and it changes. If you lose your job, we replan and rebuild you a new concept of what you should be doing. That's one of the most amazing things that LearnVest is really doing, it isn't a one point snapshot. It really is designed to keep up with you.</p> <p><strong>What do you look for when hiring for LearnVest?</strong></p> <p>I hired two people today. The last question is always [ask candidates is]: why can you get behind our mission? I ask things like, \u2018Tell me about what's stressful in your financial life. What worries you? What worried your family growing up?' It's an honest way to connect with someone. What ends up happening is everyone has a story, and I really do talk to everyone about this; and they'd say \u2018I didn't save enough\u2019 or \u2018I'm in debt\u2019 or \u2018I'm doing this.\u2019 It gets them committed to what we're doing and they recognize all the ways we can help.</p> <p>I hired someone today, for example, who has been a LearnVest customer. I have actually hired two people in the last week who have been LearnVest customers, because they were so excited about what we are doing. I'll also say is that this is a long journey, so we also make sure that everyone we hire shares our mission, our belief, and our passion for what we're trying to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f0c49a5-f82d-4eaf-af0b-e06a34898eba\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/2/1385976971514/Energy-bills-011.jpg\" alt=\"Energy bills\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bills can be made less daunting by having a financial plan. Photograph: Outers Magazine/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Did you ever think that this is what you would be doing?</strong></p> <p>I actually did have a pretty good idea. You know, I was really passionate about this topic, it really spoke to me. I feel like life is short and I have limited days here on this earth and I want to be in the position to help empower other people's lives and really make an impact and so that's part of the reason why I am so passionate about that we are doing. I always knew I wanted to do something that would help improve people's lives. I come from a family of doctors and so I think, I always wanted to do something that was bigger and greater than me.</p> <p><strong>When you were first starting LearnVest, what was the hardest thing about starting a company?</strong></p> <p>When I was first starting LearnVest, the hardest thing about starting a company was ... You know, I dropped out of the Harvard Business School in the middle of recession. That was a pretty scary thing to do, because I was in a comfortable, safe place, if you will, with two years of school ahead of me at the heart of the recession. Then once I made them jump, everything got easier. I was so focused. I was so committed.&#xa0;</p>",

Having insurance \u2013 of all types \u2013 is one of the most important ways to protect your family against any danger. And making sure that you have the right levels of insurance and the right insurance at all times. Three, credit card debt is designed to grow and it's designed to grow rapidly. An average college senior graduates with $4,000 of credit card debt. The average household in America has about $9,000. And that ends up paralyzing you, because it grows so quickly that you then don't take care of other financial things that you need to do. It is one of the reasons why people tend to be pretty ashamed, so helping people understand how to pay that debt as quickly as possible can help people make a lot of progress. In your book you share a lot of your personal experiences and anecdotes from your life. You also demand that from your readers: to think about the way they handle money, their past and current experience and to think about the future. Do you think that by asking people to look within themselves just like you had you can get them to perceive money differently? What was your goal? My goal is this: after talking to thousands and thousands of people in customers, I've never met anyone that feels really really great about money. And as a result, one of things that I am trying to do is help people with the shame. There are a lot of reasons we don't talk about money. One is it's extremely complicated and confusing, [which] is why I wrote the book. Another reason people don't get started is most tend to be pretty ashamed. They feel really overwhelmed, they feel guilty, and there is a lot of emotion around money. One of the reasons why I try to open up, why I try to sort of lead the charge saying, \u2018Listen, I have made a mistake. You have made a mistake. It's OK. Let's put that behind us, look forward and do this together.' And, you know, we really are in the same boat: at the end of the day no one ever feels like they have enough money. Everyone always feel silly because they've made a mistake. You know, just today I talked to few people who confessed that they have a tremendous amount of credit card debt. And one of the things I am here to say is we can always make progress, there is always progress to made. It's just the matter of you deciding to take the first step. I feel like if I have picked up your book or signed on to LearnVest, I have already made that first step. I made a decision to take a look at my money a little closer. How do you get people to make that call? What's the first hurdle that they have to overcome to get here? One thing that we see and are really grateful for is that when people come to LearnVest, they are [already] starting to make progress. That's pretty exciting, and we're happy to see it. Also, to take that first step, they think they do need help. How do you get them to take that step? That's one of the reasons why I am going on a tour. I am going across the entire country \u2013 it's called Financially Fearless America \u2013 for the entire month of January. We are bringing experts. We are going everywhere from homes to bookstores to colleges to companies to hospitals to churches to bring the message 'We can do this together.\u2019 It's right in time for New Year's and resolutions, and we know about half the country will have resolutions about money. So that's one of the reasons for my book tour, to go out and raise awareness, to help people take that first step. What's your target audience? Older, younger \u2026 ? Anyone. Men, women, older, younger, educated and not. I cover every major financial topic that you can think of. When you are in the book, it's really well designed and if something doesn't apply to you, skip this chapter. If you don't have mortgage yet, skip it. If you don't have kids yet, skip that chapter. And it's really made because I wanted one manual that anyone can read to get their financial advice. What is the demographic of your users? Men and women. It's mostly couples, between 25 to 60. They are people who are well educated. And it's really helpful to men and women to enroll in the service as a couple; more than half our users are couples. We're doing the financial plan for the whole household. Why is it important for couples to plan out their finance together? Money is one of the largest causes of stress across the country; 76% of the country feels out of control. It's one of the largest reasons why people fight. It is actually proven that having a financial plan with your significant other tremendously improves your relationship. The reason for that is actually very simple: when you have a financial plan, it actually takes into account all the things that you don't have time to do, and gets you on the same page about so many things: traveling, where your kids are going school, what house you live in, how you pay your bills. It's really powerful and we believe that financial planning can really improve your life in so many ways. One is actually by getting you on the same page with your significant other. As you have mentioned, looking at your money can be a stressful and confusing experience. What is the most common hurdle that people face once they start looking at their finance? They don't know where to start. One of the biggest things is we find ourselves saying, \u2018If I only had x' \u2013 x can be a $100 \u2013 \u2018of extra money a month. With $1,000 of extra money a month, what do I do with it? What would be your priority for that money?' So we get a lot of people saying, 'If I am in a position where I can only save $300 a month, where does it go? Because I have to save for retirement, pay down the credit card debt, and juggle student debt. And I'm also trying to save for a baby. And I'm also trying to contribute towards my 401k.' And so that's the biggest question. People get paralyzed by all those things that the money is supposed to be doing. So that's what we teach them, and that's exactly the purpose of a financial plan, because it will help you figure that out. One of the many misconceptions that I think a lot of the people have about sitting down and going over their financial plan is that they have to save everything, that they have to give up their lattes and little perks like manicures and books. Yet, you mention in your book that that isn't really the case. One of the things that we are passionate about in terms of our brand is making sure that we help people recognize that at LearnVest, our brand isn't about deprivation, it's about helping you achieve what you want to achieve, whatever that might be. So I think what's really important, particularly about that, we do smart things like help you have a lifestyle budget so that you can spend a little on yourself. If you come to LearnVest and you want to buy a million dollar home, we would run all the math for you and say, 'You know what? You can't buy a million dollar home this year, but you can buy it next year. Or if you want to buy a home this year, you can't buy a million dollar home but you can buy $850,000 home.' So what we do is help you make decisions about your money and let you know what's possible, what's within your means, and what's going to keep you protected. When you say you help your customers build financial plan and hold them accountable, how do you do that? Let's just pretend it's you. Let's say you bought a plan today. We would have you fill out a form online about what's going on in your financial life. We'd have an expert pore over it and build you a custom plan \u2013 and when I say custom plan, I mean we build you a monthly calendar of exactly where your dollars should go, down to the penny. We tell you what accounts you need, we tell you what insurance you need, we tell you what to close and then we literally check in with you. Not only weekly, but monthly, to make sure you are doing it. So we tell you what to do and then we hold you accountable, to make sure that you're actually executing it. We answer all of your questions along the way, and we're really on demand for you. One of the other misconceptions that we often hear about is that people believe that they have to have some money saved up before getting started on financial planning. Is there some amount that people should have before coming up with a plan? When you have less money, it's more critical for you to have a financial plan because mathematically every extra dollar you have is more critical. So, one of the things that I am trying to change and raise awareness around is that not having a financial plan is a plan. It's a really bad plan. And we need to get everyone a financial plan to improve their lives significantly. A good financial plan should be revisited and updated as you reach certain milestones, such as a promotion or a raise, or paying off certain debt. Do you find that people are coming back to their financial plans and adjusting them as necessary? One of the amazing things that LearnVest is doing and that's so disruptive is that your financial plan updates every day based on what you are doing. This isn't a print-it-out, one-time-only financial plan. It's dynamic financial planning so if you get a bonus, we factor that in and it changes. If you lose your job, we replan and rebuild you a new concept of what you should be doing. That's one of the most amazing things that LearnVest is really doing, it isn't a one point snapshot. It really is designed to keep up with you. What do you look for when hiring for LearnVest? I hired two people today. The last question is always [ask candidates is]: why can you get behind our mission? I ask things like, \u2018Tell me about what's stressful in your financial life. What worries you? What worried your family growing up?' It's an honest way to connect with someone. What ends up happening is everyone has a story, and I really do talk to everyone about this; and they'd say \u2018I didn't save enough\u2019 or \u2018I'm in debt\u2019 or \u2018I'm doing this.\u2019 It gets them committed to what we're doing and they recognize all the ways we can help. I hired someone today, for example, who has been a LearnVest customer. I have actually hired two people in the last week who have been LearnVest customers, because they were so excited about what we are doing. I'll also say is that this is a long journey, so we also make sure that everyone we hire shares our mission, our belief, and our passion for what we're trying to do. Did you ever think that this is what you would be doing? I actually did have a pretty good idea. You know, I was really passionate about this topic, it really spoke to me. I feel like life is short and I have limited days here on this earth and I want to be in the position to help empower other people's lives and really make an impact and so that's part of the reason why I am so passionate about that we are doing. I always knew I wanted to do something that would help improve people's lives. I come from a family of doctors and so I think, I always wanted to do something that was bigger and greater than me. When you were first starting LearnVest, what was the hardest thing about starting a company? When I was first starting LearnVest, the hardest thing about starting a company was ... You know, I dropped out of the Harvard Business School in the middle of recession. That was a pretty scary thing to do, because I was in a comfortable, safe place, if you will, with two years of school ahead of me at the heart of the recession. Then once I made them jump, everything got easier. I was so focused. I was so committed.",

      "bodyText": "When Gina Topliff Frost, 56, and her husband, John Topliff, 57, were made redundant in 2011 from their jobs as drama teachers, they decided to start their own theatre. They took on an empty unit in a central Manchester shopping centre, and Three Minute Theatre began putting on sketches for shoppers. They have just moved into a large former clothes shop in the same centre and had it converted into a fully functioning theatre with a capacity of 70. \"We knew that at our age we would find it hard to get a job, so we took a risk and went for it,\" said Topliff Frost. \"I've discovered I'm a natural entrepreneur and I had no idea. I wouldn't do anything else now.\" The couple are part of a boom in the number of people aged 50-plus who are starting businesses for the first time. These \"olderpreneurs\" are looking at poor pensions and realising that they are healthier than their parents' generation at the same age. So they are rejecting the received wisdom that enterprise is a young person's game and striking out on their own. As the state pension age is gradually raised to 68, more older people are likely to emulate them in 2014. \"I have experienced ageism, but I just laugh in the face of it,\" said Topliff Frost. \"I just say I'm qualified to do it and I've got a lot more experience than you, so what's your problem?\" But it's not been plain sailing. \"It's very tricky running your own business. You've got to be creative \u2013 you have to come up with solutions to problems.\" Colleges and voluntary bodies now run training courses for over-50s who want to start their own firms. Topliff Frost got help from the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (Prime), an extension of the Prince's Trust, which has long aided young people to start up in the business world. The number of \"olderpreneurs\" is growing. In 2009 there were just over 1.5 million people aged 50-plus registered as self-employed. Now that figure stands at 1,766,000 \u2013 an increase of more than a quarter of a million. Around one in five people aged over 50 is self-employed, a higher proportion than for any other age group. Indeed, most entrepreneurs are in their 50s, not their 20s. They are more successful, too: more than 70% of businesses started by people in their 50s survive for at least five years, whereas only 28% of those started by younger people last that long. Older people's enterprises tend to be smaller and in the service sector, catering or producing craft items. A quarter of \"olderpreneurs\" started their businesses after redundancy and 12% started after retirement. Hilary Farnworth, who used to teach a Forward at Fifty course at London Metropolitan University, training women in entrepreneurial skills, said: \"The women have many reasons for choosing self-employment. Some regard it as the only viable option in a culture where they feel employers are ageist; some have a long-held passion to work for themselves and realise time is running out.\" A year ago, former software designer Rod Boyes, 51, started Pinegrove Leather, which produces cases for musical instruments and tablet computers. He expects to turn over \u00a320,000 this year and hopes to exceed \u00a3300,000 a year in five years' time. \"I imagine it's harder for most people of my age striking out on their own because we have responsibilities such as mortgages or children at university,\" he said. \"And when you're older you haven't got so much energy. But there are benefits: you have a lot of experience, so if you were a manager you have already had to do financial reports and you've already seen marketing plans in action. Overall, I'm really excited about starting a business at this time of my life.\" As professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Glasgow, Ron Botham carried out research into the motives for older people to set up businesses. \"Having worked for someone else, many older people think they can run a business better than their boss, and nowadays people in their 50s and 60s are either bankrupt or not badly off, so many have the start-up capital to do it,\" he says. In London, Valerie Hufton, 55, is handing around cream-topped fairy cakes to her Prime course mates as she presents her business plan for the cafe-cum-art-gallery-cum-gift shop she is about to open in Derbyshire. The business is to be named Because I Like It, with the slogan \"wine, arts, teas and tarts\". It was when a cancer scare last year coincided with her husband, Nigel, 45, being made redundant that they decided on a change of direction. They travelled through south-east Asia and the idea of a gallery hit them when they saw fine art works for sale in Cambodia. \"I wanted to do something with this art to get more money into the communities we had been visiting,\" explains Valerie, who previously managed a purchasing system in the travel industry. But setting up the business has not been smooth. \"There are highs and lows. Last week was a low because it looked like the whole thing had fallen through. Now I'm on a high because we've managed to rescue it, and we are nervous because we're putting about \u00a358,000 of our savings into it.\" They plan to start operating on 31 January. \"I'm really excited about starting a business at my age. What we have found strange is that the businesses we have visited to take over are being sold by people just a few years older than me. They're retiring while I'm just starting.\"",

    "webTitle": "George Soros warns that Chinese slowdown is biggest worry in 2014", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Soros is worried about China, and we should take note. The hedge fund boss, who built his fortune betting on the world's money markets, is concerned that 20 years of rapid growth is about to run out of steam. Soros, who famously bet against the strength of the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism and won during 1992's Black Wednesday debacle, will be a prominent figure at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month, when policymakers and business people debate how to foster global growth. In the Square Mile, a brief glance at the stock market shows the impact of a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing output last month \u2013 and the fear that this will become protracted. The FTSE 100 is down 30 points since the new year break. It includes mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which have strong links to the Chinese economy. Signs that the world's second-largest economy is slowing have caused the price of many commodities to fall, and helped break a 12-year bull run for the gold price. (China consumes around half of the world's iron ore and coal, and buys more than a third of its base metals.) Beijing's move to cut back on corn imports made the grain the worst-performing commodity last year, as it fell almost 40%. Predictions that China's economy lost momentum in the final quarter of last year were underscored by figures showing that the manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in December as export orders weakened. Official figures can say whatever the Chinese authorities want them to say, but there is widespread agreement that the economy is suffering a longer-term slowdown. Mark Williams at thinktank Capital Economics said the news that China has a $3 trillion (\u00a31.8tn) local government debt mountain would fuel the fear: \"Activity among large firms has turned down again and is likely to cool further as policymakers rein in local government debt. We therefore expect China's economy to slow again this year.\" Soros bluntly states that three years of worrying over the eurozone should give way to worrying about China. It's not that he believes a solution has been found to the debt mountains in parts of Europe; it's just that he thinks the euro problem has reached a plateau while China could be on the skids. He said: \"The major uncertainty is not the euro but China. The growth model responsible for its rise has run out of steam.\" Until recently China has thrived by restricting households' spending, effectively forcing them to save. The savings are channelled into industrial production. Foreign exchange built up in the boom years has mostly been invested in international expansion \u2013 in Africa and in parts of Asia neglected by a previously aloof Japan. The financial crisis showed the weakness in the idea of becoming the workshop for the world when that world couldn't afford to go on buying. To keep the wheels turning, local authorities and other government agencies were allowed to borrow.

The hedge fund boss, who built his fortune betting on the world's money markets, is concerned that 20 years of rapid growth is about to run out of&#xa0;steam.</p> <p>Soros, who famously bet against the strength of the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism and won during 1992's Black Wednesday debacle, will be a prominent figure at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month, when policymakers and business people debate how to foster global growth.</p> <p>In the Square Mile, a brief glance at the stock market shows the impact of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/china-growth-manufacturing-decline-property\" title=\"\">slowdown in Chinese manufacturing output</a> last month \u2013 and the fear that this will become protracted. The FTSE 100 is down 30 points since the new year break. It includes mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which have strong links to the Chinese economy. Signs that the world's second-largest economy is slowing have caused the price of many commodities to fall, and helped break a 12-year bull run for the gold price. (China consumes around half of the world's iron ore and coal, and buys more than a third of its base metals.) Beijing's move to cut back on corn imports made the grain the worst-performing commodity last year, as it fell almost 40%.</p> <p>Predictions that China's economy lost momentum in the final quarter of last year were underscored by figures showing that the manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in December as export orders weakened. Official figures can say whatever the Chinese authorities want them to say, but there is widespread agreement that the economy is suffering a longer-term slowdown.</p> <p>Mark Williams at thinktank Capital Economics said the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/30/chinese-local-authorities-owe-18tn\" title=\"\">China has a $3 trillion (\u00a31.8tn) local government debt mountain</a> would fuel the fear: \"Activity among large firms has turned down again and is likely to cool further as policymakers rein in local government debt. We therefore expect China's economy to slow again this year.\"</p> <p>Soros bluntly states that three years of worrying over the eurozone should give way to worrying about China. It's not that he believes a solution has been found to the debt mountains in parts of Europe; it's just that he thinks the euro problem has reached a plateau while China could be on the skids.</p> <p>He said: \"The major uncertainty is not the euro but China. The growth model responsible for its rise has run out of steam.\"</p> <p>Until recently China has thrived by restricting households' spending, effectively forcing them to save. The savings are channelled into industrial production.</p> <p>Foreign exchange built up in the boom years has mostly been invested in international expansion \u2013 in Africa and in parts of Asia neglected by a previously aloof Japan.</p> <p>The financial crisis showed the weakness in the idea of becoming the workshop for the world when that world couldn't afford to go on buying. To keep the wheels turning, local authorities and other government agencies were allowed to borrow.</p> <p>Last year the Chinese leadership said it recognised that plan was flawed, and public sector debt needed to be cut. But when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/china-growth-manufacturing-decline-property\" title=\"\">the economy slowed dramatically</a> after borrowing was restricted, the policy was quickly reversed.

Anyway, the resilient King \u2013 who is so loyal to Sainsbury's that his improbably tanned skin matches the grocer's corporate colours \u2013 likes a bit of audience participation. When confronted with the cries about his tenure coming to an end, he has unfailingly yelled back: \"Oh no it isn't.\" One day, he'll be wrong about that. RSA set to bring oversights into focus The stock market adage says profit warnings come in threes, so 2014 should be a stellar year for troubled insurance firm RSA \u2013 which neatly got its trio of disasters out of the way during an efficient six-week period last year. You'll recall that the fiasco partly revolved around the uncovering of accounting irregularities in the firm's Irish arm, knocking 2013's profit expectations and leading to the departure of Simon Lee, the group chief executive. Since then there have been rumours that the company is going to have to put itself up for sale, raise capital, cut costs, or opt for a combination of all three. But on Thursday we may get more clues about what caused the calamity when the company releases the key findings of a review by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers into the \"oversight and controls of the Irish business\". The task of hosting the presentation will fall to the chairman, Martin Scicluna, so it will be especially interesting to hear what he has to say about the role played by accountants Deloitte, RSA's former auditor, which failed to spot anything untoward. This is an area Scicluna, who has been RSA chairman for a year, knows well. Up until 2007, he headed the auditing business of, er, Deloitte.",

      "bodyText": "Last year was the year the food ran out. Not at the supermarkets, bursting with produce, but for thousands of people hit by rising prices, low wages and welfare cuts. Despite Britain's reviving economy, many found themselves unable to afford basic food in 2013. In response, the number of food banks in Britain has soared and the implications of that growth were debated in parliament. Last month, Britain's first social supermarket opened its doors, selling food and drink in damaged packaging at a 70% discount to people on the brink of food poverty. It is not only those on the breadline: at a time of falling real wages, almost everyone has become a bargain-hunter. The big supermarkets are being squeezed by discounters: Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all ceded market share to cut-price rivals Aldi and Lidl. The trend has not been lost on Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the billionaire founder of easyJet and serial entrepreneur. In August Haji-Ioannou unveiled loose plans for easyFoodstore, a budget grocer selling essentials such as pasta, tinned tomatoes, soap and toilet roll at sub-supermarket prices. He hopes to offer a limited range of 100 items for around 50p each. The idea is that customers would benefit from ultra-cheap prices and Haji-Ioannou would make a profit, especially if he could buy up cheap retail space for more branches. The original plan for an early 2014 opening has now been delayed, but Haji-Ioannou is still set on the idea \u2013 although there are, he says, some major questions to be answered. \"First, is it possible to add a limited range of frozen foods and still be cost effective? Second, we want to automate the checkout process with self-service scanning using handheld devices. The technology is out there but is it cost effective? Third, we want to see how feasible cashless payment is, bearing in mind the target audience.\" To eliminate the costs and security risks of handling cash, easyGroup is looking at ways to let customers load up a payment card with cash. The group has recently started using photo ID at Food from the Heart, Haji-Ioannou's project in his native Cyprus to give basic food to the needy, which was the other trigger for his idea. As far as suppliers are concerned, there is no big-name retail partner. \"There are many wholesalers that stock these items and the idea is to shop around for the best deal each and every time. It is all meant to keep costs down in order to offer most of the roughly 100 items for about 50p each.\" Patrick O'Brien at Verdict Retail is struck by the fact that Haji-Ioannou wants his store to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl. \"It is not immediately apparent that there is a great gap there,\" he says. \"They are extremely competitive for your everyday items that I imagine easyFoodstore would be stocking.\" O'Brien thinks the concept could work on a national scale if easyGroup developed a chain in the convenience-store sector, which is \"not an oversaturated market in terms of the discounters\". Haji-Ioannou, however, has previously described easyFoodstore as a \"non-convenience store\", opening perhaps only six hours a day to keep costs down. O'Brien adds: \"They are a very innovative organisation that does try different business models and is prepared to make mistakes.\" That could be a polite reference to the mixed fortunes of Haji-Ioannou's recent ventures. While his orange-liveried planes transformed the airline industry, attempts to bring the no-frills model to cruise liners and cinemas flopped, while easy4men toiletries sank without trace. But no one disputes the prize of getting a slice of the UK's food and grocery market, which was worth \u00a3170bn in 2012 and is growing. Aldi and Lidl have seized \u00a31bn worth of sales from the big four supermarkets over the past year and some see room for more competition. \"In a highly concentrated British food retail sector, which is arguably an oligopoly, there is always room for new entrants,\" says Clive Black of Shore Capital. \"Indeed, such is the boredom with big stores \u2013 [the] degree of anti-corporatism and the drive for value, difference and more individuality on behalf of shoppers \u2013 we deem it an ideal time to enter the British food market. Whether 'Mr Easy's' plot can rock the industry remains to be seen, but there is an opportunity to take on not just the big four but also the Co-op and other discounters.\" For now, there is no target date for opening the first branch. Haji-Ioannou says there is more work to do and that easyFoodstore has to compete for time with easyGroup's other projects. The next move is to open a \"mock-up\" store on the ground floor of easyGroup's building in Croydon, to test systems and consumer reaction \"in a controlled environment\" in the next few months. \"Think of it as a laboratory,\" Haji-Ioannou says. \"I still have more questions than answers about this industry.\"",

      "bodyText": "Limits govern everything \u2013 from the speed of light to our ability to absorb oxygen or withstand heat. The art of operating within the tolerance thresholds of the material world is what keeps roofs above our heads and bridges standing. Yet, we blithely disregard this at the level of the whole economy. When Daedalus, the Athenian master craftsman, flew, it was a triumph of intelligently crafted ambition. The fall of Icarus, his son, when he failed to respect the heat tolerances of the wax and feathers keeping him aloft, is a lasting monument to fatal disregard of material boundaries. Britain's economy is in the grip of an Icarus complex. It touches everything from, appropriately, the debate on aviation expansion, to our increasing dependence on fossil fuels and the historically unprecedented scale and speed of tropical deforestation driven by over-consumption. At the micro level, engineers learn to work within the thresholds of the material world, but at the macro level economists do not. Their models allow them to externalise the cost of failure. However \u2013 as with pyramid-selling schemes \u2013 this only delays and makes larger a later, system-wide collapse. The macroeconomics practised by government remains clueless with regard to any theory of optimal scale. Yet, as finance and the sub-prime mortgage market discovered, bigger often doesn't equal better. A straightforward proposal logically follows: the economy should operate within the biosphere's thresholds, its ability to absorb our waste and replenish its productivity. Good estimates are available for what this means in terms of most of our planetary boundaries, from the climate to forests, farming and fisheries. Once this simple principle is adopted, it introduces an urgent and immediate decision tree. If something like a new airport runway, or expansion of fossil fuel extraction, is going to take you closer to, or further beyond, one of the biosphere's tolerance thresholds \u2013 such as potentially runaway climate change \u2013 you branch off and do something else. In a world of rational policy debate that would mean no enlargement of Heathrow, or having to identify compensatory carbon savings elsewhere. The latter is not as easy as it sounds as some official projections for expansion lead to the aviation industry using up the UK's entire fair global share of safe carbon emissions before too long. All the tax breaks and subsidies given for gas fracking or offshore oil would be redirected to beneficial alternatives. If you reject the notion of living within our environmental means and the immediate choices it implies, what is the logical counter-proposal: that we consume and produce waste beyond the biosphere's ability to absorb and replenish? Such an approach relies upon magical thinking. Yet this is the proposition on which every major economy operates, because none seeks scientifically to identify and operate within the best estimate of its limits. A peculiar self-absorption allows us to think we can exist separately to the laws that govern the physical world. In its survey of economists for 2014, the Financial Times asked a question about the likely \"sustainability\" of the UK economy in the year ahead. In it the meaning of sustainability was completely drained of any sense of the environment. It referred only to whether \"recovery\" \u2013 growth in consumption \u2013 would continue. Strangely, the economics of austerity is held up with constant reference to more ideological, self-imposed limits: limits to what we can expect from health, education and other public services, of the pay we can expect or the age at which we can receive a pension. Expectations and ambitions for what the public sphere can achieve are constantly restrained. The only area which knows no bounds in policy terms is the assumption of unlimited consumption growth from finite ecosystems. There's an unspoken judgment that to acknowledge limits is defeatist, rather than a mature recognition of basic operating conditions. But, as any architect or civil engineer will tell you, the art, precisely, is in discovering what can be achieved creatively given the tolerance of your materials. Working with physical, material limits doesn't block creativity, it sets it free \u2013 think of the sound unleashed from wood and gut crafted into a violin, the sight lines of a Frank Gehry building or a statue in stone by Michelangelo, Moore or Hepworth. Push, yes, but don't break. Concern for the environment doesn't mean a hair-shirt rejection of the material world. On the contrary, it calls for a healthy relationship with it, based on more respect, knowledge, creativity and care. Yes, it rejects wasteful, debt-fuelled, passive consumerism and calls instead, for a more engaged, hands-on \"new materialism\". A green economy does this by insisting on quality over quantity, repairability over disposability and by treating people as intelligent agents, capable of learning about, using, maintaining and remaking material objects that endure. In an economy that recognises and revels in the real world, and more active, creative production, there is far more potential for novelty and pleasure. The popular retelling of the Icarus myth tends to overlook the achievement of Daedalus, who not only flew but landed safely because he understood limits. Take flight, says the moral of the story \u2013 soar \u2013 but find a way to do so that doesn't melt your wax.
