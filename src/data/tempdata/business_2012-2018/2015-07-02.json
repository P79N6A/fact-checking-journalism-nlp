In Athens, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, could be forgiven for shouting: \u201cI told you so.\u201d Debt relief has been a central plank of his demands from the day he was elected in January. Tsipras might also curse the IMF for making its declaration only now, three days before the referendum. The IMF has been muttering about debt relief for Greece for months but behind-the-scenes briefings don\u2019t carry the same clout as an official publication. Why didn\u2019t the IMF shout earlier? First, the organisation was probably embarrassed by its role in the flawed and inadequate first bailout of 2010. Debt relief should have happened at that time and the IMF should have insisted upon it. Instead, Greece\u2019s private sector creditors \u2013 largely European banks \u2013 were bailed out and risky Greek debt was shifted onto eurozone taxpayers and institutions. Second, Tsipras got his strategy hopelessly wrong. Back in the spring, and even in the last few weeks, there was clearly an opportunity for Greece to drive a wedge between the IMF and hardliners in Germany. If Tsipras could have persuaded the IMF to put debt relief onto the negotiating agenda, other pieces of the jigsaw might have fallen into place. He might have found it easier to sell to his own electorate a version of the austerity programme that, belatedly, he accepted in a letter to the European commission this week. If the IMF was trying to push him in that direction, Tsipras refused to jump. Instead, the referendum will happen this Sunday \u2013 it will be a bizarre vote on proposals the creditors say are no longer on the table. It is conceivable that the attempt by the IMF to bang heads together could influence the outcome. More likely, both sides will see support for their own positions. The no supporters will say Tsipras was right all along to complain about the unsustainability of the debt burden and the need for relief. The yes camp will argue that Syriza\u2019s political naivety prevented a deal being done before damaging capital controls arrived. BP\u2019s costly deepwater dividend In the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010, BP made what it thought was a conservative provision for the fines, damages and litigation costs that would follow \u2013 $38bn (\u00a324bn). Now, after Thursday\u2019s $18.7bn settlement of all federal and state claims, comes a figure that is close to a final tally: $53.8bn. Throw in a few legal loose ends and call it $55bn. The lower guess was made fanciful long before Thursday, of course. The $18.7bn settlement was roughly in line with revised expectations. BP\u2019s share price rose 4% on relief and also because the bill will be paid in instalments until 2033. Roughly speaking, BP will pay $1.1bn a year for 18 years. Put like that, it sounds affordable, shareholders concluded. In a sense, they\u2019re right. The current dividend (restored the year after Deepwater Horizon at a much lower level) costs $6bn a year. The biggest threat to the divi is now the lower oil price, and its effect on profits, not the legal fights. For true optimists, legal clarity means would-be bidders might be attracted to BP. Don\u2019t bank on it. The list of credible suitors is short. BP still comes with heavy political risks in Russia. And, at the current oil price, most oil majors are too busy cutting their own costs to take on the challenge of fixing a rival\u2019s. The American dream Sir Charles Dunstone\u2019s last US adventure was a splendid success. Carphone Warehouse collected a $1bn windfall in 2011 when local partner Best Buy bought it out of a joint venture. Since then, Carphone has been merged with Dixons, which has a poorer pedigree in the US. Back in the 1990s, Dixons lost a packet by owning the Silo chain and failing to adapt to American tastes. Thankfully, the new US expedition is more Carphone than Dixons. It\u2019s a 50/50 joint venture with Sprint, the third-largest mobile operator in the US. As with the Best Buy arrangement, the idea is that Carphone brings fresh ideas, technology and retailing nous to the job of flogging mobile phone contracts. About 20 shops will open as a trial; if they go well, up to 500 will follow. Dixons Carphone will also act as a sort of super-consultant to Sprint\u2019s established estate of 1,100 stores. It is odd that these US companies feel they have to phone Dunstone when they\u2019re in a retailing rut. But Dixons Carphone is right to take up a low-risk offer. Success is not guaranteed but an investment of $32m for a 50% interest in the new venture means the price of entry is reasonable.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The German discount supermarket Lidl and its sister chain Kaufland have benefited from almost $900m (\u00a3576m) in public development money over the past decade, the Guardian can reveal. The companies, owned by the large retail company Schwarz Group and controlled by one of Germany\u2019s wealthiest families, received loan funding from a little-known wing of the World Bank and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). These public institutions, funded by taxpayers and owned by governments, have explicit mandates to increase local development in the countries where they spend their money. The World Bank also has an additional, specific mandate to reduce global poverty. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing with regard to the receipt of the money. The banks said their funding for Lidl and Kaufland would help the companies expand across central and eastern Europe, creating jobs, opening new markets for local producers and bringing \u201cgood quality, affordable food\u201d to poor consumers. However, these claims have been attacked by trade unions and development groups. Luiz Vieira, coordinator of the Bretton Woods Project, a British NGO that monitors the World Bank, said: \u201cThis idea that an injection of capital to multinationals will lead necessarily to good, sustainable growth has been repeatedly proven false over the last 20 years.\u201d Jan Czarzasty, professor at the Warsaw School of Economics, said the amount of public money that the Schwarz Group had received was shocking. \u201cEverywhere where they open new stores, there are stories that come to the surface regarding working conditions; employee satisfaction is generally low \u2026 it seems part of the business model of Lidl, as a company.\u201d In Poland, Lidl has been the focus of repeated protests from its workers. \u201cWe are overworked, we do the work that should be done by many more people,\u201d said Lukasz, an employee on the night shift at a Lidl warehouse who did not want to give his surname. He said his wrists have swollen and he has bruises on his skin from packing and unpacking heavy loads of fruits and vegetables \u2013 but that it is risky to speak out. \u201cPeople are afraid to lose their jobs,\u201d he said. Reports from the state labour inspectorate in Poland, seen by the Guardian, document repeated violations of the national employment laws at Lidl, including breaches of provisions on working time that require employers to give workers at least 11 hours off each day and 35 hours of uninterrupted rest each week. Alfred Bujara, chairman of the retail section at Poland\u2019s Solidarity trade union, said workers who try to organise at Lidl face harassment and bullying by managers. \u201cStress and intimidation is very high,\u201d he added. The Schwarz Group, which started in the 1930s as a grocery wholesaler in Germany, is now one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing retailers, and its head, Dieter Schwarz, is one of the world\u2019s richest men, worth an estimated $21bn . In the UK, there are now more than 600 Lidl stores where sales are soaring, although the chain has not been immune to controversy. Last year, the company hit the headlines with reports that Polish staff in Scotland were forbidden from speaking their native language, including with Polish customers. According to its records, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the lesser-known but increasingly powerful branch of the World Bank that invests in private companies, gave its first $100m loan to the Schwarz Group in 2004 \u2013 the same year that the German trade union Ver.di released its \u201cblack book\u201d on Lidl in Europe, documenting alleged labour rights violations. This funding, the IFC said at the time, was to help the group expand in \u201cselected urban areas\u201d in unspecified \u201ctarget countries in central and eastern Europe\u201d. The Guardian has confirmed that some of this money went to finance the expansion of Lidl in Poland. In 2009, this was followed by $75m for Kaufland to expand in Bulgaria and Romania, and in 2011 by $66m for Lidl in Romania. In 2013, more than $105m was given for Lidl\u2019s plans to scale up in Bulgaria and Croatia and to open its first stores in Serbia. In total, the IFC provided about $350m in long-term loans towards the Schwarz Group\u2019s march across Europe. The EBRD, which often co-finances projects with commercial banks, has raised more than $700m for Lidl and Kaufland over the last decade, contributing nearly $500m itself. The IFC defended its investments in the Schwarz Group, saying that its eastward expansion has \u201ccreated new channels for local farmers to supply their products. Consumers gained access to a more affordable and diverse selection of high-quality food products.\u201d Gilles Mettetal, head of agribusiness at the EBRD, said: \u201cFor the people, it changed their lives.\u201d He added that the retailer provided a \u201cmodel that at the time didn\u2019t exist, which was targeting the lower social category, a poorer category, offering products to people who otherwise could not afford them. \u201cThis is the credit I give them. They have been, yes, a quite commercially aggressive group, but they have people accessing products that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to access otherwise.\u201d Vieira said the banks should have to prove that their funding has done more good than bad. \u201cThey\u2019re public institutions operating with public money, so I think transparency should be the point of departure \u2026 without transparency they cannot guarantee there will not be negative impacts from their funding.\u201d The IFC and EBRD said they regularly monitor their investments, but that data on how many jobs were created and how the company\u2019s expansion has affected local producers was commercially sensitive information and therefore confidential. Lidl in Poland said the company has 14,000 employees in more than 500 shops across the country, with fair working conditions. Wages at Lidl are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than those at other retailers in Poland and employees get \u201cnumerous social benefits\u201d including free private healthcare, it added. Lidl in Poland \u201chas always been open to dialogue with employees as well as with trade unions\u201d, the company said. Lidl did not respond to questions about its receipt of public development money. In Poland at least, Lidl is not necessarily the cheapest supermarket. A survey in 2014 priced a standard basket of goods at Lidl at 47.8zl (\u00a38.50), while at Tesco, which also operates in the country, the same shopping cost 40.1zl (\u00a37.10). Czarzasty said it is Lidl\u2019s strategy to constantly look for new destinations for its stores, \u201csystematically penetrating smaller and smaller locations, smaller towns, in many cases villages\u201d, which can squeeze out local traditional retailers and fundamentally change rural economies. \u201cIt\u2019s another variation of the Walmart effect \u2026 there may be some new jobs created, but how many? And how many jobs are lost? We don\u2019t know that.\u201d In Romania, Lidl has opened more than 185 stores since 2011 \u2013 an average of almost one a week for four years. In Bucharest nearly all of the chain\u2019s outlets are within walking distance of an older, local marketplace. Ion Garalin, a small-scale trader who has sold local produce at the Piata Gorjului market in western Bucharest for more than two decades, says this has made a difficult situation even worse. \u201cReally, the most negative impact is that they\u2019ve chosen to open stores very close to local markets like this one,\u201d said the 67-year old, standing in front of a stall piled high with fresh vegetables, waiting patiently for customers. Today, this once bustling market is now eerily silent. \u201cWe\u2019re being eaten alive \u2026 We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d Down the street, dozens of shoppers are zipping down the no-frills aisles of a Lidl, picking up products \u2013 from jars of pickles to specialties such as herring fillets in tomato sauce \u2013 stacked on metal shelves and wooden pallets on the floor. \u201cI like the avocados,\u201d says Camelia, an elegantly dressed woman standing beneath the store\u2019s familiar red, blue, and yellow logo. However, she said it is hard to believe the company would have received any public development money. \u201cOf course I know what the World Bank is, and perhaps they could have found a better use for their money considering all the problems we have in Romania.\u201d \u2022 Claire Provost and Matt Kennard are Bertha Fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism.

In total, the IFC provided about $350m in long-term loans towards the Schwarz Group\u2019s march across Europe.</p> <p>The EBRD, which often co-finances projects with commercial banks, has raised more than $700m for Lidl and Kaufland over the last decade, contributing nearly $500m itself. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/18/lidl-german-discounters-uk-supermarkets-ronny-gottschlich\">Every Lidl helps?

Consumers gained access to a more affordable and diverse selection of high-quality food products.\u201d</p> <p>Gilles Mettetal, head of agribusiness at the EBRD, said: \u201cFor the people, it changed their lives.\u201d He added that the retailer provided a \u201cmodel that at the time didn\u2019t exist, which was targeting the lower social category, a poorer category, offering products to people who otherwise could not afford them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the credit I give them. They have been, yes, a quite commercially aggressive group, but they have people accessing products that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to access otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Vieira said the banks should have to prove that their funding has done more good than bad. \u201cThey\u2019re public institutions operating with public money, so I think transparency should be the point of departure \u2026 without transparency they cannot guarantee there will not be negative impacts from their funding.\u201d<br>  The IFC and EBRD said they regularly monitor their investments, but that data on how many jobs were created and how the company\u2019s expansion has affected local producers was commercially sensitive information and therefore confidential. <br></p> <p>Lidl in Poland said the company has 14,000 employees in more than 500 shops across the country, with fair working conditions. Wages at Lidl are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than those at other retailers in Poland and employees get \u201cnumerous social benefits\u201d including free private healthcare, it added. Lidl in Poland \u201chas always been open to dialogue with employees as well as with trade unions\u201d, the company said.</p> <p>Lidl did not respond to questions about its receipt of public development money. <br></p> <p>In Poland at least, Lidl is not necessarily the cheapest supermarket. A <a href=\"http://www.mmkrakow.pl/artykul/ktory-supermarket-w-polsce-jest-najtanszy-ranking,2701980,art,t,id,tm.html\">survey in 2014</a> priced a standard basket of goods at Lidl at 47.8zl (\u00a38.50), while at Tesco, which also operates in the country, the same shopping cost 40.1zl (\u00a37.10).</p> <p>Czarzasty said it is Lidl\u2019s strategy to constantly look for new destinations for its stores, \u201csystematically penetrating smaller and smaller locations, smaller towns, in many cases villages\u201d, which can squeeze out local traditional retailers and fundamentally change rural economies. \u201cIt\u2019s another variation of the Walmart effect \u2026 there may be some new jobs created, but how many? And how many jobs are lost? We don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p> <p>In Romania, Lidl has opened more than 185 stores since 2011 \u2013 an average of almost one a week for four years. In Bucharest nearly all of the chain\u2019s outlets are within walking distance of an older, local marketplace. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a403224e149605dfb809328c6d537fbca61071a7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434380480388/2c530ed0-c70e-4572-8100-6f143f79489c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Scallions for sale in a Bucharest market.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scallions for sale in a Bucharest market.

The 79% taxpayer-owned bank is fighting a long-running case in a Connecticut court relating to the way it packaged up mortgage bonds and sold them to government lenders overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHFA brought the case in 2011 and it is yet to go to trial, although RBS has made repeated references to the legal proceedings in its disclosures to shareholders in its annual report. Analysts have been estimating a potential cost for the Connecticut action but until now a potential figure had not been put on the size of the suit, uncovered by Bloomberg which looked at recent filings related to the case.

RBS has so far set aside \u00a35.4bn to cover the cost of past errors and misdeeds, according to its results of the first three months of 2015. Ross McEwan, the boss of RBS, warned at the time: \u201cThere are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon.\u201d However, it is regarded as unlikely that the final sum will be $13bn. The bank is also facing a fine relating to the sale of bonds. The payouts are looming at a time when the chancellor, George Osborne, has said he is ready to start selling off the taxpayer stake in the bank, even though the shares are still worth \u00a313bn less than was paid for them. While the first sale of RBS shares is yet to take place, the government\u2019s stake in Lloyds Banking Group fell further on Thursday \u2013 to less than 16% \u2013 after another chunk of shares was sold off. The stake stood at 43% after LBG\u2019s bailout in 2008.",

    "webTitle": "Dixons Carphone moves into tricky US  market with Sprint joint venture", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dixons Carphone is moving into America with plans for a chain of up to 500 stores after signing a joint venture deal with the US telecoms group Sprint. The venture is the first deal for the British group since it was created last year through the merger of Dixons, which runs the Currys and PCWorld chains in the UK, and mobile phone firm Carphone Warehouse. Both have crossed the Atlantic before with varying degrees of success. Three decades ago, an attempt by Dixons to crack the notoriously difficult American market ended in failure. After buying the Silo and Tipton electricals chains in 1987 and expanding rapidly it racked up millions of dollars in losses and sold up in 1993. Carphone Warehouse had a successful US mobile phone shop venture with American retailer Best Buy but was bought out for \u00a3838m in 2012. The companies also closed 11 Best Buy stores which had been set up in the UK because of poor sales. Andrew Harrison, deputy group chief executive of Dixons Carphone and head of the group\u2019s CWS division which will lead the Sprint venture, said: \u201cWe have always maintained an ambition to go back to the US. This, for us, is the start of a number of relationships all around the world.\u201d He said Dixons Carphone was in talks with potential partners about similar ventures in Europe and elsewhere. CWS already provides retail expertise to companies including Samsung across various countries and the furniture and electricals chain Harvey Norman in Ireland. Its Pinpoint customer services technology is also used in Apple\u2019s UK stores and it provides phone insurance services for Aviva and others. \u201cWe have learned that working with an established brand in a market which is already successful is far easier than creating a greenfield brand in a market,\u201d said Harrison. Harrison added that many of the same team which had worked on the successful Best Buy venture would be involved in the Sprint project, helping avoid the difficulties experienced by many British retailers in the US. \u201cWe went to the US market with a well thought-through plan and in a determined way, looking at how others had failed,\u201d Harrison said. The venture with Sprint, which has more than 1,000 outlets across the US, will involve CWS supplying mobile phone retail expertise to support 20 new shops. If those initial stores, which will open by the end of September, are a success then Dixons Carphone will invest $32m (\u00a320m) for a 50% share in the joint venture. That cash will fund the opening of a total of 500 new Sprint stores on US high streets. Harrison said a decision on the second phase was likely to be taken in the first quarter of 2016. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep Dixons away from the US ... The disastrous experience with the Silo electrical chain in the US in the 1990s is, of course, deeply etched on the Dixons corporate psyche, but more recently Carphone had a great deal of success with its venture with once-mighty Best Buy in the US and there is nothing to stop them now working with their former rival Sprint.\u201d For many other British retailers the American dream has turned sour. Tesco spent 20 years pondering a move into the US before setting up Fresh &amp; Easy in California in 2007. However, it misjudged its American customers and ignored much of its own research, and the failed chain Fresh &amp; Easy filed for bankruptcy in 2013. The US foray cost the supermarket group nearly \u00a32bn. Marks &amp; Spencer bought US clothing chain Brooks Brothers and grocer Kings in 1988 and offloaded both in 2001 at a huge loss. Sainsbury\u2019s fared better with its Shaw\u2019s acquisition, which performed well despite some problems with US unions, but sold the chain to Albertsons for $2.5bn in 2004 to focus on its struggling UK business. WH Smith was hit by the the travel and retail downturn that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, and sold its stores in American hotels and airports.",

Its Pinpoint customer services technology is also used in Apple\u2019s UK stores and it provides phone insurance services for Aviva and others.</p> <p>\u201cWe have learned that working with an established brand in a market which is already successful is far easier than creating a greenfield brand in a market,\u201d said Harrison.</p> <p>Harrison added that many of the same team which had worked on the successful Best Buy venture would be involved in the Sprint project, helping avoid the difficulties experienced by many British retailers in the US. \u201cWe went to the US market with a well thought-through plan and in a determined way, looking at how others had failed,\u201d Harrison said.</p> <p>The venture with Sprint, which has more than 1,000 outlets across the US, will involve CWS supplying mobile phone retail expertise to support 20 new shops. If those initial stores, which will open by the end of September, are a success then Dixons Carphone will invest $32m (\u00a320m) for a 50% share in the joint venture. That cash will fund the opening of a total of 500 new Sprint stores on US high streets. Harrison said a decision on the second phase was likely to be taken in the first quarter of 2016.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/03/pricey-tvs-spur-double-digit-growth-at-dixons-carphone\">Pricey TVs spur double-digit growth at Dixons Carphone</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep Dixons away from the US ... The disastrous experience with the Silo electrical chain in the US in the 1990s is, of course, deeply etched on the Dixons corporate psyche, but more recently Carphone had a great deal of success with its venture with once-mighty Best Buy in the US and there is nothing to stop them now working with their former rival Sprint.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/09/fresh-not-easy-tesco-british-failure-america\">For many other British retailers the American dream has turned sour</a>.

      "bodyText": "The two main directors of the Financial Conduct Authority have collected a combined \u00a3157,000 in bonuses after a year in which the watchdog imposed a record \u00a31.4bn of fines on City firms. Tracey McDermott, who oversaw the fines, received a \u00a365,000 bonus for the 2014/5 financial year, according to the annual report published on Thursday. She has since been promoted to director of supervision from her role running the enforcement and financial crime division. Martin Wheatley, the FCA boss, received a \u00a392,000 bonus. In the previous year he had not been given a bonus because of a botched briefing about life insurance \u2013 when \u00a33bn was wiped off the value of insurers\u2019 shares after the Daily Telegraph was told about the watchdog\u2019s plan for a sweeping review of policies. Last year, the Treasury received \u00a31.4bn of fines from the FCA, mostly from a \u00a31.1bn penalty on five banks for rigging foreign exchange markets. The fines for the financial year to the end of March 2015 were higher than those levied in the previous four years combined. The FCA also admitted it still could not set a publication date for the results of its investigation into the collapse of HBOS in 2008. The report, which it is conducting alongside the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, was previously promised by the end of last year. \u201cWe and the PRA are committed to publishing the report as soon as possible but the legal process of Maxwellisation and consent can be lengthy. Maxwellisation is the process, required by law, whereby anyone subject to potential criticism is given an opportunity to see those references, comment in response and have those comments considered by the person preparing the report. Following this, we will need to obtain consent from various parties to publish in the report any information deemed confidential by law,\u201d the annual report said. The bonuses to the two top FCA executives took Wheatley\u2019s total pay to \u00a3701,000 and McDermott\u2019s to \u00a3475,000. The annual report also showed that she has now received a \u00a345,000 bonus for the previous financial year, which had been withheld after the insurance briefing debacle. Clive Adamson, head of supervision at the time of the botched briefings, did not receive a bonus for either of the years and left in January 2015. However, he was paid until the end of May, receiving a total of \u00a3438,000. The tally of fines issued by the FCA was published the day after the Bank of England pointed to the potential financial instability posed by the regulator\u2019s fines. In its half-yearly assessment of the risks in the financial system, the Bank said the impact from fines was wider than the financial hit to banks, with its agents around the UK finding evidence that small businesses were avoiding borrowing from banks because of their reputation. While the FCA is levying record fines, it found that suspicious trading in shares ahead of takeovers \u2013 a potential sign of the scale of insider trading \u2013 had fallen to a low of 14% from 15% previously.",

      "bodyText": "The US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3% \u2013 the lowest in seven years \u2013 after the economy added 223,000 jobs in June. The drop in the unemployment rate from 5.5% in May to 5.3% June takes it to the level that the US government considers full employment, and heightens expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as soon as September. However, the Labor Department said the biggest reason for the fall in the unemployment rate was because people out of work gave up looking for a job and were thus no longer counted as unemployed. Labor secretary Thomas Perez welcomed \u201canother solid jobs report\u201d. \u201cNot only is the quantity of jobs growing but the quality too,\u201d he said. Perez added that more work needed to be done and that wages needed to rise. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic bullet that will raise wages for everyone,\u201d he said. But he said that the Obama administration\u2019s move to raise the number of people who qualify for overtime payments and efforts to raise the minimum wage would help. \u201cPart of [the issues the jobs market still faces] is the depth of the hole we had to dig out from,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent decades, with the exception of the last few years of the Clinton administration, workers have not shared fairly in recovery and employees have got an all too disproportionate share.\u201d The addition of 223,000 jobs was lower than the 233,000 economists had expected. The department also had to revise down, by 60,000, the number of jobs it previously said were added in April and May. \u201cThe headline payrolls rise was only 223,000, a little less than the published consensus, though we suspect that the real consensus was closer to our house view of 260,000,\u201d Rob Carnell, Chief International Economist at ING, said. \u201cRubbing salt into the wound, there were also 60,000 of downward revisions, and the May result was revised down to 254,000 from 280,000.\u201d The US economy has been adding jobs at an average rate of 217,000 a month so far in 2015, raising expectations that the Fed may make a historic move to increase interest rates in September. The US central bank has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cWe are likely to see the Fed continue to prepare the ground for an initial rate hike later this year. However, the Fed will stress that policy will be very much dependent on economic conditions remaining supportive in coming months. \u201cMoreover, the pill will be sweetened by strong reassurances that a benign inflation outlook means the path of further rate rises will be gently sloping and carefully measured, rather than steep and aggressive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With markets in positive territory, mining group BHP Billiton is the leading riser in the FTSE 100 after a couple of positive broker notes. BHP is currently up 20p at \u00a312.80 after UBS issued a buy note, albeit with a price target lowered from \u00a316.25 to \u00a314.50. The bank said: We are attracted to BHP Billiton as it has a sustainable dividend yield of more than 6% and offers an option on 1) a recovery in oil/gas &amp; copper prices (as well as iron ore and met-coal); 2) medium-term growth in copper/ oil/ potash; 3) potential for a major oil discovery in Trinidad &amp; Tobago (with more visibility next year). BHP has a low cost position, strong balance sheet, and operates mostly in OECD countries. It has now largely completed its restructuring after the spin out of South32, with only a few other smaller assets to be exited (Nickel West, International Petroleum, etc.). BHP management is now focused on lowering unit costs/capital expenditure further and delivering superior cash returns through the cycle. Meanwhile in a note on the sector, Barclays said: BHP Billiton (overweight) would be our preferred long exposure given sector-leading margins, low beta and a decent operating performance expected. We continue to believe in a stronger second half 2015 for commodity demand overall and would see the current weakness in the sector as a buying opportunity. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 14.40 points at 6622.99 as investors await further developments in the Greek crisis and the US non-farm payroll numbers later. AstraZeneca also benefited from a positive broker note, up 43.5p to \u00a341.64 as Berenberg moved from hold to buy: AstraZeneca has made good progress in its oncology pipeline and there are a number of oncology catalysts expected in the next 12 months which will help margins rebound. The oncology franchise will grow from a low of $2.8bn this year to $6.9bn by 2023. AstraZeneca\u2019s growth potential has been undervalued and it will return to double-digit growth beyond 2017. In the mid-cap index, the biggest riser is pharmaceutical group BTG, up 36p at 677p as Peel Hunt moved from hold to buy. Analyst Dr Paul Cuddon said: BTG\u2019s shares have now priced in a disappointing first year of sales for [varicose veins treatment] Varithena and a correction in consensus forecasts that had also been overly optimistic in the second year .of launch. Strong revenue growth is still expected to March 2016 driven by the continued performance of acquisitions, DigiFab and royalties. We now see scope for the shares to outperform this year driven largely by the performance of acquisitions. We also see a rich pipeline of clinical news-flow building in the first half of 2016 that will provide increased confidence in longer term forecasts. There is now 20% upside to our 790p target price, we upgrade to buy. Halfords has dipped 6p to 530.5p as it appointed Jonny Mason, currently at Scandi Standard, as its new finance director. Analyst Nick Bubb said: You may think it odd that the new finance director of Halfords comes from a Scandinavian chicken producer (Scandi Standard)\u2026but, Jonny Mason, for it is he, turns out to be a former finance director of the Sainsbury\u2019s UK supermarket business and today\u2019s announcement trumpets that he is \u201ca cycling and car enthusiast\u201d!",

Construction data signalled a further rebound in the sector\u2019s output growth from the 22-month low recorded in April that many economists took to be a signal of nervousness ahead of an election that could have brought higher property taxes under a Labour-led coalition. The headline seasonally adjusted Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) jumped from 55.9 in May to 58.1 in June. The index compiler, Markit, said the latest reading was well above the long-run survey average (54.6) and pointed to the fastest rise in overall construction activity since February. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said: \u201cHaving spoken to people at the coalface, I gather that there is a bit of an election effect going on here. Various projects were likely to have been held back. So what we may be seeing here is a post-election catch-up.\u201d Last month, the Office for National Statistics said construction was not such a big drag on the wider economy in the first quarter of 2015. The upward revision to previously lacklustre figures resulted in economic growth rising to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year rather than the 0.3% previously estimated. Markit said respondents to the survey said their clients were feeling buoyant about the outlook for the UK economy, pushing overall growth of new work to its second successive month of expansion and its steepest rise since October 2014. \u201cAnecdotal evidence linked greater new business volumes to rising client confidence and improving business conditions across the UK economy as a whole,\u201d it said. An upturn in job creation across the construction sector was also a prominent factor in June. Markit said the latest increase in employment numbers was the fastest since December 2014. \u201cMoreover, strains on subcontractor availability persisted in June, although the latest rise in subcontractor charges was the least marked for nine months,\u201d it said. Stefan Friedhoff, a spokesman for Lloyds Bank\u2019s commercial lending arm, said the industry was struggling to reap the benefits of the recovery as skills shortages and rising input prices squeezed profit margins. \u201cThere is confidence in the market, particularly given the business environment has become more stable over the past two months. Despite this and record order books, however, ongoing price sensitivity continues to put margins under huge pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the causes of this \u2013 a shortage of suppliers and labour, project delays and demanding clients, among other things \u2013 are long-term industry issues likely to ensure slim margins remain for the foreseeable future.\u201d",

But with the political temperature rising, any further comments from either Greece or its creditors have the possibility to move global markets. On top of that come US jobs figures, a day early because of the Independence Day holiday on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Yesterday\u2019s ADP employment report reinforced the picture of a positive labour market with 237,000 jobs added, the best number this year. The latest ISM manufacturing report was also much better than expected. Today\u2019s US employment report is expected to be similarly positive, after a decent May number of 280,000. Expectations are for 230,000 new jobs to be added, with the unemployment rate set to fall to 5.4%. It is the wages data that is expected to get the main attention though with average hourly earnings expected to remain steady at 2.3%. A number higher than that could well give the US dollar a hefty nudge upwards, as well as raising the prospect of a Fed move on rates at its September meeting. So the FTSE 100 is currently down just 1.57 points at 6607.02, slipping back despite June\u2019s UK construction PMI index rising to a four month high.

But Dixons Carphone is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 15.8p at 474.6p after signing a deal with US group Sprint to run stores for the mobile operator in America. Lower down the market BATM Advanced Communications has climbed 12% to 17p as it unveiled a contract to supply a cyber-security service to a government defense agency. The deal is worth $3.7m initially but could rise to $20m over the next five years. Analysts at finnCap said: This contract was part of the pipeline of work expected by the company so we are not raising our forecasts at this stage; however, it helps to firm up results and builds confidence in the group\u2019s commercialisation of an excellent cyber-security offering based on its 10G networking platform and its proprietary software.

      "bodyText": "Serco used to be the biggest company you had never heard of. For three decades it grew in the borderlands between the state and society, the government and us. Its name stands for \u201cservice company\u201d and Serco, which combined great ambition with a desire to be unseen, wanted to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It was as much a formula as a company: a way to implement outsourced public services on behalf of governments, but with the elan of a restless entrepreneur. It didn\u2019t matter what the service was, where it had to happen, or to whom it was delivered. Serco started out operating radars in Yorkshire and traffic lights in London, but it came to work with schoolchildren and doctors, commuters and prisoners, pilots and refugees. It was designed to be limitless, and to grow for ever. At its peak, Serco had a workforce of 125,000, contracts on four continents, and revenues of \u00a35bn. But in 2013, the formula faltered. Everybody heard about Serco, and the roof fell in. The trouble started in the spring. A young civil servant, a fast-streamer in the Ministry of Justice, noticed strange numbers in the documents submitted by Serco and G4S (another large outsourcing company) as the firms prepared to renew two electronic tagging contracts that they held with the British government. Since 2005, the two companies had earned around \u00a3700m from monitoring thousands of criminals, suspects and recently released convicts via tracking devices attached to their ankles \u2013 a practice introduced by the Home Office to reduce prison costs in 1999. But according to the junior civil servant, whose findings were initially dismissed, they were overcharging the state. The paperwork that embodies government outsourcing, the physical contracts themselves, tells you a lot about how vexatious the whole business is. Capturing exactly what the state wants done on its behalf \u2013 the running of a railway system, the rehabilitation of prisoners \u2013 can produce dizzying piles of paper for even mundane tasks. The government chivvies its contractors to do a thousand things correctly. Private companies seek to minimise their risks, and ensure a quiet profit at the end of the day. Everyone covers their arse furiously. The documents that emerge are hundreds of pages long, dense with KPIs (key performance indicators) and SLAs (service level agreements) and kept secret from the customers \u2013 us, the public \u2013 whom they are supposed to benefit. Once they are signed, they are rarely looked at again. For the tagging contracts, it was decided that it was up to the crown, and not G4S or Serco, to decide when individuals should be fitted with a tag. This made sense, but it gave rise to an aberration. The companies came to regard monitoring cases as open or closed on the basis of letters they received from the courts and prisons, rather than anything to do with the physical fitting or taking off of tags. They billed the state until they had a document telling them not to, even if the subjects had died, disappeared or were no longer wearing a tag. G4S\u2019s computers were set to continue billing to 2020; Serco\u2019s to the year 3000. Over the years, letters got lost, notifications were not followed up, and these cases accreted. No one checked the contract. Serco charged the Ministry of Justice \u00a315,500 for five years of monitoring a suspect they never managed to locate in the first place. When the anomalies came to light in 2013, they showed that the companies had invoiced the taxpayer for millions of pounds\u2019 worth of nonexistent work. \u201cYou are charging us for people who are dead,\u201d as one Cabinet Office official involved in the subsequent showdown told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the contract says you can, it is a wrong thing.\u201d Serco and G4S were banned from bidding on new government work for six months, while investigations into their other contracts were carried out. The Serious Fraud Office got involved. The revelations hit Serco particularly hard. The British central government provides a quarter of its global revenues. The idea that the company was ripping off its most important customer \u2013 \u201cthe goose that laid the golden egg\u201d, as Serco executives sometimes called it \u2013 panicked investors. The share price slid. Then, in late August, the Ministry of Justice announced that the police were looking into \u201cpotentially fraudulent behaviour\u201d on a second Serco contract: this time a \u00a3285m deal to transport prisoners to and from court in London and East Anglia. A sense of crisis enveloped the company. Investors, politicians and the press connected what had previously been isolated controversies \u2013 in 2012 Tthe Guardian revealed that Serco had altered statistics and mismanaged an out-of-hours healthcare contract in Cornwall \u2013 into a pattern of failures and dishonesty. For those already suspicious of Britain\u2019s outsourcing complex, Serco came to represent everything that was wrong with it: anonymous, omnipresent, and playing us all for fools. In the space of five months, \u00a3500m was wiped from the company\u2019s stock market value. On 23 October, Chris Hyman, the company\u2019s chief executive \u2013 a charismatic South African who had been at Serco since it was founded \u2013 resigned. \u201cThe best way for the company to move forward,\u201d he said, \u201cis for me to step back.\u201d (Hyman did not respond to requests for comment .) Internally, Serco reeled. The company had always exuded a moral confidence that was unusual in an industry best known for cost-cutting. Hyman was an evangelical Christian. He tithed, donating part of his salary to his local Pentecostal church, and fasted once a week. Employees were rewarded for \u201cliving Serco\u2019s values\u201d and managers were given \u201ccommitments\u201d rather than budgets or financial targets to meet each year. The tagging scandal cast all that in doubt. \u201cSerco\u2019s ethical compass needed to be reoriented,\u201d said Alastair Lyons, the company\u2019s chairman at the time, who was in charge of finding Hyman\u2019s successor. Over the course of the winter, the board came to believe that they had found the man to do it, and on February 28 2014, Serco appointed its new chief executive, Rupert Soames, on a pay package worth more than \u00a32m a year. Soames, who is 56, is regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most capable businessmen. Before taking the job at Serco, he ran a Scottish company called Aggreko that makes diesel generators and supplies temporary power projects around the world. Soames joined Aggreko in 2003, after its previous chief executive was killed in a car crash, and led the firm through an impressive decade of growth, during which its profits, sales and workforce had multiplied many times over. Whether he likes it or not, however, Soames also stands for something else. Choosing him was an opportunity for Serco to revive itself at the well of the British establishment. Soames\u2019s eldest brother is Sir Nicholas Soames, a former Conservative defence minister. His father was Sir Christopher Soames, an ambassador to France and the last governor of Rhodesia. His mother, Mary, learned to swear while commanding an anti-aircraft battery in Hyde Park during the blitz. His grandfather was Winston Churchill. Merely being around Soames \u2013 who is bulky, self-assured, and often speaks in similes that involve things like spaniels, grandmothers, rhododendrons and oysters \u2013 evokes sensations of an earlier, stronger Britain. Sentences come heavy with italics and euphemism, sometimes both. (I once heard Soames characterise the royal family as \u201cthat side of things\u201d). His default mood is one of loud amusement. At Oxford, where Soames was president of the union, he spent most of his time spinning records. He drove down to London twice a week to play the decks at Annabel\u2019s, and brought the beats to Charles and Diana\u2019s engagement party in 1981. He might have been the poshest DJ in the world. He loves control, and he loves to lead. When Lyons met Soames, he perceived \u201ca streak running through him of service and duty\u201d, and he is not the only one. \u201cIt is something almost military,\u201d an old friend, who has known Soames since university, told me. \u201cIt cascades down from his grandfather. He likes to look over his shoulder and see 10,000 people marching.\u201d Soames himself hates this kind of talk. He abhors swanking of any kind, and bristles at casual references to his background. \u201cSomebody asked me: \u2018What\u2019s it like being Churchill\u2019s grandson?\u2019\u201d he said to me once, putting on a nasal voice to indicate that this was an annoying question. \u201cAnd I say, I have got no fucking idea because I have never been anything else.\u201d Still, he possesses an innate relish for the work of the state, what he calls \u201cthe public service bit\u201d. Soames went for the Serco job on the day he heard that Hyman had resigned. And despite working in the private sector all his life, there is a sense that in the unglamorous world of public sector outsourcing \u2013 thankless, complex and human \u2013 Soames has joined the family tradition at last. \u201cRupert,\u201d as his older brother Sir Nicholas, put it, \u201chas the architecture.\u201d Since taking over at Serco, he has begun to replace the company\u2019s corporate speak of \u201cvalue creation\u201d and \u201cmarket opportunities\u201d with a more plain-spoken dialect of people and their problems. \u201cThis is called government. This is called public affairs,\u201d Soames said once, when we were discussing Serco\u2019s high-profile contracts to detain asylum seekers in the UK and Australia. He could have been speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions. For all the assurance that he has brought, however, and the shadow of his forefathers, no one knows whether Soames can save Serco. About a month after he got the job, he went to see Margaret Hodge, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, parliament\u2019s main watchdog over the UK\u2019s \u00a3120bn outsourcing industry. \u201cHe said he was going to turn it all around,\u201d she told me. \u201cAll the gossip to me was that he was going to go bust.\u201d The company has staggered from month to month. Since 2013, Serco has issued three profit warnings, raised \u00a3715m from its shareholders to meet its debts, and announced losses of more than \u00a31bn. Its share price has traced a long and dismal totter, from 682p in July 2013 to 126p now \u2013 a decline of more than 80%. In the City, many analysts doubt that the company can ever recover. \u201cIf there is one person who can turn around a sinking ship it is probably Rupert,\u201d one told me. \u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t be the first good manager to meet a bad company.\u201d For most of us, however, the questions are different. How did Serco get so big in the first place? Is it worth saving at all? * * * Hiring private companies and self-interested individuals to deliver public services is an old, if charged, arrangement. For centuries, kings and queens had no option but to contract out courts, taxes, roads, prisons, to nobles and business folk. The spectre of \u201cold corruption\u201d \u2013 a deadening lattice of sweetheart deals, public offices traded for personal profit \u2013 was a permanent fixture at British elections until the mid-19th century. The emergence of the welfare state and large government bureaucracies helped to banish this tension, and to incubate popular distrust of private actors operating in the public realm. The rise of modern government outsourcing has its origins in business theory. In 1937, Ronald Coase, a young left-leaning lecturer at the London School of Economics, published a short paper called The Nature of the Firm, in which he considered why companies contracted out some of their functions, but did others in-house. \u201cWhy is not all production carried on by one big firm?\u201d he asked. Coase developed the idea that organisations are constantly searching for a balance between the \u201ctransaction costs\u201d involved in hiring external suppliers to do certain tasks and the increased potential for mistakes, waste, and the \u201cdecreasing returns to the entrepreneur function\u201d if a company tries to do everything itself. After the war, Coase, who later won the Nobel prize for economics, moved to the University of Chicago. He gave up on socialism and his work became influential among a new generation of free-market theorists keen to question the preference of large organisations \u2013 particularly governments \u2013 to direct their own affairs rather than seeking the skills and competitive pricing of the open market. They first made the case for outsourcing in bins. During the gloomy, stagnant days of big government in the 1970s, economists crisscrossed the US, Europe and Japan to find out what happened when cities hired private companies to collect their rubbish. It was a no-brainer. In the US, Steve Savas, a champion of privatisation who later joined the Reagan administration, found that New York\u2019s sanitation department only worked half the time. A team in Japan recorded savings of 124% when towns outsourced their refuse services. Private companies were more productive and had better trucks. In the mid-1980s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies carried out a survey of 309 British councils and found average savings of 22%, and no reduction in quality, when they used private dustbin men. This evidence became an important basis for the 1988 Local Government Act, which introduced competitive tendering for around \u00a32.5bn in local services in the UK, and launched the British outsourcing market. Nicholas Ridley, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s environment secretary, dreamed of town councils that met once a year to sign a bunch of contracts, and then went home again. Serco was ready and waiting \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t called Serco yet. Until 1987, it was RCA Services Ltd, the British arm of a fading American conglomerate. The Radio Corporation of America had grown to subsume everything from hire car companies (Hertz) to publishing houses (Random House). Its electronic services division in the UK was a small, modestly profitable corner of the business. It made money maintaining two very large military facilities that it had built for the British government: the nation\u2019s ballistic missile early warning system, at RAF Fylingdales on the North York moors; and a secret state-of-the-art radar at Orford Ness, the UK\u2019s atomic weapons research base in Suffolk. When Thatcher extended her outsourcing campaign to central government departments, RCA\u2019s deals with the Ministry of Defence became prototypes for civil servants across Whitehall. The managers at RCA paused to reconsider their own work as well. They thought of themselves as scientists and engineers \u2013 Richard White, one of Serco\u2019s founders, who joined RCA in 1970, had trained as a chemist \u2013 but more than half of the company\u2019s 700 employees at RAF Fylingdales had more routine jobs. They looked after the grounds, the post, the canteen. The art, it turned out, was in running the people, not the radar. \u201cWe reinvented ourselves as a management organisation,\u201d White told me. In 1984, RCA won the MoD\u2019s first official outsourcing contract, to operate a big supply depot at RAF Quedgeley, in Gloucestershire. \u201cWe had never run a store in our lives,\u201d said White. But that didn\u2019t matter. The RAF\u2019s storekeepers, who transferred into the new company, knew how to do that. Three years later, White helped to lead a management buyout, and RCA Services Ltd became Serco. The early years of Serco were characterised by a sense of limitlessness. There was no end to what governments could, in theory, contract out. \u201cIt just felt like the whole world was opening up,\u201d White told me, \u201cand we seemed to have the right formula to meet it.\u201d The company assumed the shape it more or less holds today \u2013 a small head office overseeing hundreds of Serco outposts, teams of 30 or 50 or 100, out running some corner of what used to be a state concern: the display boards on the M25, a prison in New Zealand, a road tunnel in Hong Kong. From the start, contract managers were encouraged to think of themselves as their own bosses, with their own businesses to run. Back at headquarters, a team of 20 or so, led by a group of founding directors known as the \u201cgang of four\u201d, bid for new work, and reimagined the future of public services. The company set up a thinktank, the Serco Institute, which studied the outsourcing of the past \u2013 18th-century contracts to transport convicts to Australia \u2013 and public services overseas. The gang came to see the border between the public and private sector as a cultural artefact: strongly held, but always shifting. \u201cJust a movable line,\u201d according to White. In Denmark, for instance, emergency services have been privately delivered since the 1920s, but care for the elderly remains overwhelmingly a state concern. In Sweden, the opposite is true: large-scale outsourcing of care services began in the 1990s, but nobody would dare touch the state\u2019s fire engines or ambulances. Serco\u2019s confidence, research and omnivorousness distinguished it from its rivals. Rentokil did cleaning; G4S did security; Capita did IT; Serco did anything and everything \u2013 and its panache in the bidding process meant that it often beat out competition from specialist firms. For a long time the company had a formidable \u201cwin rate\u201d, securing 70% of the contracts it bid for. In 1989, Serco had 3,000 employees and revenues of \u00a359m. Ten years later, it had 27,000 employees and revenues of more than \u00a3800m. By that time, New Labour had loosed the second great wave of outsourcing across Britain\u2019s public services \u2013 although now under a rubric of improving choice and value for money for citizens, rather than the overt Thatcherite goal of dismantling the state. Again, Serco was on hand to pick up the work. The company got involved in privately financed hospitals, prisons and military facilities; took over failing local education authorities in Bradford and Walsall; and won its first major immigration contract, to run the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre, in 2006. Serco sent managers abroad, to win transport, science and prison work in Australia and the US. For a while, the company had 47 staff in Antarctica. It administered Canadian driving tests. It became responsible for setting Greenwich Mean Time. The graphs in its annual reports \u2013 revenues, profits, dividends \u2013 resembled endless staircases, disappearing upwards. Serco became an international business that claimed to have squared the circle of public service and private gain. In 2005, its revenues leapt by almost 40% to \u00a32.2bn. Hyman was the perfect frontman. He made success sound inevitable. \u201cWe can quadruple and it won\u2019t affect the model at all,\u201d he told Management Today in 2007. \u201cWe could become a multinational with hundreds of thousands of workers and it still wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d For this article, I spoke to nurses, porters, cleaners, swimming teachers, train managers and prison guards who worked for Serco, and at its best, they described a company that made steady profits delivering public services with more care than the state ever did. \u201cI made more of a difference than in any other period of my life,\u201d said Lee Barnes, a former prison governor who joined Serco and saw the company give prisoners keys to their cells and guards being addressed by their first names. \u201cThey encouraged us. They allowed us to do that.\u201d Another former employee, who had been a trade union official, was proud that Serco has never faced a strike on its contracts. \u201cThey had this mindset that public sectors were good people surrounded by bad systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a brilliant paradigm.\u201d In March 2013, two months before the tagging scandal broke, Serco reported revenues of \u00a34.9bn and profits of \u00a3302m, the highest in the company\u2019s 25-year history. * * * When Soames started work at Serco, he had a clear idea of what he expected to find. \u201cBig reputational damage,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut fundamentally the business would be very sound.\u201d Within a week or two, however, he sensed that Serco was in a much more fragile state than it appeared. The company\u2019s sales forecasts for the year were unravelling, and its profits were declining at an alarming rate \u2013 in a way that far exceeded the expected impact from the tagging scandal and negative headlines of 2013. On 1 May, officially his first day in the job, Soames issued a profits warning and launched an emergency fundraising of \u00a3160m to keep the company ahead of its debts. \u201cIt became obvious,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat the world was falling out of its bottom.\u201d Soames spent the first 16 years of his career at GEC \u2013 the General Electric Company plc \u2013 the British electronics giant, and came to revere its legendary and prickly chief executive, Arnold Weinstock. At its height, GEC consisted of 180 companies and had a workforce of 250,000. For three decades, Weinstock ruled this empire from a set of dimly lit offices in Knightsbridge decorated with pictures of racehorses. The key to the operation was a set of standardised monthly reports filed by every GEC business: eight ratios (profit margin, staff turnover and so on) on the first page; raw figures on the second page; a written commentary thereafter. Weinstock spent hours each day scouring these documents, covering them in red ink, picking up the telephone, firing people if necessary. At the end of the day, he made a point of switching the lights out himself. Soames has replicated GEC\u2019s reporting system wherever he has worked. (He has two photographs in his dressing room, one of Weinstock, the other of his father.) When he arrived at Serco, the first thing he asked for was a copy of the monthly accounts. They did not exist. (Because Serco\u2019s contracts are long-term \u2013 most of them last between three and seven years \u2013 the company had only ever collected its financial data every quarter.) Next, Soames asked to see a database of the company\u2019s order book of 700 contracts, showing which ones were in profit, and which were loss-making. That did not exist either. As the incoming chief executive, part of Soames\u2019s job was to reassure a demoralised workforce, but he was taken aback by how little Serco knew about its own business. \u201cWhen you see things that may be deeply shocking,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou can\u2019t show your shock.\u201d In the meantime, the bad news kept arriving. Experienced staff were jumping ship. Serco\u2019s damaged reputation meant it was losing outsourcing bids that it would normally win, and there was a troubling drip-drip of allegations from some of the company\u2019s most sensitive contracts. These included Yarl\u2019s Wood, where Serco detains female asylum seekers on behalf of the government. Its staff have been accused of sexual abuse and 10 guards were fired last year. \u201cI was counting my days on the basis of how many really, really shitty bits of news happened a day, and it used to be four,\u201d said Soames. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had my four bits of bad news, I knew something was wrong. I knew there was something I didn\u2019t know.\u201d The air slowly cleared. It took two months to build the contract database. (Soames is a nut for spreadsheets and databases: he likes to re-enter the digits himself.) He discovered that Serco operated in 38 different markets, from dog wardens in Birmingham to air traffic control in Baghdad. He hired his former finance director from Aggreko, Angus Cockburn, and brought in 40 accountants from Ernst &amp; Young to perform a triage on Serco\u2019s global order book, looking for hidden risks and possible losses. Soames adopted a voice from Monty Python when he described this process. \u201cBring out yer dead,\u201d he hollered. \u201cSuddenly, these bodies started flying out.\u201d Soames came to see that Serco\u2019s finances were under attack from three different directions. First, there was the continuing fallout from the tagging dispute of the previous year. (In the end, Serco paid back \u00a368.5m for the tagging debacle, and agreed to forgo any future profits on its prisoner escort contract. The Serious Fraud Office investigation into the tagging contract continues.) More broadly, however, the company had not negotiated the economic crisis anywhere like as well as it had claimed. The arrival of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition unleashed Britain\u2019s third great wave of outsourcing since the 1980s \u2013 between 2010 and 2015, the industry doubled in size from \u00a364bn a year to \u00a3120bn as new health, probation and benefit services hit the market \u2013 but many of Serco\u2019s new contracts were hastily designed and bid for, and barely breaking even. The main reason, according to several former directors I spoke to, was a subtle but noticeable shift in the company\u2019s priorities that began in the mid-2000s. Under Hyman, Serco became steadily engrossed by its own financial performance. He set the company an internal goal of joining the FTSE 100 list of the UK\u2019s largest companies, which it achieved in December 2008. During the depths of the global economic downturn, in 2010, the company then set itself a new goal \u2013 to become \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest service company\u201d \u2013 and issued ambitious forecasts for revenue growth and profits by 2012. Chasing these targets in the face of austerity in the UK and the federal shutdown in the US meant expanding into new areas, such as clinical healthcare and large-scale private outsourcing, which Serco had avoided in the past. A former director, who had left Serco and rejoined the company around this time, found many of his colleagues increasingly pressurised and alienated by a culture almost entirely focused on the bottom line. The Serco Institute was shut down. So-called \u201cblack hat conferences\u201d, at which hardened public service managers used to be invited to challenge the optimistic bidding assumptions made by the financial teams at headquarters either did not take place, or were formalities, dominated by bid teams. \u201cIt was all these commercial guys, just modelling it without any notion of what would happen,\u201d the director told me. By 2014, Serco was managing to lose money on an outsourcing deal with Hertfordshire county council \u2013 the kind of work it had done for a generation. More worrying, even, than either of these, Soames discovered that scattered throughout its books, Serco also had a small number of contracts that put it on the hook for potentially unlimited losses. If you spend time with people in the outsourcing industry these days, the subject most of them want to talk about is \u201crisk transfer\u201d. As well as creating money-making opportunities, novel forms of outsourcing contracts in the last decade have also, on occasion, left private companies exposed to extraordinary levels of financial damage and public loathing. Even small miscalculations, or unexpected events, can carry vast consequences. Serco\u2019s rush to growth made it more vulnerable to these risky deals than most, and from the moment he arrived at the company, Soames began to hear more and more about the 14 Armidale patrol boats that it had agreed to supply to the Australian Navy in 2004. The contract was simple enough. Serco had to make the patrol boats available for a total of 3,600 operating days a year. If they broke down, it was Serco\u2019s problem. In the early years, the Armidales made money for Serco, but from 2008 onwards, Australia faced a sudden increase in asylum seekers attempting to reach the country by sea. Between 2007 and 2012, the numbers leapt from 148 to more than 17,000, and the Armidales were the navy\u2019s chosen means to intercept the migrants\u2019 fragile boats as they approached the coast. The patrol boats were driven harder and faster than ever before. They developed corrosion and cracking in their hulls. Amazingly, for several years, Serco was able to offset any losses from the patrol boats because it also had the contracts to detain the asylum seekers in immigration camps once they landed in Australia. For this work, it was paid on a volume basis \u2013 per asylum seeker. The surge in refugees made these contracts the most profitable in Serco\u2019s entire global portfolio, bringing in \u00a3450m in 2013. But from the July of that year, a dramatic change in Australia\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 under which all \u201cillegal maritime arrivals\u201d would now be detained in Papua New Guinea \u2013 meant that Serco faced a double blow: fewer asylum seekers came, and the Armidales still required expensive maintenance. To add a further, mind-altering twist: it was possible that some of those immigrants would now head for Britain, where Serco also had contracts to provide temporary accommodation to asylum seekers \u2013 but because it had negotiated those deals poorly, it was now losing money on every person that it housed in the UK. \u201cIt is called falling off the swing,\u201d said Soames, when he tried to explain all this to me, \u201cand getting hit on the back of the head by the roundabout.\u201d There are times, when considering Serco, that it begins to resemble Milo Minderbinder\u2019s syndicate, M&amp;M Enterprises, in the novel Catch-22, which starts out trading melons and sardines between opposing armies in the second world war, and ends up conducting bombing raids for commercial reasons. If you are going to make money in conflict, or the messy affairs of human life, Milo reasons, you might as well play as many sides of the action as possible. \u201cIn a democracy, the government is the people,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe\u2019re people aren\u2019t we? So we might as well keep the money and eliminate the middle man.\u201d Last autumn, Soames and Cockburn concluded that a handful of contracts \u2013 led by the Armidales, and the deal to house asylum seekers in the UK \u2013 could cost Serco up to \u00a3500m in losses, which posed a mortal threat to the business. They began a series of weekly meetings with officials at the Cabinet Office to brief them on the company\u2019s financial state. According to Soames, these conversations prompted the government to develop a contingency plan in case Serco went bankrupt. On 10 November, Soames announced a new strategy for the company: it would be simpler, and smaller, and serve governments only. The moves into healthcare and business outsourcing were to be abandoned and sold off. (In 2015, Serco expects to have revenues of \u00a33.5bn, around two-thirds of what it was making at its peak.) The company would sell its recent acquisitions, shedding tens of thousands of employees. Soames also revealed the scale of Serco\u2019s losses for the first time: a total of \u00a31.3bn \u2013 the equivalent of its last 20 years of profits combined. * * * Soames and I spent several afternoons together in May and June, talking about what had gone wrong at Serco. Often we met in his seventh-floor office near Victoria. He always wore the same uniform: dark suit, braces, specially tailored blue herringbone shirts with the words \u201cSerco \u2013 and proud of it\u201d sewn into the right side of his chest. Since the tagging scandal and the misreporting of statistics on its Cornwall healthcare contract in 2012, Serco has also been stripped of its responsibility to sterilise medical equipment at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, western Australia, and has been criticised by human rights groups for its treatment of asylum seekers in both Australia and the UK. (In March, the company launched an independent review, led by a former barrister, Kate Lampard, of conditions at Yarl\u2019s Wood.) One subject we kept returning to was whether the company\u2019s fixation with growth \u2013 its compulsion, publicly and internally, to meet the revenue \u201ccommitments\u201d set by its top management \u2013 had contributed to its ethical and performance failures. Soames\u2019s essential argument was that the two were unrelated. \u201cI think you can construct a story linking the pressure for financial performance to those ethical breaches. I personally think that is wrong,\u201d he said. But Soames\u2019s language wavered. Sometimes when we talked, Serco\u2019s profit targets and the level of care it put into its public services existed in \u201cparallel universes\u201d. Other times there was \u201ca tenuous connection\u201d. Once Soames acknowledged that \u201cone made the other worse\u201d. When I told him about a Serco manager I had spoken to in Cornwall, who described staff in tears every day in early 2012 as they contended with unrealistic financial demands from head office and a healthcare contract they were struggling desperately to meet, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He did not pretend that the question was straightforward. \u201cI don\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, \u2018Oh well, sorted that one then,\u2019\u201d he said. The restless dynamic between corporate profit and public service lies at the heart of why many of us feel anxious about outsourcing. The dice seem loaded from the start. People at Serco used to puzzle over this mistrust. \u201cI think the public is divided,\u201d one of the company\u2019s former board members told me. We hate waste, he explained. We tend to approve of competitive tendering. We acknowledge the existence of good, vocationally driven private actors in the public realm, like GPs. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the board member went on, \u201cpeople are deeply suspicious of the profit motive. They know how powerful the profit motive is and they worry if you get the incentives wrong that will produce horrible consequences.\u201d Outsourcers also threaten us because their growth entails the dismantling of something that was familiar. Public sector monopolies may not have always been effective, but at least they came with a story, an implied commitment to a common cause. They were, in some inescapable sense, ours. By contrast, the rise of the UK\u2019s public services industry \u2013 which now employs more than a million people and is the world\u2019s second largest, after America\u2019s \u2013 is an experiment that has been conducted largely without a narrative, and whose principal agents are large companies that belong to their shareholders. They are, in some inescapable sense, not ours. (Serco\u2019s largest investors, by way of example, are hedge funds, American value investors and the Singaporean government.) Market forces, transaction costs and Coasian bargaining theory do not care if we believe in them or not. Politicians do not help much. They do not celebrate or explain outsourcing, even as the consensus solidifies about the \u201cmixed economy\u201d required to deliver Britain\u2019s public services to an ageing population unwilling to pay higher taxes. All the main parties are signed up. They just don\u2019t like to talk about it. Even Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are Serco customers: they unveiled the company\u2019s new contract to run the Caledonian Sleeper service in March. The experiment proceeds. The stakes get higher. * * * Since March, and the conclusion of Serco\u2019s latest fundraising from its shareholders, Soames has been able to get out and about more. He tries to visit one of the company\u2019s contracts every week. On a recent Friday morning, he picked me up from a station near where he lives with his family in Buckinghamshire (Soames keeps a small mixed farm: \u201cTwelve Sussex cows, plus a bull\u201d) and drove us to RAF Benson, in Oxfordshire, where Serco trains helicopter pilots for the armed forces in computer simulators. On the way, we talked about his childhood. Soames spent many days at Chartwell, the Churchill family home, as a young boy, and remembers being dandled on the great man\u2019s knee. The legacy, more than anything, is of industry: all those books, all those paintings, all those wars. \u201cIt was an immense thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthis prodigious work ethic \u2026\u201d These days, Soames works seven days a week, five or six hours on Saturdays and Sundays. His staff wake up to emails and memos \u2013 noodlings \u2013 time-stamped at 6am, or 10pm. At the helicopter base, Soames busied himself in the arcana of outsourcing. At RAF Benson, where Serco earns around \u00a34m a year on a contract it has held since 1997, the company is trying to supply the same amount of flight training to the MoD with fewer pilots. Soames spent the morning talking to the contract manager about shift patterns and the cost of helicopter earphones. He tried out the flight simulator, rejected his instructor\u2019s suggestion that he use the autopilot, and crashed in a field. \u201cAnd it was all going so swimmingly,\u201d he said. After the screen froze, Soames asked to be taken upstairs to see the servers. He stood with his hands on his hips, facing a bank of humming machines, as if he might find the glitch with his own eyes. At lunchtime, the Serco staff gathered in a meeting room and ate from a cold buffet. Everywhere Soames goes in the company, he gives a stump speech about what went wrong, and how he is trying to fix it, which lasts about seven minutes. Then he asks for questions. Consciously or not, Soames often slips in military references when he speaks. At an in-house awards ceremony in May, he compared the company\u2019s shareholders to Von Bl\u00fccher\u2019s cavalry at Waterloo. He always closes with the same words: \u201cSomeone once said, and I can\u2019t think who: \u2018This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u2019\u201d At RAF Benson, the pilots chuckled, but the conversation quickly turned serious. They wanted to know what Soames was doing to stop the bean-counters from taking over the company again. They wanted to know if the political tide might turn against outsourcing one day. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to pay more tax,\u201d said Soames. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Towards the end, one pilot with a direct manner told Soames they had been treated like \u201ctoilet cleaners\u201d by the previous management and asked about the estimated \u00a34m pay-off that Hyman received when he left. For a moment, the room went quiet. \u201cI have no problem with you asking the question just as you are going to have no problem with me not answering it,\u201d said Soames. He spoke carefully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved. I wasn\u2019t there, and you know what, I couldn\u2019t give a damn. I intend to be different. And that is not to say the past was right or wrong, but I am not the same.\u201d Later, driving back to the station, I wondered whether we will look back on this moment, in the early 21st century \u2013 like we look back on the 1970s, or the 18th century \u2013 and be astonished by a single company doing so many things, in so many places, for and to so many citizens. Soames was on his way home to work for a few more hours. When you run a state within a state, there is always something demanding your attention. \u201cIt sounds pompous,\u201d he said to me once, \u201cbut I feel that everything I have done previously was building up to do this.\u201d That afternoon, unusually, Soames\u2019s voice carried an edge of tiredness. We pulled up at the station to wait for my train. I asked him if he thought he would ever miss this \u2013 the ongoing sense of crisis, a sceptical public, the darkness before the dawn \u2013 and he covered his face with his hands. \u201cFuck no,\u201d he said. Soames slumped in his seat and he started to laugh. \u201cOh, God,\u201d he guffawed. \u201cOh, God.\u201d But wouldn\u2019t he be bored, I said, if all was well in the world of Serco? \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening. I don\u2019t see that for a long time,\u201d said Soames. \u201cI will get chucked out before that.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread This piece was amended on 2 July to correct an error: RAF Benson is in Oxfordshire, not Gloucestershire.

      "body": "<p>Serco used to be the biggest company you had never heard of. For three decades it grew in the borderlands between the state and society, the government and us. Its name stands for \u201cservice company\u201d and Serco, which combined great ambition with a desire to be unseen, wanted to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It was as much a formula as a company: a way to implement outsourced public services on behalf of governments, but with the elan of a restless entrepreneur. It didn\u2019t matter what the service was, where it had to happen, or to whom it was delivered. Serco started out operating radars in Yorkshire and traffic lights in London, but it came to work with schoolchildren and doctors, commuters and prisoners, pilots and refugees. It was designed to be limitless, and to grow for ever. At its peak, Serco had a workforce of 125,000, contracts on four continents, and revenues of \u00a35bn. But in 2013, the formula faltered. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/29/serco-biggest-company-never-heard-of\">Everybody heard about Serco</a>, and the roof fell in.</p> <p>The trouble started in the spring. A young civil servant, a fast-streamer in the Ministry of Justice, noticed strange numbers in the documents submitted by Serco and G4S (another large outsourcing company) as the firms prepared to renew two <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/19/offender-electronic-tagging-serco-repay-68m-overcharging\">electronic tagging</a> contracts that they held with the British government. Since 2005, the two companies had earned around \u00a3700m from monitoring thousands of criminals, suspects and recently released convicts via tracking devices attached to their ankles \u2013 a practice introduced by the Home Office to reduce prison costs in 1999. But according to the junior civil servant, whose findings were initially dismissed, they were overcharging the state.</p> <p>The paperwork that embodies government outsourcing, the physical contracts themselves, tells you a lot about how vexatious the whole business is. Capturing exactly what the state wants done on its behalf \u2013 the running of a railway system, the rehabilitation of prisoners \u2013 can produce dizzying piles of paper for even mundane tasks. The government chivvies its contractors to do a thousand things correctly. Private companies seek to minimise their risks, and ensure a quiet profit at the end of the day. Everyone covers their arse furiously. The documents that emerge are hundreds of pages long, dense with KPIs (key performance indicators) and SLAs (service level agreements) and kept secret from the customers \u2013 us, the public \u2013 whom they are supposed to benefit. Once they are signed, they are rarely looked at again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2015/jul/20/sercogroup\">Can Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson save Serco? And is it worth saving? - Podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the tagging contracts, it was decided that it was up to the crown, and not G4S or Serco, to decide when individuals should be fitted with a tag. This made sense, but it gave rise to an aberration. The companies came to regard monitoring cases as open or closed on the basis of letters they received from the courts and prisons, rather than anything to do with the physical fitting or taking off of tags. They billed the state until they had a document telling them not to, even if the subjects had died, disappeared or were no longer wearing a tag. G4S\u2019s computers were set to continue billing to 2020; Serco\u2019s to the year 3000.</p> <p>Over the years, letters got lost, notifications were not followed up, and these cases accreted. No one checked the contract. Serco charged the Ministry of Justice \u00a315,500 for five years of monitoring a suspect they never managed to locate in the first place. When the anomalies came to light in 2013, they showed that the companies had invoiced the taxpayer for millions of pounds\u2019 worth of nonexistent work. \u201cYou are charging us for people who are dead,\u201d as one Cabinet Office official involved in the subsequent showdown told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the contract says you can, it is a wrong thing.\u201d Serco and G4S were banned from bidding on new government work for six months, while investigations into their other contracts were carried out. The Serious Fraud Office got involved.</p> <p>The revelations hit Serco particularly hard. The British central government provides a quarter of its global revenues. The idea that the company was ripping off its most important customer \u2013 \u201cthe goose that laid the golden egg\u201d, as Serco executives sometimes called it \u2013 panicked investors. The share price slid. Then, in late August, the Ministry of Justice announced that the police were looking into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/28/police-serco-alleged-fraud\">\u201cpotentially fraudulent behaviour\u201d</a> on a second Serco contract: this time a \u00a3285m deal to transport prisoners to and from court in London and East Anglia.</p> <p>A sense of crisis enveloped the company. Investors, politicians and the press connected what had previously been isolated controversies \u2013 in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/20/serco-nhs-false-data-gps\">Tthe Guardian revealed</a> that Serco had altered statistics and mismanaged an out-of-hours healthcare contract in Cornwall \u2013 into a pattern of failures and dishonesty. For those already suspicious of Britain\u2019s outsourcing complex, Serco came to represent everything that was wrong with it: anonymous, omnipresent, and playing us all for fools. In the space of five months, \u00a3500m was wiped from the company\u2019s stock market value. On 23 October, Chris Hyman, the company\u2019s chief executive \u2013 a charismatic South African who had been at Serco since it was founded \u2013 resigned. \u201cThe best way for the company to move forward,\u201d he said, \u201cis for me to step back.\u201d (Hyman did not respond to requests for comment .)</p> <p>Internally, Serco reeled. The company had always exuded a moral confidence that was unusual in an industry best known for cost-cutting. Hyman was an evangelical Christian. He tithed, donating part of his salary to his local Pentecostal church, and fasted once a week. Employees were rewarded for \u201cliving Serco\u2019s values\u201d and managers were given \u201ccommitments\u201d rather than budgets or financial targets to meet each year. The tagging scandal cast all that in doubt. \u201cSerco\u2019s ethical compass needed to be reoriented,\u201d said Alastair Lyons, the company\u2019s chairman at the time, who was in charge of finding Hyman\u2019s successor. Over the course of the winter, the board came to believe that they had found the man to do it, and on February 28 2014, Serco appointed its new chief executive, Rupert Soames, on a pay package worth more than \u00a32m a year.</p> <p>Soames, who is 56, is regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most capable businessmen. Before taking the job at Serco, he ran a Scottish company called<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/aggreko\"> Aggreko</a> that makes diesel generators and supplies temporary power projects around the world. Soames joined Aggreko in 2003, after its previous chief executive was killed in a car crash, and led the firm through an impressive decade of growth, during which its profits, sales and workforce had multiplied many times over.</p> <p>Whether he likes it or not, however, Soames also stands for something else. Choosing him was an opportunity for Serco to revive itself at the well of the British establishment. Soames\u2019s eldest brother is Sir Nicholas Soames, a former Conservative defence minister. His father was Sir Christopher Soames, an ambassador to France and the last governor of Rhodesia. His mother, Mary, learned to swear while commanding an anti-aircraft battery in Hyde Park during the blitz. His grandfather was Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Merely being around Soames \u2013 who is bulky, self-assured, and often speaks in similes that involve things like spaniels, grandmothers, rhododendrons and oysters \u2013 evokes sensations of an earlier, stronger Britain. Sentences come heavy<strong> </strong>with<strong> </strong><em>italics</em><strong> </strong>and euphemism, sometimes both.<strong> </strong>(I once heard Soames characterise the royal family as \u201c<em>that side of things</em>\u201d).<strong> </strong>His default mood is one of loud amusement. At Oxford, where Soames was president of the union, he spent most of his time spinning records. He drove down to London twice a week to play the decks at Annabel\u2019s, and brought the beats to Charles and Diana\u2019s engagement party in 1981. He might have been the poshest DJ in the world. He loves control, and he loves to lead. When Lyons met Soames, he perceived \u201ca streak running through him of service and duty\u201d, and he is not the only one. \u201cIt is something almost military,\u201d an old friend, who has known Soames since university, told me. \u201cIt cascades down from his grandfather. He likes to look over his shoulder and see 10,000 people marching.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c273c2d767f6978a7e4b9220eaa405ceb56d40a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435749791789/a64e2544-c903-437d-ba0a-0715e6a59b60-251x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rupert Soames\" width=\"251\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, is regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most capable businessmen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soames himself hates this kind of talk. He abhors <em>swanking</em> of any kind, and bristles at casual references to his background. \u201cSomebody asked me: \u2018What\u2019s it like being Churchill\u2019s grandson?\u2019\u201d he said to me once, putting on a nasal voice to indicate that this was an annoying question. \u201cAnd I say, I have got no fucking idea because I have never been anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he possesses an innate relish for the work of the state, what he calls \u201cthe public service bit\u201d. Soames went for the Serco job on the day he heard that Hyman had resigned. And despite working in the private sector all his life, there is a sense that in the unglamorous world of public sector outsourcing \u2013 thankless, complex and human \u2013 Soames has joined the family tradition at last. \u201cRupert,\u201d as his older brother Sir Nicholas, put it, \u201chas the architecture.\u201d Since taking over at Serco, he has begun to replace the company\u2019s corporate speak of \u201cvalue creation\u201d and \u201cmarket opportunities\u201d with a more plain-spoken dialect of people and their problems. \u201cThis is called government. This is called public affairs,\u201d Soames said once, when we were discussing Serco\u2019s high-profile contracts to detain asylum seekers in the UK and Australia. He could have been speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> <p>For all the assurance that he has brought, however, and the shadow of his forefathers, no one knows whether Soames can save Serco. About a month after he got the job, he went to see Margaret Hodge, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, parliament\u2019s main watchdog over the UK\u2019s \u00a3120bn outsourcing industry. \u201cHe said he was going to turn it all around,\u201d she told me. \u201cAll the gossip to me was that he was going to go bust.\u201d</p> <p>The company has staggered from month to month. Since 2013, Serco has issued three profit warnings, raised \u00a3715m from its shareholders to meet its debts, and announced losses of more than \u00a31bn. Its share price has traced a long and dismal totter, from 682p in July 2013 to 126p now \u2013 a decline of more than 80%. In the City, many analysts doubt that the company can ever recover. \u201cIf there is one person who can turn around a sinking ship it is probably Rupert,\u201d one told me. \u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t be the first good manager to meet a bad company.\u201d For most of us, however, the questions are different. How did Serco get so big in the first place? Is it worth saving at all?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Hiring private companies</strong> and self-interested individuals to deliver public services is an old, if charged, arrangement. For centuries, kings and queens had no option but to contract out courts, taxes, roads, prisons, to nobles and business folk. The spectre of \u201cold corruption\u201d \u2013 a deadening lattice of sweetheart deals, public offices traded for personal profit \u2013 was a permanent fixture at British elections until the mid-19th century. The emergence of the welfare state and large government bureaucracies helped to banish this tension, and to incubate popular distrust of private actors operating in the public realm.</p> <p>The rise of modern government outsourcing has its origins in business theory. In 1937, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/ronald-coase-chicago-school-economist-died\">Ronald Coase</a>, a young left-leaning lecturer at the London School of Economics, published a short paper called The Nature of the Firm, in which he considered why companies contracted out some of their functions, but did others in-house. \u201cWhy is not all production carried on by one big firm?\u201d he asked. Coase developed the idea that organisations are constantly searching for a balance between the \u201ctransaction costs\u201d involved in hiring external suppliers to do certain tasks and the increased potential for mistakes, waste, and the \u201cdecreasing returns to the entrepreneur function\u201d if a company tries to do everything itself. After the war, Coase, who later won the Nobel prize for economics, moved to the University of Chicago. He gave up on socialism and his work became influential among a new generation of free-market theorists keen to question the preference of large organisations \u2013 particularly governments \u2013 to direct their own affairs rather than seeking the skills and competitive pricing of the open market.</p> <p>They first made the case for outsourcing in bins. During the gloomy, stagnant days of big government in the 1970s, economists crisscrossed the US, Europe and Japan to find out what happened when cities hired private companies to collect their rubbish. It was a no-brainer. In the US, Steve Savas, a champion of privatisation who later joined the Reagan administration, found that New York\u2019s sanitation department only worked half the time. A team in Japan recorded savings of 124% when towns outsourced their refuse services. Private companies were more productive and had better trucks. In the mid-1980s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies carried out a survey of 309 British councils and found average savings of 22%, and no reduction in quality, when they used private dustbin men. This evidence became an important basis for the 1988 Local Government Act, which introduced competitive tendering for around \u00a32.5bn in local services in the UK, and launched the British outsourcing market. Nicholas Ridley, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s environment secretary, dreamed of town councils that met once a year to sign a bunch of contracts, and then went home again.</p> <p>Serco was ready and waiting \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t called Serco yet. Until 1987, it was RCA Services Ltd, the British arm of a fading American conglomerate. The Radio Corporation of America had grown to subsume everything from hire car companies (Hertz) to publishing houses (Random House). Its electronic services division in the UK was a small, modestly profitable corner of the business. It made money maintaining two very large military facilities that it had built for the British government: the nation\u2019s ballistic missile early warning system, at RAF Fylingdales on the North York moors; and a secret state-of-the-art radar at Orford Ness, the UK\u2019s atomic weapons research base in Suffolk. When Thatcher extended her outsourcing campaign to central government departments, RCA\u2019s deals with the Ministry of Defence became prototypes for civil servants across Whitehall.</p> <p>The managers at RCA paused to reconsider their own work as well. They thought of themselves as scientists and engineers \u2013 Richard White, one of Serco\u2019s founders, who joined RCA in 1970, had trained as a chemist \u2013 but more than half of the company\u2019s 700 employees at RAF Fylingdales had more routine jobs. They looked after the grounds, the post, the canteen. The art, it turned out, was in running the people, not the radar. \u201cWe reinvented ourselves as a management organisation,\u201d White told me. In 1984, RCA won the MoD\u2019s first official outsourcing contract, to operate a big supply depot at RAF Quedgeley, in Gloucestershire. \u201cWe had never run a store in our lives,\u201d said White. But that didn\u2019t matter. The RAF\u2019s storekeepers, who transferred into the new company, knew how to do that. Three years later, White helped to lead a management buyout, and RCA Services Ltd became Serco.</p> <p>The early years of Serco were characterised by a sense of limitlessness. There was no end to what governments could, in theory, contract out. \u201cIt just felt like the whole world was opening up,\u201d White told me, \u201cand we seemed to have the right formula to meet it.\u201d The company assumed the shape it more or less holds today \u2013 a small head office overseeing hundreds of Serco outposts, teams of 30 or 50 or 100, out running some corner of what used to be a state concern: the display boards on the M25, a prison in New Zealand, a road tunnel in Hong Kong. From the start, contract managers were encouraged to think of themselves as their own bosses, with their own businesses to run.</p> <p>Back at headquarters, a team of 20 or so, led by a group of founding directors known as the \u201cgang of four\u201d, bid for new work, and reimagined the future of public services. The company set up a thinktank, the Serco Institute, which studied the outsourcing of the past \u2013 18th-century contracts to transport convicts to Australia \u2013 and public services overseas. The gang came to see the border between the public and private sector as a cultural artefact: strongly held, but always shifting. \u201cJust a movable line,\u201d according to White. In Denmark, for instance, emergency services have been privately delivered since the 1920s, but care for the elderly remains overwhelmingly a state concern. In Sweden, the opposite is true: large-scale outsourcing of care services began in the 1990s, but nobody would dare touch the state\u2019s fire engines or ambulances.</p> <p>Serco\u2019s confidence, research and omnivorousness distinguished it from its rivals. Rentokil did cleaning; G4S did security; Capita did IT; Serco did anything and everything \u2013 and its panache in the bidding process meant that it often beat out competition from specialist firms. For a long time the company had a formidable \u201cwin rate\u201d, securing 70% of the contracts it bid for.</p> <p>In 1989, Serco had 3,000 employees and revenues of \u00a359m. Ten years later, it had 27,000 employees and revenues of more than \u00a3800m. By that time, New Labour had loosed the second great wave of outsourcing across Britain\u2019s public services \u2013 although now under a rubric of improving choice and value for money for citizens, rather than the overt Thatcherite goal of dismantling the state.</p> <p>Again, Serco was on hand to pick up the work. The company got involved in privately financed hospitals, prisons and military facilities; took over failing local education authorities in Bradford and Walsall; and won its first major immigration contract, to run the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre, in 2006. Serco sent managers abroad, to win transport, science and prison work in Australia and the US. For a while, the company had 47 staff in Antarctica. It administered Canadian driving tests. It became responsible for setting Greenwich Mean Time. The graphs in its annual reports \u2013 revenues, profits, dividends \u2013 resembled endless staircases, disappearing upwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18a74eadc078d4a1b6cf2cc65473f53cc66b9819\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435749558857/f524ec8a-a963-43ce-897f-e757a532c4b9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Detainees at Yarl's Wood in June 2015.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detainees at Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre in June 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Serco became an international business that claimed to have squared the circle of public service and private gain. In 2005, its revenues leapt by almost 40% to \u00a32.2bn. Hyman was the perfect frontman. He made success sound inevitable. \u201cWe can quadruple and it won\u2019t affect the model at all,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/771019/MT-Interview-Chris-Hyman/\">Management Today in 2007</a>. \u201cWe could become a multinational with hundreds of thousands of workers and it still wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>For this article, I spoke to nurses, porters, cleaners, swimming teachers, train managers and prison guards who worked for Serco, and at its best, they described a company that made steady profits delivering public services with more care than the state ever did. \u201cI made more of a difference than in any other period of my life,\u201d said Lee Barnes, a former prison governor who joined Serco and saw the company give prisoners keys to their cells and guards being addressed by their first names. \u201cThey encouraged us. They allowed us to do that.\u201d Another former employee, who had been a trade union official, was proud that Serco has never faced a strike on its contracts. \u201cThey had this mindset that public sectors were good people surrounded by bad systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a brilliant paradigm.\u201d In March 2013, two months before the tagging scandal broke, Serco reported revenues of \u00a34.9bn and profits of \u00a3302m, the highest in the company\u2019s 25-year history.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p><strong>When Soames started work at Serco,</strong> he had a clear idea of what he expected to find. \u201cBig reputational damage,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut fundamentally the business would be very sound.\u201d</p> <p>Within a week or two, however, he sensed that Serco was in a much more fragile state than it appeared. The company\u2019s sales forecasts for the year were unravelling, and its profits were declining at an alarming rate \u2013 in a way that far exceeded the expected impact from the tagging scandal and negative headlines of 2013. On 1 May, officially his first day in the job, Soames issued a profits warning and launched an emergency fundraising of \u00a3160m to keep the company ahead of its debts. \u201cIt became obvious,\u201d he told me, \u201cthat the world was falling out of its bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Soames spent the first 16 years of his career at GEC \u2013 the General Electric Company plc \u2013 the British electronics giant, and came to revere its legendary and prickly chief executive, Arnold Weinstock. At its height, GEC consisted of 180 companies and had a workforce of 250,000. For three decades, Weinstock ruled this empire from a set of dimly lit offices in Knightsbridge decorated with pictures of racehorses. The key to the operation was a set of standardised monthly reports filed by every GEC business: eight ratios (profit margin, staff turnover and so on) on the first page; raw figures on the second page; a written commentary thereafter. Weinstock spent hours each day scouring these documents, covering them in red ink, picking up the telephone, firing people if necessary. At the end of the day, he made a point of switching the lights out himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33cc987c2acc1ab9e9b93bb8023a08581292cf5c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435750206530/3b5adaa5-15f5-455d-9477-66e5c492f109-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Arnold Weinstock.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnold Weinstock ruled the General Electric Company empire from a set of dimly-lit offices in Knightsbridge decorated with pictures of racehorses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soames has replicated GEC\u2019s reporting system wherever he has worked. (He has two photographs in his dressing room, one of Weinstock, the other of his father.) When he arrived at Serco, the first thing he asked for was a copy of the monthly accounts. They did not exist. (Because Serco\u2019s contracts are long-term \u2013 most of them last between three and seven years \u2013 the company had only ever collected its financial data every quarter.) Next, Soames asked to see a database of the company\u2019s order book of 700 contracts, showing which ones were in profit, and which were loss-making. That did not exist either. As the incoming chief executive, part of Soames\u2019s job was to reassure a demoralised workforce, but he was taken aback by how little Serco knew about its own business. \u201cWhen you see things that may be deeply shocking,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou can\u2019t show your shock.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, the bad news kept arriving. Experienced staff were jumping ship. Serco\u2019s damaged reputation meant it was losing outsourcing bids that it would normally win, and there was a troubling drip-drip of allegations from some of the company\u2019s most sensitive contracts. These included Yarl\u2019s Wood, where Serco detains female asylum seekers on behalf of the government. Its staff have been accused of sexual abuse and 10 guards were fired last year. \u201cI was counting my days on the basis of how many really, really shitty bits of news happened a day, and it used to be four,\u201d said Soames. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had my four bits of bad news, I knew something was wrong. I knew there was something I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>The air slowly cleared. It took two months to build the contract database. (Soames is a nut for spreadsheets and databases: he likes to re-enter the digits himself.) He discovered that Serco operated in 38 different markets, from dog wardens in Birmingham to air traffic control in Baghdad. He hired his former finance director from Aggreko, Angus Cockburn, and brought in 40 accountants from Ernst &amp; Young to perform a triage on Serco\u2019s global order book, looking for hidden risks and possible losses. Soames adopted a voice from Monty Python when he described this process. \u201cBring out yer dead,\u201d he hollered. \u201cSuddenly, these bodies started flying out.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soames discovered that Serco operated in 38 markets, from dog wardens in Birmingham to air traffic control in Baghdad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soames came to see that Serco\u2019s finances were under attack from three different directions. First, there was the continuing fallout from the tagging dispute of the previous year. (In the end, Serco paid back \u00a368.5m for the tagging debacle, and agreed to forgo any future profits on its prisoner escort contract. The Serious Fraud Office investigation into the tagging contract continues.) More broadly, however, the company had not negotiated the economic crisis anywhere like as well as it had claimed. The arrival of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition unleashed Britain\u2019s third great wave of outsourcing since the 1980s \u2013 between 2010 and 2015, the industry doubled in size from \u00a364bn a year to \u00a3120bn as new health, probation and benefit services hit the market \u2013 but many of Serco\u2019s new contracts were hastily designed and bid for, and barely breaking even.</p> <p>The main reason, according to several former directors I spoke to, was a subtle but noticeable shift in the company\u2019s priorities that began in the mid-2000s. Under Hyman, Serco became steadily engrossed by its own financial performance. He set the company an internal goal of joining the FTSE 100 list of the UK\u2019s largest companies, which it achieved in December 2008. During the depths of the global economic downturn, in 2010, the company then set itself a new goal \u2013 to become \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest service company\u201d \u2013 and issued ambitious forecasts for revenue growth and profits by 2012. Chasing these targets in the face of austerity in the UK and the federal shutdown in the US meant expanding into new areas, such as clinical healthcare and large-scale private outsourcing, which Serco had avoided in the past.</p> <p>A former director, who had left Serco and rejoined the company around this time, found many of his colleagues increasingly pressurised and alienated by a culture almost entirely focused on the bottom line. The Serco Institute was shut down. So-called \u201cblack hat conferences\u201d, at which hardened public service managers used to be invited to challenge the optimistic bidding assumptions made by the financial teams at headquarters either did not take place, or were formalities, dominated by bid teams. \u201cIt was all these commercial guys, just modelling it without any notion of what would happen,\u201d the director told me. By 2014, Serco was managing to lose money on an outsourcing deal with Hertfordshire county council \u2013 the kind of work it had done for a generation.</p> <p>More worrying, even, than either of these, Soames discovered that scattered throughout its books, Serco also had a small number of contracts that put it on the hook for potentially unlimited losses. If you spend time with people in the outsourcing industry these days, the subject most of them want to talk about is \u201crisk transfer\u201d. As well as creating money-making opportunities, novel forms of outsourcing contracts in the last decade have also, on occasion, left private companies exposed to extraordinary levels of financial damage and public loathing. Even small miscalculations, or unexpected events, can carry vast consequences. Serco\u2019s rush to growth made it more vulnerable to these risky deals than most, and from the moment he arrived at the company, Soames began to hear more and more about the 14 Armidale patrol boats that it had agreed to supply to the Australian Navy in 2004.</p> <p>The contract was simple enough. Serco had to make the patrol boats available for a total of 3,600 operating days a year. If they broke down, it was Serco\u2019s problem. In the early years, the Armidales made money for Serco, but from 2008 onwards, Australia faced a sudden increase in asylum seekers attempting to reach the country by sea. Between 2007 and 2012, the numbers leapt from 148 to more than 17,000, and the Armidales were the navy\u2019s chosen means to intercept the migrants\u2019 fragile boats as they approached the coast. The patrol boats were driven harder and faster than ever before. They developed corrosion and cracking in their hulls. Amazingly, for several years, Serco was able to offset any losses from the patrol boats because it also had the contracts to detain the asylum seekers in immigration camps once they landed in Australia. For this work, it was paid on a volume basis \u2013 per asylum seeker. The surge in refugees made these contracts the most profitable in Serco\u2019s entire global portfolio, bringing in \u00a3450m in 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4f745e4c2ab7ff75c348ebd050aca896285e126\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435753462029/a2b5f9e6-7b2b-492f-8be2-dbc3454101f1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Royal Australian Navy Armidale patrol boat\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Royal Australian Navy Armidale patrol boat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LSIS Yuri Ramsey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But from the July of that year, a dramatic change in Australia\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 under which all<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Refu/Illegal-maritime-arrivals\">\u201cillegal maritime arrivals</a>\u201d would now be detained in Papua New Guinea \u2013 meant that Serco faced a double blow: fewer asylum seekers came, and the Armidales still required expensive maintenance. To add a further, mind-altering twist: it was possible that some of those immigrants would now head for Britain, where Serco also had contracts to provide temporary accommodation to asylum seekers \u2013 but because it had negotiated those deals poorly, it was now <em>losing</em> money on every person that it housed in the UK. \u201cIt is called falling off the swing,\u201d said Soames, when he tried to explain all this to me, \u201cand getting hit on the back of the head by the roundabout.\u201d</p> <p>There are times, when considering Serco, that it begins to resemble Milo Minderbinder\u2019s syndicate, M&amp;M Enterprises, in the novel Catch-22, which starts out trading melons and sardines between opposing armies in the second world war, and ends up conducting bombing raids for commercial reasons. If you are going to make money in conflict, or the messy affairs of human life, Milo reasons, you might as well play as many sides of the action as possible. \u201cIn a democracy, the government is the people,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe\u2019re people aren\u2019t we? So we might as well keep the money and eliminate the middle man.\u201d</p> <p>Last autumn, Soames and Cockburn concluded that a handful of contracts \u2013 led by the Armidales, and the deal to house asylum seekers in the UK \u2013 could cost Serco up to \u00a3500m in losses, which posed a mortal threat to the business. They began a series of weekly meetings with officials at the Cabinet Office to brief them on the company\u2019s financial state. According to Soames, these conversations prompted the government to develop a contingency plan in case Serco went bankrupt.</p> <p>On 10 November, Soames announced a new strategy for the company: it would be simpler, and smaller, and serve governments only. The moves into healthcare and business outsourcing were to be abandoned and sold off. (In 2015, Serco expects to have revenues of \u00a33.5bn, around two-thirds of what it was making at its peak.) The company would sell its recent acquisitions, shedding tens of thousands of employees. Soames also revealed the scale of Serco\u2019s losses for the first time: a total of \u00a31.3bn \u2013 the equivalent of its last 20 years of profits combined.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Soames and I spent several afternoons</strong> together in May and June, talking about what had gone wrong at Serco. Often we met in his seventh-floor office near Victoria. He always wore the same uniform: dark suit, braces, specially tailored blue herringbone shirts with the words \u201cSerco \u2013 and proud of it\u201d sewn into the right side of his chest. Since the tagging scandal and the misreporting of statistics on its Cornwall healthcare contract in 2012, Serco has also been stripped of its responsibility to sterilise medical equipment at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, western Australia, and has been criticised by human rights groups for its treatment of asylum seekers in both Australia and the UK. (In March, the company launched an independent review, led by a former barrister, Kate Lampard, of conditions at Yarl\u2019s Wood.)</p> <p>One subject we kept returning to was whether the company\u2019s fixation with growth \u2013 its compulsion, publicly and internally, to meet the revenue \u201ccommitments\u201d set by its top management \u2013 had contributed to its ethical and performance failures. Soames\u2019s essential argument was that the two were unrelated. \u201cI think you can construct a story linking the pressure for financial performance to those ethical breaches. I personally think that is wrong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Soames\u2019s language wavered. Sometimes when we talked, Serco\u2019s profit targets and the level of care it put into its public services existed in \u201cparallel universes\u201d. Other times there was \u201ca tenuous connection\u201d. Once Soames acknowledged that \u201cone made the other worse<em>\u201d</em>. When I told him about a Serco manager I had spoken to in Cornwall, who described staff in tears every day in early 2012 as they contended with unrealistic financial demands from head office and a healthcare contract they were struggling desperately to meet, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He did not pretend that the question was straightforward. \u201cI don\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, \u2018Oh well, sorted that one then,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>The restless dynamic between corporate profit and public service lies at the heart of why many of us feel anxious about outsourcing. The dice seem loaded from the start. People at Serco used to puzzle over this mistrust. \u201cI think the public is divided,\u201d one of the company\u2019s former board members told me. We hate waste, he explained. We tend to approve of competitive tendering. We acknowledge the existence of good, vocationally driven private actors in the public realm, like GPs. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the board member went on, \u201cpeople are deeply suspicious of the profit motive. They know how powerful the profit motive is and they worry if you get the incentives wrong that will produce horrible consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Outsourcers also threaten us because their growth entails the dismantling of something that was familiar. Public sector monopolies may not have always been effective, but at least they came with a story, an implied commitment to a common cause. They were, in some inescapable sense, <em>ours</em>. By contrast, the rise of the UK\u2019s public services industry \u2013 which now employs more than a million people and is the world\u2019s second largest, after America\u2019s \u2013 is an experiment that has been conducted largely without a narrative, and whose principal agents are large companies that belong to their shareholders. They are, in some inescapable sense, <em>not ours</em>. (Serco\u2019s largest investors, by way of example, are hedge funds, American value investors and the Singaporean government.)</p> <p>Market forces, transaction costs and Coasian bargaining theory do not care if we believe in them or not. Politicians do not help much. They do not celebrate or explain outsourcing, even as the consensus solidifies about the \u201cmixed economy\u201d required to deliver Britain\u2019s public services to an ageing population unwilling to pay higher taxes. All the main parties are signed up. They just don\u2019t like to talk about it. Even Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are Serco customers: they unveiled the company\u2019s new contract to run the Caledonian Sleeper service in March. The experiment proceeds. The stakes get higher.</p> <blockquote> <p>* * * </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Since March, and the conclusion</strong> of Serco\u2019s latest fundraising from its shareholders, Soames has been able to get out and about more. He tries to visit one of the company\u2019s contracts every week. On a recent Friday morning, he picked me up from a station near where he lives with his family in Buckinghamshire (Soames keeps a small mixed farm: \u201cTwelve Sussex cows, plus a bull\u201d) and drove us to RAF Benson, in Oxfordshire, where Serco trains helicopter pilots for the armed forces in computer simulators. On the way, we talked about his childhood. Soames spent many days at Chartwell, the Churchill family home, as a young boy, and remembers being dandled on the great man\u2019s knee. The legacy, more than anything, is of <em>industry</em>: all those books, all those paintings, all those wars. \u201cIt was an immense thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthis prodigious work ethic \u2026\u201d These days, Soames works seven days a week, five or six hours on Saturdays and Sundays. His staff wake up to emails and memos \u2013<strong> </strong><em>noodlings</em><strong> </strong>\u2013 time-stamped at 6am, or 10pm.</p> <p>At the helicopter base, Soames busied himself in the arcana of outsourcing. At RAF Benson, where Serco earns around \u00a34m a year on a contract it has held since 1997, the company is trying to supply the same amount of flight training to the MoD with fewer pilots. Soames spent the morning talking to the contract manager about shift patterns and the cost of helicopter earphones. He tried out the flight simulator, rejected his instructor\u2019s suggestion that he use the autopilot, and crashed in a field. \u201cAnd it was all going so swimmingly,\u201d he said. After the screen froze, Soames asked to be taken upstairs to see the servers. He stood with his hands on his hips, facing a bank of humming machines, as if he might find the glitch with his own eyes.</p> <p>At lunchtime, the Serco staff gathered in a meeting room and ate from a cold buffet. Everywhere Soames goes in the company, he gives a stump speech about what went wrong, and how he is trying to fix it, which lasts about seven minutes. Then he asks for questions. Consciously or not, Soames often slips in military references when he speaks. At an in-house awards ceremony in May, he compared the company\u2019s shareholders to Von Bl\u00fccher\u2019s cavalry at Waterloo. He always closes with the same words: \u201cSomeone once said, and I can\u2019t think who: \u2018This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At RAF Benson, the pilots chuckled, but the conversation quickly turned serious. They wanted to know what Soames was doing to stop the bean-counters from taking over the company again. They wanted to know if the political tide might turn against outsourcing one day. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to pay more tax,\u201d said Soames. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Towards the end, one pilot with a direct manner told Soames they had been treated like \u201ctoilet cleaners\u201d by the previous management and asked about the estimated \u00a34m pay-off that Hyman received when he left.<strong> </strong>For a moment, the room went quiet. \u201cI have no problem with you asking the question just as you are going to have no problem with me not answering it,\u201d said Soames. He spoke carefully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved. I wasn\u2019t there, and you know what, I couldn\u2019t give a damn. I intend to be different. And that is not to say the past was right or wrong, but I am not the same.\u201d</p> <p>Later, driving back to the station, I wondered whether we will look back on this moment, in the early 21st century \u2013 like we look back on the 1970s, or the 18th century \u2013 and be astonished by a single company doing so many things, in so many places, for and to so many citizens. Soames was on his way home to work for a few more hours. When you run a state within a state, there is always something demanding your attention. \u201cIt sounds pompous,\u201d he said to me once, \u201cbut I feel that everything I have done previously was building up to do this.\u201d</p> <p>That afternoon, unusually, Soames\u2019s voice carried an edge of tiredness. We pulled up at the station to wait for my train. I asked him if he thought he would ever miss this \u2013 the ongoing sense of crisis, a sceptical public, the darkness before the dawn \u2013 and he covered his face with his hands. \u201cFuck no,\u201d he said. Soames slumped in his seat and he started to laugh. \u201cOh, God,\u201d he guffawed. \u201cOh, God.\u201d But wouldn\u2019t he be bored, I said, if all was well in the world of Serco? \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening. I don\u2019t see that for a long time,\u201d said Soames. \u201cI will get chucked out before that.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a></p> <ul> <li>This piece was amended on 2 July to correct an error: RAF Benson is in Oxfordshire, not Gloucestershire.
