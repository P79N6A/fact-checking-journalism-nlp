      "bodyText": "The reports this week that ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s might lower Australia\u2019s credit rating highlighted that for the most part talk about government debt by both political parties doesn\u2019t actually have much to do with the state of our economy. When you look at talk about government debt, it\u2019s soon obvious that no one actually argues it is inhibiting economic growth. All the worry is about what might happen in the future \u2013 will we have room for stimulus measures should the economy slow, and rather more abstractly, will our debt level cause the ratings agencies to lower our triple-A credit rating? At the moment, Australia is one of only 10 nations to have a triple A rating from the three agencies of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, Fitch and Moody\u2019s. This week came reports that S&amp;P, which in July put Australia on a negative credit outlook, might use the updated budget figures in December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook as a trigger for the downgrade. While there is a good chance that government revenue will be improved by the recent increases in coal and iron ore prices, Treasury officials told the Senate estimates hearing this week there was a lot of uncertainty about how long those higher prices would remain in place. As such, the number in the Myefo might not show much of a lowering of the deficit, and thus S&amp;P might decide the path back to surplus is too slow or unrealistic and take away our triple-A rating. Yet really we should ask why on Earth does such an agency have so much importance? S&amp;P for example is the only one of the three major credit agencies to not have the US rated triple A. It is frankly absurd to think that the US would be in any way unable to repay its debt given its status as the world\u2019s largest economy with a currency that is far and away the most traded in the world. But now that same agency is looking askance at our own situation, despite our economy growing faster than all but Luxembourg and Sweden among the 10 economies with a triple-A rating, and with the third lowest level of gross government debt of those 10 as well. The concerns of a lowering of our credit rating are both political and economic. A downgrade looks bad for any government, and it was clear in Senate estimates this week that both sides are laying the foundations to blame each other should it occur. But economically the worry is that a downgrade will raise the cost of borrowing for the government, which in turn would do the same for state and local governments and Australian corporations, given the interest rate they pay is linked to that of the government. While inevitably banks would pass on these increased lending costs onto consumers, the reality is no one is quite sure just how much those costs would be \u2013 if any. The new head of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, told the house economics committee soon after taking over the position last month, that the effects of a ratings downgrade on borrowing costs are \u201cquite small\u201d. He suggested that rather than be the main game, that credit ratings were just \u201ca useful reminder that we need to make sure the recurrent budget is on a good path\u201d. But while our government debt remains \u201cadmirable\u201d by international standards, as the secretary of the treasury, John Fraser, noted this week, our levels of private debt are extremely high \u2013 indeed fifth-highest in the world. Worryingly, the IMF in its recent fiscal monitor report noted the level of this debt was a concern for Australia\u2019s ongoing financial stability. Fraser noted this aspect as well in his appearance before the Senate estimates committee, telling the committee that the Treasury, \u201care also conscious that credit rating agencies are focusing on household debt as well as corporate and government debt\u201d. Policies to lower private debt however are much more thin on the ground than are the cries about the need to cut government spending to reduce government debt. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, this week raised the issue in an opinion piece published by Guardian Australia. He highlighted that the ALP\u2019s policy on capital gains tax and negative gearing, which it took to the last election, was the type of policy proscribed by organisations like the IMF to temper our love of taking on more and more private debt. Should S&amp;P downgrade Australia\u2019s credit rating, no doubt almost all commentary and debate will focus on government debt. But regardless of whether or not such a downgrade will cause interest rates for governments and companies to rise, private \u2013 not government \u2013 debt will remain the issue that most urgently needs to be addressed.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up \u00a352bn of losses since it was bailed out eight years ago this month: and when it reports third-quarter results on Friday it is expected to dive even deeper into the red. The bank\u2019s list of woes seem neverending, ranging from a potential \u00a39bn penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago to allegations of bad treatment of small business customers. Its share price is so far below the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has abandoned any attempts to sell off any more shares. RBS\u2019s troubles have prompted one thinktank to argue that it is time for a radical strategy rethink, after the bank scaled itself down from a global business with operations in more than 50 countries to one with a flag in just 13 and a renewed focus on the UK high street. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK government to put all options for the bank\u2019s future back on the table and urgently examine whether there are alternatives that could deliver better value for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d Laurie Macfarlane, an economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), argues in a paper published this weekend. The vote for Brexit has given the NEF fresh impetus in its call for RBS to be broken up into 130 regional UK banks. Macfarlane argues that RBS could turn its focus to \u201clending for investment in production services such as manufacturing, retailing and distribution, telecoms, construction and energy\u201d, which are spread across the UK. \u201cTurning it into a network of local banks could therefore help boost real-economy lending while investing in communities that have been left behind by our London-centric economic model \u2013 exactly the kinds of communities who voted to leave the EU,\u201d he says. It is not the first time that the NEF \u2013 among others \u2013 have called for a rethink of the strategy for RBS. Sir Vince Cable called for the dismantling of the Edinburgh-based bank when he was the business secretary in the coalition government. \u201cAt the very beginning of our government, we should have gone for the breakup option,\u201d the former Liberal Democrat MP says. \u201cThey should be trying to create sensible smaller banks out of the greater whole,\u201d Cable adds. However, he acknowledges he has been told that the cost of breakup would be too high \u2013 illustrated by the problems RBS has experienced in trying to spin off just 300 branches, as stipulated by the EU as punishment for receiving state aid. The difficulty RBS has encountered in selling off these branches, intended to be rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn, was referred to by Hammond when he announced that ambitions to sell off the remaining 73% stake had been put on the back burner. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the disposal of RBS shares at a price that recovers taxpayers\u2019 investment is not practical at the moment,\u201d Hammond said. The shares closed on Friday at 190p. Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, had indicated that selling the government\u2019s stake at a profit was not a priority. He sold 5% at 330p a share \u2013 and a \u00a31bn loss \u2013 in August 2015. Analysts hold out little expectation that the RBS share price will ever get back to 502p. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast by analysts is 180p a share \u2013 and thus, Macfarlane argues, it is time for a rethink: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is no way the taxpayer can make its money back by selling RBS back to the private sector.\u201d The Treasury, though, is unlikely to have much appetite to embark upon a strategy reversal. Osborne commissioned a review into whether RBS should be split up in 2013. It backed off radical action and instead focused on putting \u00a338bn of troublesome assets into an internal bad bank. Ross McEwan, now entering his fourth year as chief executive of RBS, would be unlikely to welcome a full-blown review either. He has embarked on an effort to put a fresh focus on NatWest \u2013 the now-revived brand name for RBS\u2019s high street banking business in England and Wales \u2013 through a new advertising campaign launched last month, and has turned the focus on the remaining businesses, which generate \u00a31bn of profit a quarter. His problem, though, is that those profits are being wiped out by tackling the so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d of the past. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, also points out that RBS is the fastest-growing among its UK peers in terms of lending for mortgages and business. \u201cBut that is being drowned out by the bigger, more volatile, \u2018known unknowns\u2019,\u201d says Gordon. RBS\u2019s problems \u25a0 A settlement, yet to be negotiated, with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged up a decade ago and sold on to consumers. RBS has not been able to estimate the financial impact of this settlement but analysts put figures on it ranging from \u00a34bn to \u00a39bn. \u25a0 The sale of 300 branches, to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn, stipulated by the EU as punishment for the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The bank admitted in August that there was no longer any prospect of spinning this business out onto the stock market and is looking for a trade buyer. However, the obvious bidder, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander, is said to have pulled out. \u25a0 A much-delayed report into the treatment of small business customers.

      "bodyText": "Eight years ago, the US economy went to hell. Lehman Brothers bank collapsed, the first of many. As a financial crisis swept the globe, unemployment soared, house prices and stock markets collapsed. Today, stock markets are at record highs, house prices have bounced back, the unemployment rate is 5%, half its peak during the recession. And yet ... Earlier this month we told the stories of five people who lived through the recession, many of whom said the recovery feels hollow. Below readers who responded to the story share their experiences and how it will impact their vote. Craig from Jacksonville, Florida Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am about the same. In 2008 I was just two years out from finishing my undergraduate degree. I had the option to graduate early but when things began to turn dark, every intelligent person I knew told me to hold off. I remained in school for another year thinking I could wait it out. Boy, was I wrong. I ended up going to graduate school hoping to wait out the storm again. Turns out, that didn\u2019t help much either. After graduating as a highly skilled student, finding full-time employment was about as easy as finding affordable living in Manhattan. Since then, I worked just about everywhere. I have done consultant research, bussed tables, worked in an emergency room and even spent a year working at a Florida beach bar all while applying for applicable jobs in my field that came with benefits. I finally have a job, but the amount of debt I have acquired and the amount of job insecurity I still feel has me on edge about as bad as 2008. Who will you vote for? I am absolutely terrified of what is to come November 8. I am still a Florida registered voter so maybe my vote counts (if it does not end up on a beach somewhere). I plan to close my eyes and vote for Clinton. My biggest fear is that an economic bubble worse than 2008 is coming and that I will go back to bussing tables and serving drinks again. Lori from Denver, Colorado Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. In 2008, I just started working after an awful divorce. My ex-husband was a homebuilder and laid off in the crash and there went my maintenance and child support. Today, I\u2019m an executive assistant for a CEO. I\u2019m better off because my first job after being a stay-at-home mom for 13 years paid $50,000 and I was thrilled. In 2016, I\u2019m now at $75,000 so I\u2019ve taken some job risks but it\u2019s paid off. But everything else \u2013 my cost of living \u2013 seems to have absolutely skyrocketed. I literally live paycheck to paycheck. I have two kids in college and I pay their auto, health insurance and cellphones. It\u2019s crazy and I\u2019m a tad frightened for the world they\u2019ll enter soon. Not sure they\u2019ll ever be able to buy a home, at least here in Colorado. Who will you be voting for? I literally despise the Clintons so I can\u2019t vote for HRC. I always wanted to vote for the first woman, too. They\u2019re too sleazy for me. Trump scares the shit out of me. I was leaning toward him in the beginning because I do think a business person might bring a fresh perspective but, Jesus, not now. I think I\u2019ll write in Bernie\u2019s name. I don\u2019t know what else to do. Kurt Johnson from Woodstock, Georgia Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. The economy was in a total nosedive. Obama wasted no time approving large measures to stop the bleeding. I work in real estate investing. Real estate where I live has returned to 2007 prices and as a result, we have enjoyed a good ride of appreciation of homes we have bought over the last eight years. Who will you be voting for? I can\u2019t vote for the current Republican candidate under any circumstances. He is not fit to be a CEO, much less a president. I would be fine with things staying as they are so Hillary doesn\u2019t concern me that much. The Senate and House will keep her from making any changes for better or worse so I can stomach another four years until a respectable Republican runs in 2020. Willard from San Jose, California Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. The economy is in far better condition. Housing has recovered. Who will you be voting for? The economy will play a role with how I\u2019ll vote. Both parties make big promises which I don\u2019t expect to be fulfilled. But at least Trump does discuss trade, jobs and manufacturing. If Congress agreed with a fraction of his bluster it might improve the economy. But I\u2019ll NOT be voting for HRC because she is corrosive, divisive and corrupt to the core. On account of her, and with the current administration\u2019s help our trust in the Department of Justice has been destroyed. I\u2019ll be voting Trump. Eric from Framingham, Massachusetts Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. I have not had a steady income since I left teaching in 2012. I lost my home to Wells Fargo and now live with a friend. I don\u2019t have health insurance. I have a master\u2019s degree in education, a BA, speak three languages, and I am a veteran with combat experience, yet don\u2019t have a full-time job or meaningful part-time work. I don\u2019t make more than $15,000 a year. It\u2019s unlikely that at 53 I will ever work full-time again. So what, another 20-plus years of this meaningless existence? When people do that horrible \u201cthank you for your service\u201d [thing], I want to scream and tell them that serving my country as a soldier and my community as a teacher were the worst mistakes of my life. I should have gone into business, gone for my self and not the greater good, and been selfish and greedy instead. Left behind, no. Forgotten. Who will you be voting for? Not voting, don\u2019t care. Leslie from Wilmington, North Carolina Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. Why? I had to close the company. I went from earning $70,000 a year to now working two jobs, one full time for $37,000 a year and one part time (evenings and weekends) to bring my salary to $41,000. My health insurance costs have skyrocketed. Food is more expensive. I have a home that I cannot sell as I am still underwater. I had to use all my savings to help pay for my daughter\u2019s education so she is not lumbered with loans when she graduates. Who will you be voting for? I hate them both. I do feel that if Clinton is elected it will be the same, no change in the housing market, no change in income, no change in healthcare costs \u2013 just more of the same. It is appalling and tragic that we have two awful people to choose from. It just shows the level of corruption and dysfunction in this country. Jacob Lutz from Portland, Oregon Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am about the same. Why? In 2008, I was a student and a cashier at Kmart. I was transitioning from foster care to adulthood while balancing a part-time job with my first and last attempt at higher education. I was overwhelmed with the responsibility of college and surviving on $6.75 an hour but managed to survive thanks to my home state\u2019s support system for foster children and lack of financial burden. Today, I am a motorcycle technician and make around $30,000 a year and owe $20,000 in student loans. I also pay $200 a month for health insurance and bills on top of barely supporting myself. The stress is still the same but I\u2019ve gotten better at handling it. Lowering my hopes and expectations significantly has helped too. Who will you be voting for? I had more faith in Bernie than Hillary regarding the economy but since he\u2019s not an option, I\u2019m with her. I still believe Hillary knows how to listen to what people are wanting and has the clout in Washington to get more done. Peter Berry from Seattle, Washington Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. I no longer have a good, well-paying job and benefits. I was forced by circumstances to use up a good portion of my retirement savings to relocate and survive. I also used a lot of my savings to pay off my son\u2019s college law school loans as he has been unable to find even an entry-level job in the law profession. I had a successful, lifelong, professional career that disappeared overnight, and was unable to find comparable work because of my age and the terrible state of the economy. I think my efforts to navigate my way through the economic downturn likely mirror those of so many others. It isn\u2019t just the loss of decent paying jobs that has been an issue. It\u2019s also the erosion of savings meant for retirement. Also the enormous debts that have been run up for financial bailouts and the \u201ccheap money\u201d used to inflate the stock market will have to be faced eventually. I believe the entire political establishment has been complicit in what has happened. I worked on Obama\u2019s first election campaign and contributed quite a bit of my own money believing the \u201chope and change\u201d message. I felt optimistic that it was a possibility. Now I just feel used and betrayed. Who will you be voting for? I will be voting for Jill Stein because she represents the only real choice that exists. The Democrats and Republicans are the same in virtually every meaningful respect and do not represent the interests of the average person at all. The definition of a wasted vote is voting for either of them.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A landmark trade deal between the European Union and Canada is in meltdown, after Canada\u2019s trade minister walked out of talks with the Belgian regional parliament that has been blocking the deal. The Canadian trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, was on the verge of tears on Friday as she announced the \u201cend and the failure\u201d of talks with the Walloon government. However the head of the European parliament said late on Friday he would hold emergency talks in a bid to save the deal. Leaving the \u00c9lysette, the home of the Walloon government in Namur, Freeland said: \u201cIt seems obvious that the EU is now not capable of having an international agreement, even with a country that shares European values such as Canada, even with a country that is so kind and patient. \u201cCanada is disappointed. I am personally very disappointed. I have worked very very hard. We have decided to go home. I am truly very, very sad.\u201d The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta), which would eliminate tariffs on most goods between the EU and Canada, has been seven years in the making. But it has stumbled near the finish line as the Belgian region of Wallonia, with a population of 3.5 million, blocked Belgium\u2019s government from signing the deal. The EU, a single market of 510 million people, requires unanimity on trade deals. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said he would meet Freeland early on Saturday and Walloon premier Paul Magnette after that to revive the talks. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop at last mile,\u201d he said on Twitter. A spokesman for Freeland said he could not confirm the meeting would take place but said Freeland was still in Brussels as of Friday night. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner, insisted it was not the end of the road for Ceta. \u201cGood progress has been made in most areas of concerns for Wallonia in talks on Ceta. I sincerely believe this is not the end of the process,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. The commission had \u201cengaged wholeheartedly\u201d with Wallonia over the last days and it was \u201ctruly sad talks have been halted\u201d, she said. Wallonia continues to have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say may be used by multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders also suspect the local government in Namur of using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. The collapse of talks in Namur will be a heavy blow to EU leaders, who have warned that Europe\u2019s credibility is on the line. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was due to fly to Brussels on 27 October to sign the agreement. Some see the disintegrating Ceta deal as a bad omen for the UK, which wants to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the EU. \u201cIf we can\u2019t make it with Canada, I don\u2019t think we can make it with the UK,\u201d the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, quipped this week. British officials have played down similarities, arguing that putting up trade barriers will be a very different exercise to taking them down. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also dismissed talk of a parallel. \u201cThe issues that we have been discussing now in relation to Ceta is not something that brought to mind the discussions with Great Britain,\u201d she told reporters after an EU summit in Brussels. As recently as Thursday, EU officials hoped to get Wallonia on board, but the outlook had darkened by Friday morning, when the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, denounced the \u201cradicalisation of positions\u201d from Walloon negotiators. Belgium, a founding member of the EU that prides itself on its ability to find compromises, is likely to experience heightened tensions between its Flemish and Francophone regions. The scramble to rescue Ceta overshadowed a Brussels summit, where EU leaders failed to agree on reforming Europe\u2019s trade defences against a glut of cheap Chinese steel.
