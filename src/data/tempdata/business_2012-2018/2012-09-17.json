With polling day less than two months away, the sabre-rattling is designed to garner votes in a swing state. But there's more to it than that. A low-level trade war between the two economic superpowers has been long simmering, a function of Beijing's determination to industrialise rapidly, the hollowing out of America's manufacturing base and the sheer size of the US trade deficit. Neither country is exactly squeaky clean: for every Chinese subsidy to a car parts manufacturer there has been a US government contract to protect key sectors of the economy such as defence. In truth, China's use of subsidies has been less important than its manipulation of the exchange rate to ensure that exports to the US remain cheap. Keeping the yuan artificially low has been remarkably successful in getting tens of millions of Chinese people out of the fields and into the factories, but it has created real tensions with a US policy elite convinced that China is using unfair means to challenge American economic hegemony. So while Obama's gambit may pay off in the short run, the bigger issue of the dollar-yuan exchange rate will remain contentious long after a settlement has been agreed at the WTO and the US election is safely out of the way. It would make sense for China to be less reliant on exports, not least because the continuation of massive US trade deficits will eventually lead to a collapse of the dollar and a big reduction in the value of China's US assets.

The rod, which contains americium-241/beryllium and is stamped with a radiation warning symbol with the words \"Danger Radioactive: Do not handle. Notify civil authorities if found\", was lost during a 130-mile journey between oil well sites in Pecos and Odessa last Tuesday. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) warned that the radioactive materials \"could cause permanent injury to a person who handled them\". The agency said americium-241/beryllium, known as Am-241, is a \"category 3\" source of radiation and would normally have to be held for some hours before causing health problems. But the NRC still warned that \"it could possibly \u2013 although it is unlikely \u2013 be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period of days to weeks\". A spokeswoman for the NRC said there are no records of radioactive rods lost in the last five years. \"[There has] never been one lost in the public domain [in the last five years],\" she said. \"Someone wanting to blow this source up would have to find it first.\" The route the Halliburton truck took between Pecos and Odessa has been painstakingly searched with radioactive detection gear three times with assistance from local police and the National Guard. \"When the crew went to remove the Am-241 source they discovered the source transport container lock and plug were not in place and that the source was missing,\" the NRC said in its report into the incident. \"The crew returned to the well site near Pecos and searched for the source, but did not find it. The radiation safety officer stated that the lock was found in the storage compartment in the back of the truck. The transport container plug was not in the container.\" The three-man Halliburton crew, who had been using the rod to identify oil and gas deposits suitable for fracking, have been questioned by the FBI. The NRC said Halliburton was carrying out a forensic search of the truck. \"They are literally stripping it down, removing every piece of equipment looking for the source,\" the agency said. Halliburton said it would offer a reward to anyone who finds the rod, but cautioned the public to stay at least 25ft away from the device. \"The route between the two well sites continues to be combed using specialised equipment in extensive ground searches and aerial analysis,\" the company said. Halliburton, which was once run by former vice president Dick Cheney, has previously attracted controversy for its role in BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, building Guant\u00e1namo Bay and for working in Iraq, Iran and Libya.",

      "bodyText": "Amid all the noise from Barclays and others about changing the culture of banking \u2013 and the way staff are paid \u2013 there is one bank that has not handed out bonuses for 40 years. Instead Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank with bold ambitions for growth in the UK, has a profit-sharing system called the Oktogonen foundation, which only distributes the proceeds when the individual turns 60. It is one of the co-challenger banks that Vince Cable, the business secretary, wants to encourage lending to small businesses. Every employee from the most junior to the most senior gets the same allocation, which is based on whether the bank outperforms its rivals. There are no sales targets and budgets to meet. Around 90% of the scheme's proceeds are invested in the bank's shares, something that regulators have been keen to encourage. It sounds very egalitarian and at first glance seems like a neat solution to the bonus culture. But it not as simple as it seems. The Oktogonen scheme has run into trouble in the UK. For the past two years the 1,100 UK based staff, working out of 137 branches (a number likely to grow), have not received their allocation because of a change to the tax laws to deal with \"disguised remuneration\" (pay that was not getting taxed). Until two years ago HM Revenue and Customs had treated Oktogonen as an employer-funded retirement benefit scheme which meant tax was paid on receipt at age 60. But now as a result of the changes, staff are required to pay tax when their part of the pot is allocated and then when it is disbursed. In Sweden tax is paid upon receipt by the individual scheme members and the bank feels it is exposing its staff to double taxation, so no distributions have been made to UK staff for two years. Handelsbanken insists that the scheme was never about tax avoidance. The Treasury refers queries to HMRC, which refused to comment. In his book on Handelsbanken, Niels Kroner describes Oktogonen as embodying \"the bank's visceral dislike for risk-taking, its focus on concentrating on customer satisfaction over profits, and its emphasis on long-term orientation\". He adds: \"As the system has been in place for a very long time, there is simply no expectation of any special remuneration for doing the job well. Staff know that they will get a competitive salary and a very generous pension from the Oktogonen foundation once they retire.\" Handelsbanken's UK chief executive, Anders Bouvin, is frustrated. He sees Oktogonen as \"an integral part of our steering system\" and is looking at the options available. He does not reveal what they might be. How ironic it would be if bonuses ended up being the answer.",

      "body": "<p>Amid all the noise from Barclays and others about changing the culture of banking \u2013 and the way staff are paid \u2013 there is one bank that has not handed out bonuses for 40 years.</p> <p>Instead Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank with bold ambitions for growth in the UK, has a profit-sharing system called the Oktogonen foundation, which only distributes the proceeds when the individual turns 60. It is one of the co-challenger banks that Vince Cable, the business secretary, wants to encourage lending to small businesses.</p> <p>Every employee from the most junior to the most senior gets the same allocation, which is based on whether the bank outperforms its rivals. There are no sales targets and budgets to meet. Around 90% of the scheme's proceeds are invested in the bank's shares, something that regulators have been keen to encourage. It sounds very egalitarian and at first glance seems like a neat solution to the bonus culture.</p> <p>But it not as simple as it seems. The Oktogonen scheme has run into trouble in the UK. For the past two years the 1,100 UK based staff, working out of 137 branches (a number likely to grow), have not received their allocation because of a change to the tax laws to deal with <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/disguised_remuneration.pdf\" title=\"\">\"disguised remuneration\"</a> (pay that was not getting taxed). Until two years ago HM Revenue and Customs had treated Oktogonen as an employer-funded retirement benefit scheme which meant tax was paid on receipt at age 60.</p> <p>But now as a result of the changes, staff are required to pay tax when their part of the pot is allocated and then when it is disbursed.</p> <p>In Sweden tax is paid upon receipt by the individual scheme members and the bank feels it is exposing its staff to double taxation, so no distributions have been made to UK staff for two years.</p> <p>Handelsbanken insists that the scheme was never about tax avoidance. The Treasury refers queries to HMRC, which refused to comment.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.harriman-house.com/products/books/413762/professional/a-blueprint-for-better-banking\" title=\"\">book on Handelsbanken, Niels Kroner</a> describes Oktogonen as embodying \"the bank's visceral dislike for risk-taking, its focus on concentrating on customer satisfaction over profits, and its emphasis on long-term orientation\". He adds: \"As the system has been in place for a very long time, there is simply no expectation of any special remuneration for doing the job well. Staff know that they will get a competitive salary and a very generous pension from the Oktogonen foundation once they retire.\"</p> <p>Handelsbanken's UK chief executive, Anders Bouvin, is frustrated. He sees Oktogonen as \"an integral part of our steering system\" and is looking at the options available. He does not reveal what they might be. How ironic it would be if bonuses ended up being the answer.</p>",
