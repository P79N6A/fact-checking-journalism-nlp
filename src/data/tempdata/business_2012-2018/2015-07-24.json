      "bodyText": "British businesses are giving too much money to shareholders and not investing enough, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane has said. He warned that firms were \u201ceating themselves\u201d by favouring shareholder dividend payouts over investing their profits. That tendency, Haldane said, was to blame for \u201csubpar\u201d growth in some economies, including Britain\u2019s, in recent decades. He also reiterated his opposition to raising interest rates in the near future, maintaining the distance that has opened up between him and the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney on the issue. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme on Friday, Haldane said that there was \u201cno rush\u201d to push up rates because economy was \u201cstill healing\u201d. \u201cThere are still people without a job who would like a job; there are still people with jobs who would like to work more hours. And, even for those that have got jobs, their pay \u2013 in most cases \u2013 isn\u2019t racing away,\u201d he said. And he said there were economic risks across the world that could still hit Britain. \u201cFor me, the combination of a still-healing economy, very low price pressures and a wobbly world means that there is no rush to move rates from where they are right now.\u201d Haldane said that, besides pushing lower than expected growth, company laws in the US, UK and other countries that place the shareholder \u201cfront and centre\u201d were partly to blame for triggering the financial crisis. \u201cIn many cases, it was the result of banks seeking high return to remit to shareholders. How did they do that? By borrowing too much and therein the seeds of the crisis were sown.\u201d He said that the law puts the \u201cshort-term interests of shareholders in a position of primacy when it comes to running the firm\u201d. \u201cThere are other models of corporate governance round the world, which share the spoils somewhat more equally between a wider set of not just shareholders, but stakeholders in a firm. Who are those stakeholders? That includes its employees, that includes its customers and its clients,\u201d Haldane said. \u201cThe public limited company model has served the world well from a growth perspective. But you can always have too much of a good thing. \u201cThe nature of shareholding today is fundamentally different than what it was a generation ago. The average share was held by the average shareholder for around six years. Today, that average share is held by the average shareholder for less than six months.\u201d Asked whether it was the Bank\u2019s place to seek to affect statute, he said: \u201cUltimately, if we can change the structure of the system \u2013 the structure and incentives within banks and non-banks, that has got to be better for everyone.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Salads have rarely been so expensively dressed after a combination of drought and disease pushed the price of olive oil up 10% so far this year, amid warnings from suppliers that harvests are the worst they have seen. The Italian government has declared a \u201cstate of calamity\u201d in the provinces of Lecce and Brindisi on the heel of the country, where olive groves are being attacked by a bacterial disease nicknamed \u201colive ebola\u201d . Up to 1m centuries-old olive trees could be felled in one of the most picturesque tourist spots of Italy in an attempt to contain the problem. The cost of the raw material has been increasing for two years as crops have been hit by drought in Spain, the world\u2019s biggest producer of the oil, and the bacterial disease Xylella fastidiosa, which is destroying trees in Italy. Analysts are expecting prices to remain high in coming months as demand is increasing. Retailers and distributors wanted to buy 12% more olive oil than exporters were able to deliver last month, according to industry insiders. Buyers in Latin America have turned to Europe in the wake of poor harvests over the Atlantic, while eastern Europeans have also been using increasing amounts of olive oil. The next harvest from southern Europe is not expected until September, but fears of a third poor harvest in a row in Spain and Italy continue to push up wholesale prices of remaining stocks over the summer. The other two large olive oil producers, Greece and Tunisia, had good yield and production, but not enough to compensate for Spain and Italy. In the UK, heavy price competition between retailers, led by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, has helped keep prices relatively low for shoppers. But this year, retailers and processors have been forced to pass on increases as the cost of the raw material from Italy has hit a 10-year high. The average retail price of a litre of extra virgin olive oil has risen from \u00a36.32 in December to \u00a36.95 this month, according to data from trade journal the Grocer. One olive oil supplier told the Guardian: \u201cRetailers and suppliers hold a lot of stock and contracts are signed for six months or a year, so volatility in the market can take a while to feed through to supermarket shelves. Retailers absorbed price rises earlier in the year because they were pegged by discounters but there has been absolutely no letup and we\u2019re now in a crisis situation. \u201cUntil this year I would have said this was just the vagaries of the olive oil market. But nobody has seen it this bad. I don\u2019t know that I would go as far as to blame global warming but clearly three years of bad harvest would be almost unknown.\u201d The EU\u2019s health and food safety commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, visiting southern Italy this week amid concern about the disease, which is also a threat to citrus and grape crops, said it was an emergency situation: \u201cEvery day matters. Because every day is a day in which we are putting the healthy olive trees of Puglia at risk.\u201d The EU has warned that there would be serious consequences for supply chains if the disease spreads. Olive harvests work on a cycle in which trees generally produce a strong harvest one year and then weaker results the following year as the trees take a bit of rest. Last year should have been a strong season in Spain, but fierce hot and dry weather meant yields were lower than hoped for. This year again, the country suffered from a dry and fiercely hot spring, when the olives flower, raising fears of another poor crop. Lourdes Negrillo, from Vallejo, a producer from the Ja\u00e9n province in southern Spain, said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t rain as much as it should\u2019ve done in the spring and that doesn\u2019t help with the feeling about this next crop. I think that the new crop won\u2019t be as bad as last year but probably the olives will be smaller and have less quantities of oil. If it rains in September and October then we will get a bit more. It will be a different picture.\u201d Vito Martielli, an analyst at Rabobank, said good weather conditions during the next few months would be crucial for Spain: \u201cIn the coming months, prices are expected to be sustained and in particular the premium extranvirgin olive oil which is experiencing even stronger price increase in Italy.\u201d",

The average retail price of a litre of extra virgin olive oil has risen from \u00a36.32 in December to \u00a36.95 this month, according to data from <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/\">trade journal the Grocer</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/extra_virgin_olive_oil-zip/giv-30080H0LLstW08Swa\" data-alt=\"Graph showing the average retail price of extra virgin olive oil in the UK\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/extra_virgin_olive_oil-zip/giv-30080H0LLstW08Swa\">Graph showing the average retail price of extra virgin olive oil in the UK</a> </figure>  <p>One olive oil supplier told the Guardian: \u201cRetailers and suppliers hold a lot of stock and contracts are signed for six months or a year, so volatility in the market can take a while to feed through to supermarket shelves. Retailers absorbed price rises earlier in the year because they were pegged by discounters but there has been absolutely no letup and we\u2019re now in a crisis situation.</p> <p>\u201cUntil this year I would have said this was just the vagaries of the olive oil market. But nobody has seen it this bad. I don\u2019t know that I would go as far as to blame global warming but clearly three years of bad harvest would be almost unknown.\u201d</p> <p>The EU\u2019s health and food safety commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, visiting southern Italy this week amid concern about the disease, which is also a threat to citrus and grape crops, said it was an emergency situation: \u201cEvery day matters. Because every day is a day in which we are putting the healthy olive trees of Puglia at risk.\u201d The EU has warned that there would be serious consequences for supply chains if the disease spreads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdd86aeff4d5069772401082efcc771d7f744196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd86aeff4d5069772401082efcc771d7f744196/0_79_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red crosses painted on olive trees that need to be cut down to contain \u2018olive ebola\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red crosses painted on olive trees that need to be cut down to contain an outbreak of \u2018olive ebola\u2019 in Puglia, southern Italy. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Frigione/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olive harvests work on a cycle in which trees generally produce a strong harvest one year and then weaker results the following year as the trees take a bit of rest. Last year should have been a strong season in Spain, but fierce hot and dry weather meant yields were lower than hoped for. This year again, the country suffered from a dry and fiercely hot spring, when the olives flower, raising fears of another poor crop.</p> <p>Lourdes Negrillo, from Vallejo, a producer from the Ja\u00e9n province in southern Spain, said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t rain as much as it should\u2019ve done in the spring and that doesn\u2019t help with the feeling about this next crop. I think that the new crop won\u2019t be as bad as last year but probably the olives will be smaller and have less quantities of oil. If it rains in September and October then we will get a bit more. It will be a different picture.\u201d</p> <p>Vito Martielli, an analyst at Rabobank, said good weather conditions during the next few months would be crucial for Spain: \u201cIn the coming months, prices are expected to be sustained and in particular the premium extranvirgin olive oil which is experiencing even stronger price increase in Italy.\u201d </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The party is over in the mining industry \u2013 again. There is a strong whiff of 2009, the year after the great financial crisis. Almost every commodity is falling in price. Assumptions for demand, investment, jobs and shareholders\u2019 dividends are being ripped up. The share price of once-mighty Anglo American illustrates the industry\u2019s feast-or-famine characteristics. Between 2003 and 2009, Anglo\u2019s shares travelled from 900p to \u00a333 and then back to 900p; after 2009, they rose again to \u00a333 but are now 778p. How does that happen? Look at the group\u2019s Minas-Rio operation in Brazil for the tale in miniature. This project was conceived in 2007 when the price of iron ore was $150 a tonne. Anglo spent $8.4bn, instead of a planned $2.9bn, on building the mine plus infrastructure that included a 325-mile pipeline. Throw in acquisition costs and Anglo owned an asset with a notional value of $14bn. Three write-downs later, and with iron ore fetching closer to $50 a tonne, Minas-Rio is now valued by Anglo at just $3.6bn. Part of that financial pain was self-inflicted. The deeper malaise affecting the entire industry is weaker demand from China, the biggest consumer of raw materials. A country with 20% of the world\u2019s population takes about 45% of global copper production; and Chinese steelmakers buy almost 60% of exported iron ore, mostly from Brazil and Australia. When China slows, upsets happen. Back in 2009, the miners were saved when Beijing, fearing recession after the banking crisis in the west, launched a massive infrastructure programme, boosting spending on roads, railways and houses. The commodity party was back on. Rio Tinto, which repaired its balance sheet with a $15bn emergency rights issue at \u00a314 a share in 2009, was trading at \u00a345 within two years. Now Rio is back at \u00a324. This time the miners will not receive a get-out-of-jail card from China. First, Beijing knows that huge infrastructure spending, as a proportion of GDP, is unsustainable. The authorities are trying to encourage consumption by consumers instead. Second, China, overburdened with debt, can\u2019t afford a repeat anyway. The other difference from 2009 is more encouraging for the producers. Balance sheets are stronger and most mining chief executives, instead of placing blind faith in a \u201cstronger for longer\u201d commodities supercycle, have been talking the language of production efficiency and investment discipline. Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of BHP Billiton, said in February that the world\u2019s biggest miner started planning for a sustained period of lower prices almost three years earlier. Since then, he said, $10bn a year had been saved by productivity gains and capital spending had been cut by 40%. Are such cuts enough to protect profit margins and dividends? Already, mining chiefs are blaming each other for over-investing and over-producing. \u201cWe are responding to the market and making the changes, unlike some who talk about it but do not do that much,\u201d said Mark Cutifani, Anglo\u2019s chief executive, on Friday. He may have been referring to the Brazilian group Vale. At Glencore, industry titan Ivan Glasenberg has been waging a verbal war against rivals for 18 months. \u201cI\u2019m doing my level best to convince our competitors that we should understand the words supply-demand,\u201d the chief executive told a frustrated shareholder at the group\u2019s annual meeting in May. The frustration will be deeper now. Glencore floated in London at 530p in 2011 and it\u2019s been downhill all the way; its shares hit a new low of 210p on Friday. The company is still worth \u00a330bn, or $47bn, but a half-promised share buyback may have to be abandoned. Glencore\u2019s net debt is $51bn, analysts estimate, if one excludes the value of commodities held for sale by the trading division.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two London-listed mining groups are to slash up to 12,000 jobs as commodity prices slump to levels last seen during the global recession of 2008-09. Platinum producer Lonmin plans to shut or mothball several mine shafts, putting 6,000 South African jobs at risk. Platinum prices have hit a six-and-a-half-year low, while power and labour costs in South Africa have increased sharply. Anglo American is also cutting 6,000 jobs and stepping up a cost-cutting programme, after slumping to a first-half loss due to the rout in metal prices. Rising worries about oversupply, coupled with demand tailing off in China \u2013 the largest commodities consumer, have battered metals prices over the past week. Platinum has fallen to less than $1,000 (\u00a3645) an ounce \u2013 having been nearly $2,000 in 2011 \u2013 while copper has reached 2009 lows. Gold hit fresh five-and-a-half-year lows of $1,077.00 on Friday, extending sharp losses from the start of the week when investors dumped the precious metal on expectations that US interest rates will soon rise. Gold has long been viewed as a safe investment during times of uncertainty, but when interest rates rise investors typically switch out of non-yielding gold into other assets that pay interest or a dividend. Mark Cutifani, Anglo\u2019s chief executive, said the FTSE 100 company has been cutting platinum, diamond and coal production. He said the market for iron ore, the main ingredient in steel, is clearly oversupplied, with industrial production in China slowing. \u201cIt is a tough market, prices are falling away, but we expect to show progress by the end of the year. It will probably get tougher in the second half, but we will get through it,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV. Lonmin shares slumped 17% to a record low of 62.4p, while Anglo American shares lost 3.5% to 778p, the lowest for almost 13 years. Much of the pressure on commodities has stemmed from signs of a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Fears of waning Chinese demand were raised on Friday by figures showing activity across its factories declined in July at the fastest pace for more than a year . The flash Caixin/Markit China Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index dropped to 48.2 in July. It marked the fifth month in a row that activity has been below the 50-point mark that divides contraction from expansion. At the same time, supply of many commodities, particularly industrial metals and oil, has picked up, further knocking prices. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at spreadbetter IG Group, also pointed to expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as September. \u201cThe issue of falling commodities has replaced Greece and Chinese equity volatility as the centrepiece of the capital markets. This seems to be premised on a toxic mix of increasing future surplus figures, but Chinese growth and concern of a September move from the Federal Reserve are also in play,\u201d he said. Despite the recent sharp price moves, not all analysts believe the outlook is gloomy for commodities. Consultancy Capital Economics said it disagreed with those \u201cscrambling to predict a further collapse\u201d. \u201cOur view is that the pendulum has already swung too far towards pessimism, particularly over the prospects for ... demand. Indeed, in many cases the recent falls in prices may actually help to accelerate the responses \u2013 both in demand and supply \u2013 that are necessary for a sustained recovery in 2016 and beyond,\u201d said its head of commodities research, Julian Jessop. Mining firm Lonmin pointed to depressed platinum prices as it revealed its planned closures could affect up to 6,000 employees, including contractors. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) described Lonmin\u2019s planned job cuts as a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. \u201cIt is a tragedy for the mineworkers in South Africa. As the NUM, we are going to fight against any job losses,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis drastic action by Lonmin will leave thousands of mineworkers in a dire situation. The high number of retrenchments will contribute to high unemployment rate in South Africa.\u201d The unemployment rate in South Africa is more than 25% and there have been bloody clashes with Lonmin workers. Anglo also blamed the \u201ccommodity price rout\u201d as it reported a loss of $1.9bn (\u00a31.2bn) for the six months to June, against a profit of $2.9bn a year earlier, partly reflecting asset writedowns. The first of the big global miners to report results for the six months to June, Anglo is looking to slash 6,000 \u201coverhead and other indirect roles\u201d out of a total workforce of 151,200 worldwide, a 35% reduction. It is also cutting back at its London office. The group has been selling off assets in its battle to restore profitability and intends to reduce the number of assets from 55 to 40.",

      "bodyText": "In the early days of the Greek debt crisis, two German politicians came up with a radical solution: Greece should sell off some of its uninhabited islands and property to pay back its creditors. \u201cSell your islands you bankrupt Greeks! And sell the Acropolis too!\u201d was how the German tabloid Bild summed up their idea. While selling off ancient monuments was never a serious idea, the privatisation of state assets has always been an integral feature of Greece\u2019s international bailouts. Over the past five years, Greece has faltered on promises to sell vital parts of its infrastructure \u2013 ports, airports, marinas and waterworks \u2013 in exchange for billions of euros in loans. Privatisation remains a vital element of Greece\u2019s latest bailout deal. Under threat of being forced out of the eurozone, Athens agreed to transfer \u201cvaluable assets\u201d to an independent fund, with the aim of raising \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn). Half the proceeds will be used to shore up capital reserves at Greek banks; a quarter will be used to repay Greece\u2019s creditors, and the remainder will be spent on unspecified investments. The privatisation fund was the issue that almost forced a Grexit at the marathon 17-hour, all-night summit of European leaders in Brussels earlier this month. \u201cIt was the only thing discussed at the summit,\u201d recalls one diplomat. At 6am, as Greece teetered on the brink of leaving the euro, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still haggling over privatisation details with his counterparts, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The idea of the privatisation fund first emerged in a leaked German government paper which argued Greece should leave the eurozone if it did not agree to put \u20ac50bn in a Luxembourg fund as collateral for its debts. Although drafted in Berlin, the plan soon found support among Greece\u2019s hardline creditors in central Europe and the Baltics. Tsipras wrung two concessions: the fund would be run from Athens, not Luxembourg, and a tranche of the cash would be earmarked for investments in Greece. The privatisation fund is likely to remain one of the most contentious issues as Greece and its creditors strive to conclude bailout talks by mid-August. From the creditors\u2019 perspective, Greek privatisation has been failure heaped upon failure. In 2011, international creditors decreed that Athens would raise \u20ac50bn by the end of 2015 from selling state assets. By early 2015, only \u20ac3.2bn had been raised; none of the most sensitive aspects \u2013 airports, ports, railways \u2013 had been sold. Neither officials at the European commission nor the International Monetary Fund are taking the \u20ac50bn target remotely seriously. In a devastating analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden published in July, the IMF said it was realistic to assume asset sales would be worth no more than \u20ac500m a year \u2013 meaning it could take 100 years to raise \u20ac50bn. Gabriel Sterne at Oxford Economics argues that the IMF has failed to learn from its recent history that \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to setting numerical targets. \u201cIt is economics versus faith \u2013 \u2018Somehow we will make this work even if it doesn\u2019t add up\u2019 \u2013 but the economics really doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d When Syriza swept to power in January, one of its first actions was to sack the people in charge of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency and cancel plans to sell Greece\u2019s electricity transmission operator (ADMIE). The sale of other assets \u2013 most notably regional airports and the port of Piraeus \u2013 had almost been completed, but was thrown into doubt. The government is expected to put up little resistance to the sales now being concluded. Venues purpose-built for the 2004 Athens Olympic games, which have sat derelict and rotting for the past decade, will also be among the assets moved to the fund, alongside state utilities, including the water board and ADMIE. Both Russia and China have expressed interest in snapping up the state-run railway network, one of the biggest encumbrances on public finances before the debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The Greek state is also rich in buildings bequeathed by individuals to municipalities and the Orthodox Church \u2013 properties that are also expected to be included in the fund. Contrary to popular perception, the public sector owns very few islands. The sale last week to Hollywood star Johnny Depp of the Aegean islet of Stroggilo, for a reputed \u20ac4.2m, was conducted privately. While Tsipras has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over the sale of state assets, he has repeatedly branded the entire bailout plan as a bad deal that he doesn\u2019t believe in. Unions with ties to the governing party have already vowed to \u201cwage war\u201d to stop the sale of docks in Piraeus, where the Chinese conglomerate, Cosco, currently manages three piers. With the debt-stricken country on its knees, officials have stressed that the prime minister will fight to ensure the denationalisations are not seen as a fire sale. However, independent observers fear just that. \u201cPrivatisation in Greece right now means a fire sale,\u201d political economist Jens Bastian said. Bastian was one of the officials responsible for privatisation under the European commission\u2019s Taskforce for Greece, a body of experts distinct from the troika. He thinks it was a \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d to set a target to raise \u20ac50bn from asset sales, in the absence of support from Greek politicians across the political spectrum, from the centre-right New Democracy party, to Pasok on the centre-left and Syriza on the left. \u201cWe have never had a political majority to embrace the idea of privatisation. How are you going to create the political momentum that has been absent in the past years under more difficult conditions today?\u201d he asks. Greece\u2019s creditors share such scepticism. Their answer is tighter controls. The privatisation fund will be managed by Greeks under the close watch of creditors. The privatisation fund has few precedents, although it has been compared to the Treuhandanstalt, the German agency created in the dying days of the GDR to privatise East German assets shortly before reunification. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was one of the first to draw the parallel, although others offer the comparison unprompted. Peter Doyle, a former IMF economist, says the Treuhand offers the closest parallels: the agency had full control over government ministries to sell assets quickly. \u201cThe principal task was to sell these things to somebody for cash.\u201d Greek government officials and opposition politicians said it was too early to know how the Greek fund would operate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before we have a clear picture of what this fund and the privatisation scheme will entail,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. \u201cBut the entire privatisation process will feature large in negotiations because Tsipras is so opposed to them and creditors see them as a good way to raise revenues.\u201d Greece has an urgent need for cash: although the eurozone bailout is meant to be worth up to \u20ac86bn, only \u20ac50bn is on the table, via the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Doyle thinks Greece\u2019s bailout is underfunded. \u201cThe Europeans just don\u2019t have enough cash ... and a major way to fill that gap is through privatisation.\u201d Officials at the Greek privatisation agency are \u201cgoing to find their arms very strongly twisted to provide needed cash\u201d, he says. \u201cThe privatisation agency is facing a trade off between doing something that is fair and open and following judicial procedures, or something that is going to deliver needed cash.\u201d He fears Greece could be heading down the path taken by Russia in the 1990s, when valuable state assets were sold at knockdown prices to raise urgently-needed cash, creating a new oligarch class in the process. \u201cThe very thing we all think that Greece needs \u2013 to get rid of its oligarchy \u2013 will in fact be entrenched by privatisation done this way,\u201d argues Doyle, who worked on privatisations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in the 1990s. The difference between those countries and Greece, he thinks, is that the population and political class in central Europe accepted the idea of privatisation, despite the short-term hardships. He is convinced the current privatisation plan for Greece is doomed to fail. \u201cThe programme was set up to encourage Greece to leave the euro and that plan didn\u2019t work, so now we are stuck with the privatisation arrangement that nobody, not even the original creditors, ever intended to happen.\u201d Up for sale Helliniko Olympic complex Ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki 14 regional airports PPC power company, including ADMIE, the electricity transmission operator DEPA natural gas company Hellenic Petroleum Hellenic Post Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company Xenia Hotels in Rhodes Marinas of Chios, Pylos and other locations Source: Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund",

Neither officials at the European commission nor the International Monetary Fund are taking the \u20ac50bn target remotely seriously.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/jul/15/the-imf-position-on-greece-explained\">devastating analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden</a> published in July, the IMF said it was realistic to assume asset sales would be worth no more than \u20ac500m a year \u2013 meaning it could take 100 years to raise \u20ac50bn.</p> <p>Gabriel Sterne at Oxford Economics argues that the IMF has failed to learn from its recent history that \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to setting numerical targets. \u201cIt is economics versus faith \u2013 \u2018Somehow we will make this work even if it doesn\u2019t add up\u2019 \u2013 but the economics really doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d</p> <p>When Syriza swept to power in January, one of its first actions was to sack the people in charge of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency and cancel plans to sell Greece\u2019s electricity transmission operator (ADMIE). The sale of other assets \u2013 most notably regional airports and the port of Piraeus \u2013 had almost been completed, but was thrown into doubt. The government is expected to put up little resistance to the sales now being concluded. Venues purpose-built for the 2004 Athens Olympic games, which have sat derelict and rotting for the past decade, will also be among the assets moved to the fund, alongside state utilities, including the water board and ADMIE. <br></p> <p>Both Russia and China have expressed interest in snapping up the state-run railway network, one of the biggest encumbrances on public finances before the debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The Greek state is also rich in buildings bequeathed by individuals to municipalities and the Orthodox Church \u2013 properties that are also expected to be included in the fund. Contrary to popular perception, the public sector owns very few islands. The sale last week to Hollywood star Johnny Depp of the Aegean islet of Stroggilo, for a reputed \u20ac4.2m, was conducted privately.</p> <p>While Tsipras has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over the sale of state assets, he has repeatedly branded the entire bailout plan as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/alexis-tsipras-bailout-greece-debt-crisis\">a bad deal that he doesn\u2019t believe in</a>.<br></p> <p>Unions with ties to the governing party have already vowed to \u201cwage war\u201d to stop the sale of docks in Piraeus, where the Chinese conglomerate, Cosco, currently manages three piers. With the debt-stricken country on its knees, officials have stressed that the prime minister will fight to ensure the denationalisations are not seen as a fire sale.<br></p> <p>However, independent observers fear just that. \u201cPrivatisation in Greece right now means a fire sale,\u201d political economist Jens Bastian said.<br></p> <p>Bastian was one of the officials responsible for privatisation under the European commission\u2019s Taskforce for Greece, a body of experts distinct from the troika. He thinks it was a \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d to set a target to raise \u20ac50bn from asset sales, in the absence of support from Greek politicians across the political spectrum, from the centre-right New Democracy party, to Pasok on the centre-left and Syriza on the left.</p> <p>\u201cWe have never had a political majority to embrace the idea of privatisation. How are you going to create the political momentum that has been absent in the past years under more difficult conditions today?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s creditors share such scepticism. Their answer is tighter controls. The privatisation fund will be managed by Greeks under the close watch of creditors. </p> <p>The privatisation fund has few precedents, although it has been compared to the <em>Treuhandanstalt</em>, the German agency created in the dying days of the GDR to privatise East German assets shortly before reunification. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was one of the first <a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/21/europes-vindictive-privatization-plan-for-greece-project-syndicate/\">to draw the parallel</a>, although others offer the comparison unprompted. Peter Doyle, a former IMF economist, says the <em>Treuhand</em> offers the closest parallels: the agency had full control over government ministries to sell assets quickly. \u201cThe principal task was to sell these things to somebody for cash.\u201d</p> <p> Greek government officials and opposition politicians said it was too early to know how the Greek fund would operate. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before we have a clear picture of what this fund and the privatisation scheme will entail,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. \u201cBut the entire privatisation process will feature large in negotiations because Tsipras is so opposed to them and creditors see them as a good way to raise revenues.\u201d </p> <p>Greece has an urgent need for cash: although the eurozone bailout is meant to be worth up to \u20ac86bn, only \u20ac50bn is on the table, via the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. <br></p> <p>Doyle thinks Greece\u2019s bailout is underfunded. \u201cThe Europeans just don\u2019t have enough cash ... and a major way to fill that gap is through privatisation.\u201d Officials at the Greek privatisation agency are \u201cgoing to find their arms very strongly twisted to provide needed cash\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe privatisation agency is facing a trade off between doing something that is fair and open and following judicial procedures, or something that is going to deliver needed cash.\u201d<br></p> <p>He fears Greece could be heading down the path taken by Russia in the 1990s, when valuable state assets were sold at knockdown prices to raise urgently-needed cash, creating a new oligarch class in the process.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe very thing we all think that Greece needs \u2013 to get rid of its oligarchy \u2013 will in fact be entrenched by privatisation done this way,\u201d argues Doyle, who worked on privatisations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in the 1990s. The difference between those countries and Greece, he thinks, is that the population and political class in central Europe accepted the idea of privatisation, despite the short-term hardships.</p> <p>He is convinced the current privatisation plan for Greece is doomed to fail. \u201cThe programme was set up to encourage Greece to leave the euro and that plan didn\u2019t work, so now we are stuck with the privatisation arrangement that nobody, not even the original creditors, ever intended to happen.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Up for sale</strong></h2> <ul> <li>Helliniko Olympic complex<br></li> <li>Ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki <br></li> <li>14 regional airports<br></li> <li>PPC power company, including ADMIE, the electricity transmission operator<br></li> <li>DEPA natural gas company<br></li> <li>Hellenic Petroleum</li> <li>Hellenic Post</li> <li>Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company</li> <li>Xenia Hotels in Rhodes</li> <li>Marinas of Chios, Pylos and other locations</li> </ul> <p><em>Source: Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "PS: Hot off the press, we take a look at that plan to raise \u20ac50bn in Greek asset sales.... So, with the Greek bailout talks delayed until at least Monday, we may be done for the day. I\u2019ll pop back if anything important happens (but it seems unlikely right now....) Have great weekends all. GW All the main European stock markets lost ground today. The French and German markets weakened after this morning\u2019s PMI surveys showed private sector growth slowing. Elsewhere, the drop in Chinese factory output reported overnight hit sentiment: Mining stocks suffered another bad day in London, helping to wipe another 1.1% off the FTSE 100. The steady fall in the prices of iron ore, platinum, zinc, copper, tin, gold (and pretty much every other commodity you can think of) had a predictable effect on the companies who dig the stuff up: Greece has been given a big Fat French tick on its first report card since the July 12 European Summit where prime minister Alexis Tsipras made his spectacular u-turn and accepted lenders\u2019 demands. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports The Greek leader\u2019s office has released a statement saying Tsipras was applauded by French president Francois Hollande when the two men spoke by phone this afternoon. It says: \u201cThe French president congratulated Alexis Tsipras for the faithful implementation of what was agreed in so far as prior actions are concerned in the written text of the summit meeting of euro zone member states And both confirmed the importance to keep to the letter of the law of commitments contained in the aforementioned written text.\u201d And as it\u2019s so quiet, you should certainly read and digest this piece by Dan Davies into whether the 2010 Greek bailout was a big mistake, or not. 2010 and all that \u2014 Relitigating the Greek bailout (Part 2) You might also enjoy: 2010 and all that \u2014 Relitigating the Greek bailout (Part 1) Both are well worth reading, as Dan takes a serious and highly readable look at the events of five years ago to answer whether of not policymakers should have let Greece default.... After the excitement of recent weeks, today has been quite a letdown. Here\u2019s the state of play: Negotiations between Greece and its creditors over a third bailout have hit a snag. They appear to be on hold until at least Monday, as the two sides argue about exactly where they will meet. One Greek official tells us: \u201cThey haven\u2019t arrived yet. There\u2019s been a delay. We don\u2019t know when talks will start but what we do know is that they will definitely start.\u201d The IMF\u2019s participation in the talks was also unclear this morning, after it emerged that Greece needed to send a formal invite.... Greece\u2019s leaders have been marking the 41st anniversary of the end of military rule. While on the streets, long queues have been sighted as pensioners collect this month\u2019s pensions. The financial markets remain more concerned about commodities than Greece. Around 12,000 job cuts were announced this morning as miners react to the recent drop in prices. There was no relief today, with platinum and copper sliding again and gold hitting a five and a half-year low. Copper and aluminium both also hit their lowest levels since 2009, in a broad-based selloff: Drafi was meant to be a new, green, development away from the bustle of Athens. But then the financial crisis struck....as photographer Panayis Chrysovergis shows here: Sounds like Greece\u2019s letter to the IMF is now in the post.... AP has also confirmed that \u2018technical issues\u2019 are holding back the start of the negotiations: Have negotiations between Greece and creditor institutions been put on hold? Over in Athens officials have told us that it now looks as if they will be delayed by a few days. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports Few things are ever assured in the ever-changing debt crisis engulfing Greece but of one thing officials are now certain: negotiations on a third, three-year bailout plan will not begin, as planned, today. Mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF were due to fly into Athens this morning and hit the ground running. One well-placed finance ministry official says: \u201cThey haven\u2019t arrived yet. There\u2019s been a delay. We don\u2019t know when talks will start but what we do know is that they will definitely start.\u201d Insiders say it is almost sure negotiations will now begin on Monday partly because of ongoing behind-the-scenes wrangling over where, exactly, the talks will take place. The top-level auditors want access to ministries and files \u2013 just as they had had before the radical left Syriza assumed power in January. \u201cA lot of trust has been lost and the big issue is who they are going to see, what ministries they are going to be let into, what files are going to be made available,\u201d said Anna Asimakopoulou, a shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party. She tells me: \u201cThat of course will be a big defeat for the government given that negotiations have moved to Brussels for the past six months but that is what they want, due diligence at a deeper level. Holding talks in a hotel is just not practical.\u201d Government officials confirmed that talks had also been delayed because of the IMF\u2019s unexpected demand that Greece formally request its participation in a new bailout programme. The Washington-based body\u2019s top spokesman, Gerry Rice, took many by surprise late Thursday with the announcement that the IMF could only consider a third bailout for the debt-stricken country if Athens submitted a formal application. There remains some uncertainty over whether the fund will extend its current financing program with Greece \u2013which ends in March 2016 \u2013 or do away with that and move ahead with a new package. \u201cThe IMF wanted a formal request and that is what we have been working on,\u201d the finance ministry official said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is in the post, so to speak, but if it isn\u2019t already, it is going to be very, very soon.\u201d Greece\u2019s political leaders will soon be tucking into their lunch to mark the end of the military junta in 1974. The slump in the oil price today is having a knock-on effect on Russia. The rouble has fallen 1.1% against the US dollar today, meaning it\u2019s lost around 17% of its value since mid-May: Germans are divided over whether they support Greece\u2019s third bailout, according to a new poll. But few believe it will stave off bankruptcy: Time for some Friday fun. Check out the FT\u2019s quiz on the Greek crisis, and see if you can beat my 75%: Greek Crisis Quiz (PS: there\u2019s some chatter on twitter that it doesn\u2019t work on some devices...) Negotiations between Greece and its creditors have hit a snag -- they need to find a location that is secure enough to host the talks. That means that only technical talks are taking place, not top-level negotiations, seemingly for fear that angry Greeks might disrupt them. Reuters has the story: \u201cThere are some logistical issues to solve, notably security-wise,\u201d a European Commission official said. \u201cSeveral options are on the table,\u201d the Commission official said, without giving more details. We\u2019ll have more on the state of play shortly.... More queues, this time outside the Deposits and Loans Fund (a credit institution) in Athens. Oil has just joined the commodities selloff -- with Brent crude hitting a three-month low : Back in Greece, party leaders should be getting spruced up for lunch with president Prokopis Pavlopoulos. The meeting will mark the end of the Greek military dictatorship on this day in 1974, but recent developments will also be on the menu. Pavlopoulos has already restated his position that Grexit is not an option, saying: \u201cEvery other choice except that of remaining in the eurozone would clearly be disastrous for society, for the economy and for the nation.\u201d Growth across the eurozone\u2019s companies has slowed this month, suggesting Greece\u2019s bailout drama had some impact on confidence. Markit\u2019s flash eurozone PMI composite output index, just released, fell to 53.7, from 54.2 in June. That shows a slower pace of expansion (although safely above the 50-point stagnation mark). The survey was taken just after Greece and its creditors struck a deal to open talks on a third bailout, at their weekend summit in Brussels. Markit explains: By country, growth slowed in Germany, albeit merely to a two-month low, while a three-month low was seen in France. Elsewhere in the region, the rate of expansion accelerated, pushing the pace of growth further ahead of both France and Germany yet failing to match the peaks seen earlier in the year. The survey data were collected between July 13- 23, after the July 5 Greek referendum and commencing on the day that Greece and its creditors subsequently struck an agreement on the country\u2019s third bailout, though there was little conclusive evidence from survey respondents as to the extent to which the events directly affected business activity either positively or negatively. However, business expectations about the year ahead in the dominant services economy dropped to the lowest seen so far this year, fuelled by weakened confidence in Germany and France, in a sign that the crisis appears to have dented business prospects. Looks like a busy day for banks in Athens too, as pensioners collect their monthly payments: The euro is sliding against the US dollar, as the latest economic data from France and Germany misses expectations. France\u2019s private sector output is growing at the slowest rate in three months, according to Markit\u2019s flash survey. And its factories are shrinking again, with manufacturing PMI dropping to 49.6 from 50.7 in June. French firms reported a slowdown in new business, suggesting growth is easing this summer. The picture was a little brighter in Germany, although growth across its service sectors and manufacturing firms both hit a two-month low: We get the overall eurozone PMI report in around 15 minutes. The commodities rout is now the biggest issue in the capital markets, according to Chris Weston of IG: The slump in the prices of platinum, gold, copper, zinc et al is now more serious than either Greece and the volatile Chinese stock market, he explains. This seems to be premised on a toxic mix of increasing future surplus figures (in the forecasts), but Chinese growth and concern of a September move from the Federal Reserve are also in play. I am personally sceptical as to whether we will start seeing downgrades to global growth forecasts of 3.5%. However, there are signs inflation expectations are starting to move lower. It\u2019s been a bleak weak for goldbugs too. Spot gold hit a new five-year low overnight, and is currently trading around $1,083 per ounce - down 4,5% since Friday night. It\u2019s on track for its worst weak since last October. Copper is also getting hammered again today. That\u2019s particularly concerning, as the metal is seen as a barometer of the health of the global economy A quick glance at the platinum price explains why producers such as Lonmin are finding life so tough - it\u2019s not been this low since the global recession of 2008-09. Two mining giants are slashing thousands of jobs each, as the recent slide in commodity prices hits home. Lonmin, the platinum producer, is to close or mothball several mines in South Africa, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. It blamed the slump in platinum prices, which are currently below the break-even point: \u201cLonmin is highly geared to platinum group metal prices. At current metal price levels, the company is EBITDA negative and our cost minimisation plans are designed to improve this position as much as possible.\u201d And Anglo American, the platinum and iron ore mining giant, is also finding conditions tough. It also announced plans to slash 6,000 jobs, and warned that the market could get worse. CEO Mark Cutifani cautioned: \u201cAt the moment I am not sure we are at the bottom, I hope we are but you can never be sure. Worrying news from China overnight - activity across its factories fell at the fastest pace since April 2014. The flash Caixin/Markit China Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) dropped to 48.2 in July. It\u2019s the 5th month running that activity has been below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion. It\u2019s going to add to concerns that the Chinese economy is struggling: Greece\u2019s creditors are arriving back in a country that is hamstring by capital controls. The Irish Times\u2019s Damian Mac Con Uladh reports seeing queues at banks in Corinth this morning, as people try to withdraw their maximum cash allowance for this week. Pensions have also been paid today, and people are understandably keen to get their hands on the money: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis and other events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. Six months is a long, long time in the eurozone. Back in January, Yanis Varoufakis declared that Greece would no longer negotiate with the hated Troika, and that things would be different from then on. Well, he gave it his best shot. But today, Varoufakis is no longer in the finance ministry and officials from Greece\u2019s creditors are heading back to the capital. They\u2019ll begin formal talks over a third Greek bailout, after MPs agreed to sweeping austerity measures and economic reforms. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, sets the scene: The return of the triumvirate, a day after internationally mandated reforms were pushed through the parliament by MPs, marks a personal defeat for the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who had pledged never to allow the auditors to step foot in Greece again. How Greeks will react remains unclear, with much depending on media coverage. \u201cThe press will almost certainly make a big deal out of this and the government will try to play it down,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a leading political commentator. \u201cBut given what people have gone through recently it might seem rather trivial and that is to Tsipras\u2019 advantage. Their presence will definitely reinforce the realisation that another bailout is here.\u201d It appears, though, that the full troika may not be in town together. The Kathimerini newspaper reckons the International Monetary Fund won\u2019t be in attendance: It says: IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday that Athens had not yet officially requested the Fund\u2019s participation in the third program. \u201cThe modalities and the process for the discussions are still to be decided.\u201d Also coming up today Economic surveys from across the globe will show how the world\u2019s factories are performing this month. China has already got off to a bad start (more on that in a moment). And the big story in the markets is the commodities selloff, as demand for metals slides sharply. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Betting firms Ladbrokes and Gala Coral have unveiled a long-awaited deal to create a \u00a32.3bn gambling giant, the biggest bookmaker in the UK. The move, which comes nearly two decades after a similar merger proposal failed, also handed Andy Hornby, the former boss of failed bank HBOS, a senior role in the new business. With nearly 4,000 betting shops and 30,000 employees, the combined group is set to overtake William Hill as Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker, although it will have to sell some outlets to satisfy any concerns from competition authorities. It will be called Ladbrokes Coral and will be listed on the London stock exchange, with both brands set to stay on the high street. Hornby, who was chief executive of HBOS when the bank almost imploded in 2008 and was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group, has been appointed chief operating officer of Ladbrokes Coral and is expected to pick up a large bonus. He will not sit on the board, however, after pressure from shareholders. Along with other HBOS directors, Hornby was condemned by the parliamentary commission on banking standards in 2013 for mistakes that led to the bank\u2019s \u201ccolossal failure\u201d. They are likely to come under fire again when a long-awaited regulatory report into HBOS is published. The bosses of Ladbrokes and Coral dismissed any concerns about Hornby\u2019s appointment. Jim Mullen, chief executive of Ladbrokes since March who will run the merged group, said: \u201cAndy Hornby is a first-class executive that this combined group is lucky to have.\u201d Ladbrokes, which boasts a 136-year history, has struggled to to embrace the internet in the same way as rivals William Hill and newer rivals such as Paddy Power and bet365, and hopes to catch up by joining forces with private equity-owned Coral. Ladbrokes, a FTSE 250 company, will issue new shares to the shareholders of Coral representing 48.25% of the company, with Ladbrokes shareholders owning 51.75%. The deal will bring together 2,100 shops from Ladbrokes and 1,845 from Coral, ahead of William Hill\u2019s 2,300 stores. Talks about the merger were first made public last month. The new group will have revenues of \u00a32.1bn and underlying profits of \u00a3392m. The deal is expected to bring savings of \u00a365m a year, largely by removing duplication in the back office. Gala Coral boss Carl Leaver, who will be executive deputy chairman for 12 months, said there will be no shop closures, and any stores that have to be disposed of for competition reasons will be sold as a going concern. He did not give any details on potential job cuts, beyond saying: \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say that there will be no job losses.\u201d The popularity of high stakes betting machines has helped give a fresh lease of life to betting shops in the face of tightening government regulation and rising tax pressures. The merged company views such retail business as its cash engine. In 1998, a similar merger proposal was vetoed by the then business secretary Peter Mandelson, who said a tie-up was not in the consumer interest. However, that ruling came before online gambling exploded, allowing many other players to take a slice of a much bigger market. Analysts at Stifel said: \u201cThe Coral transaction should provide considerable benefits for Ladbrokes\u2019 shareholders, but this assumes that competition issues can be satisfactorily resolved, which is a big \u2018if\u2019.\u201d Ladbrokes also reported first-half operating profit in line with expectations but said increased marketing investment would dent 2015 operating profit by \u00a320m, pushing guidance down to \u00a370m-\u00a375m for the year. Analysts at stockbroker Jefferies warned that it was a make-or-break deal for Ladbrokes, which has postponed announcing the outcome of a strategic review while it thrashed out a deal. Jefferies analyst Ian Rennardson said: \u201cWe think Ladbrokes is in the last chance saloon, having today announced a profit warning, a dividend cut, a share placing and an intended merger. \u201cWe remain sceptical about the merits of the strategic review and proposed merger with Gala Coral, and see gamblers as the only beneficiaries of what could prove to be a marketing \u2018race to the bottom\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar fell to a fresh six-year low and stocks across Asia dropped sharply after more signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The Aussie dipped below US73c for the first time since May 2009 on news that Chinese manufacturing activity slowed by more than expected, while good US jobs data bolstered bets that the Federal Reserve is on track to hike interest rates later this year. The flash Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 48.2, below economists\u2019 estimate for a reading of 49.7 and the lowest reading since April last year. It was the fifth straight month below 50, the level which separates contraction from expansion, and the lowest reading since April 2014. In early afternoon trade, the dollar was buying US72.86c having fallen as low as US72.70c. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s later reaffirmed Australia\u2019s prized triple-A credit rating but warned that it could be lowered \u201cif budgetary performance does not improve broadly as we currently expect\u201d. ThinkForex senior markets analyst Matt Simpson said the Chinese figures were yet another blow to the local currency, which was already under pressure. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tired Chinese growth, you\u2019ve got a strong greenback and you\u2019ve got falling commodity prices,\u201d he said. He tipped the currency to hit US70c later this year. On the stock markets, Japan\u2019s Nikkei index dipped almost 0.7%, even though a similar survey for Japan showed improvement. \u201cJapan\u2019s PMI was good, but Japanese stocks are reacting more to China\u2019s,\u201d said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. \u201cEveryone is concerned about the state of China\u2019s economy, and this reaction shows that market is very sensitive to information like this,\u201d she said. Hong Kong\u2019s Hangseng index was down 0.92% and the Shanghai Composite index, where many of the stocks are still suspended after June\u2019s crash, was up slightly by 0.16%. Australia\u2019s ASX200 benchmark index closed down 24 points, or 0.43% lower at 5566. The China survey reinforced expectations of more monetary easing ahead from Beijing. China looks set to further reduce interest rates and the amount of cash its banks must hold as reserves to try to keep its economy growing at 7% this year, which would be the slowest pace in a quarter of a century, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. Sliding commodity prices are also putting pressure on the Aussie dollar. The price of gold skidded 1.4% to $1,079 an ounce, its lowest level since 2010. It is now on track for a weekly loss of nearly 5%, after marking its deepest one-day loss in nearly two years on Monday. Copper, often seen as a bellwether of economic growth, slipped more than 1% to $US5,335 per tonne. However, crude oil futures rebounded from multi-month lows recorded overnight on Wednesday, with U.S. crude up about 0.7 percent at $48.79 a barrel, after marking its lowest settlement since March 31.",
