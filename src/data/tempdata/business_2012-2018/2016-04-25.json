      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our editorial on the collapse of BHS, and the long run of mistakes and poor business practices that led to today\u2019s administration: The Guardian view on BHS: murder on the high street It concludes: As the government-run Pension Protection Fund prepares to rescue the BHS pensioners, the familiar mismatch between private profits and public losses is in evidence once again. eanwhile, hollowed-out husks could soon blight 100-plus high streets, yet another story of common space being disfigured after private greed enjoyed free reign. And a community used to being fleeced could be left with another nasty outbreak of British heist sores. And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up until tomorrow... Goodnight, and thanks for the comments. GW The BHS crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u2019s Guardian, and the news that its newish owners have taken \u00a325m out of the firm. Sarah Butler has looked into how the Green family have benefited from BHS over the years, and writes: When Sir Philip Green bought BHS in May 2000, he insisted it would not be rocket science to revive the ailing high street retailer. After paying \u00a3200m, he was convinced he had the skills to secure its future and make it the foundation of a sprawling retail empire. But last year, after failing in his mission, Green sold BHS for \u00a31 to a little known group of investors who have steered it into collapse in just over 12 months. His dreams for the chain may have come to nothing, but Green\u2019s family have still been big winners from BHS, taking out more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans to help fund a lavish lifestyle.... More here: Writing in the Guardian tonight, retail expert Mary Portas argues that BHS could have been saved from collapse with a bit more imagination. Here\u2019s a flavour: If I had been at British Home Stores I would have looked at today\u2019s market place and created a brand that is relevant for today\u2019s shopper. I would have gone totally after the value market, but made it functional and cool. I would have started with where it was good \u2013 the lighting. Then I would have extended that to become a modern British lifestyle retailer at a great price. Look at Tiger, which has come on to our high streets. It has done an extraordinary job of taking that basic fundamental market, that was the old Woolies, and made it sexy. Imagine if British Home Stores\u2019 ground floor was like Tiger, its fashion floor like Uniqlo or Primark and its home stuff like Ikea. Value with sex appeal all under one roof. Then add some small startups that are all young British makers or designers.... It\u2019s a balmy 16 degrees in Monaco tonight. But if Sir Philip Green is there, he may just have felt the chill of criticism from the House of Commons. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle put the former BHS owner firmly in the spotlight this afternoon, saying he faces \u201cserious questions\u201d. She basically accused Green of taking far more out of BHS (\u00a3422m) than he paid for it (\u00a3200m), before \u2018walking away\u2019 to his favourite tax haven. That will sting Green, who is sensitive to criticism over his ownership of BHS. But the toughest criticism actually came from Conservative MP Richard Fuller. He gave Green both barrels, saying he actually received \u201830 pieces of silver\u2019 for BHS, if he knowingly abandoned workers and pensioners to their fate. Fuller also channelled former PM Edward Heath, using the killer phrase \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism\u2019 to describe those who renege on their pension liabilities. A rare experience, to be compared to both Tiny Rowland and Judas. MPs also remember the experience with Comet, where the taxpayer found itself on the hook for thousands of redundancy payments. They won\u2019t accept the Pension Protection Fund being stung this time, if it can be avoided. And if Anna Soubry had a secret rescue plan for BHS, she\u2019s keeping it to herself. The government view is that the retailer is a victim of changing shopping patterns and structural change - which is why finding a buyer has been so tough. Soubry kept repeating that BHS stores are open, but if a buyer isn\u2019t found soon, that won\u2019t last..... The final question goes to Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP. The real scandal is that BHS workers face redundancies, and losing 10% of their pensions. Can the minister promise that all inquiries into BHS will be open and transparent, and that the \u2018full force of the law\u2019 will be used, if needed? Yes, Soubry replies. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Labour MP Diana Johnson warns parliament that BHS could be a repeat of the collapse of Comet. When Comet went into administration in 2012, there were 7,000 redundancies and the taxpayer paid up to \u00a3100m in redundancy costs. Comet had been owned by a private equity firm which bought the firm for a pound, loaded it with debt, and then walked away. The government should publish its report into Comet, so we can see if lessons can be learned. Anna Soubry promises to find out what happened to that report. Cardiff MP Jo Stephens asks whether the Insolvency Service has the resources to help BHS workers, given its budget is being cut. Soubry says she has full confidence in the insolvency service. Labour MP Gavin Shuker says the UK retail sector is dominated by low pay and lack of opportunity, and also dominated by women workers. Will the government do more to help regenerate the sector? Soubry says employers she has met are committed to helping their staff develop, but agrees that anything that helps female workers must be welcomed. SNP MP Roger Mullin says BHS workers are paying the price for Philip Green\u2019s failure, while he awaits for his new yacht. Why shouldn\u2019t Green be forced to pay the full \u00a3591m pension blackhole? Soubry says that it\u2019s important to do the right thing for workers who have paid into a pension their whole working life. Our market economy is dangerously undermined when the privatisation of vast profits isswiftly followed by the projections of similarly large losses onto other people, whether taxpayers or pensioners, says Conservative MP Steve Baker. Could the government look at the treatment of excessive debt, to avoid a repeat? Soubry says there are always lessons to be learned, but reiterates that BHS is still open and looking for a buyer. Q: Will Anna Soubry meet with the USDAW union to discuss how to save BHS jobs? I\u2019ll meet with pretty much anyone, Soubry replies. She\u2019s happy to meet USDAW, and try to persuade them to change their view on Sunday trading. Q: Does Soubry know whether the BHS trustees signed off the BHS \u00a31 last year. Were the Pension Protection Fund involved? And if not, could we close this loophole? Soubry says she doesn\u2019t know, but will write and find out.... Grimsby MP Melanie Onn says her constituency has lost Woolworths, Comet, Staples, Phones4U and now a WHSmiths store. She asks Soubry if she is concerned that BHS generated \u00a3100m through \u2018negative goodwill\u2019, which was then paid out in dividends rather than reinvested. Soubry replies that she actually recently shopped in Grimsby (eliciting an inaudible, but seemingly amusing, reply from Onn). Soubry replies that capitalism must have a caring heart. She agrees that Fuller is raising very serious issues, and we must see what conclusions the regulators come to. If there are any suggestions of impropriety, we will come after people, she adds. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, says that the former owner of BHS [Philip Green] may have gone \u201claughing all the way to the bank\u201d when Retail Acquisitions offered to buy the group for \u00a31. But.... If that sale was done on the understanding that he was avoiding a responsibility for those pension losses, then \u00a31 was equivalent to 30 pieces of silver for that betrayal of the employees and pensioners. There is a reputational question here for Philip Green to answer, Fuller continues. The minister must write to him, and ask him to address these issues. And the government must assess the Pension Protection Fund, to avoid \u201cthis unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d of passing losses onto the taxpayer. SNP MP Alison Thewliss asks what the government is doing for workers at other companies why rely on BHS. Soubry says that we know that other companies in a supply chain suffer when one business fails. That\u2019s why we must stay positive and hope a buyer can be found. Conservative MP Peter Bottomley say he visited a BHS branch today and told workers that they have the full support of the House of Commons. Workers jobs and pensions must be a top priority, he adds. BHS has suffered from online sales, Soubry replies, and also from the fact people are less loyal to individual retailers these days. If you\u2019ve got BHS vouchers, go and spend them and support the staff, and the high street, she declares. Labour MP Ian Wright says it cannot be right for Philip Green to load BHS up with debt, fail to invest, pay his wife \u00a3400m in dividends, and live in a tax haven. Something is gravely wrong, he says. New legislation is needed to prevent owners making a fast buck. Soubry says that any allegations of impropriety must be taken very seriously. The SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell says her party stand in solidarity with BHS workers at this time. She says there are some very serious allegations in the newpapers today, including the FT\u2019s article about the \u00a31bn \u2018siphoned out of BHS\u2019 The gap in BHS\u2019s pension fund merits serious investigation, she adds. Anna Soubry repeats that BHS stores are still open, and it\u2019s important not to talk the company into a deeper crisis. Conservative MP Mark Field says he is concerned that the Pension Protection Fund is being used as a bargaining chip, rather than in exceptional cases when a firm fails. Field says he shares the opposition\u2019s concern over the behaviour of the current and former BHS owners. Soubry agrees that the PPF should not be abused. Anna Soubry\u2019s statement on BHS is online here. Responding to Eagle, Soubry says her concern is for the workers at BHS, and its creditors. Eagle is turning this into a party political game, she claims. The Pensions Regulator is investigating the BHS pension blackhols now. And the insolvency service will take allegations of malpractice very seriously. Soubry also claims that the opposition would have more credibility if they hadn\u2019t voted against Sunday trading changes - which might have helped BHS. Philip Green has taken hundreds of millions out of BHS, and then walked away to his favourite tax haven leaving the pensions protection scheme to pick up the bill, Eagle continues. She cites the Guardian\u2019s revelation that BHS\u2019s new owner, Retail Acquisitions, has received more than \u00a325m in the last 13 months. She asks Anna Soubry to comment on Green\u2019s conduct as BHS\u2019s owner, and whether she agrees that owners should be forced to make a fair contribution Green has reportedly offered \u00a340m to the pensions black hole - is that acceptable? And will the government review the law to prevent irresponsible owners walking away and leaving others with the liabilities? Labour shadow minister Angela Eagle responds to Anna Soubry. 11,000 BHS staff will be very worried today. All MPs must hope that BHS can be sold as a going concern. But if the worst happens, the government must offer support to workers. Philip Green has some serious questions to answer, Eagle continues, having bought it for \u00a3200m, taken \u00a3422m of dividends, then sold it for \u00a31. He seems to have taken out far more from the business than he paid for it, she says. The pension fund had a \u00a3500 surplus when Green bought it, but this had become a deficit of hundreds of millions when he sold it, Eagle adds. Anna Soubry adds that there has been \u201csome speculation about the BHS pension scheme\u201d. She can\u2019t comment directly, but understands that the Pension Protection Fund is assessing the final funding position of the scheme, and who is responsible for its shortfall. Over in parliament, small business minister Anna Soubry is making a statement about BHS\u2019s collapse now. Soubry says that it is very difficult time for all the employees - up to 11,000 across the UK. It\u2019s also a difficult time for the company\u2019s creditors. The BHS name has been synonymous with British high streets for over 80 years, she continues, and still has a high street presence. She continues that the \u201cclear message\u201d is that BHS is still open for business. I understand that there are no plans for immediate redundancies or store closures, and that the administrators are looking to sell BHS as a going concern. If you\u2019ve been following the blog today, you\u2019ll already know that Damien has been interviewing shoppers about the decline and fall of BHS. Here\u2019s his full piece from Oxford Street: While we wait for the government\u2019s statement on BHS, here\u2019s a picture of Sir Philip Green\u2019s new superyacht: More details are emerging of payments made to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS in 2015 for \u00a31. Graham Ruddick and Sarah Butler report that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions, in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and it collapsing into administration. Sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances say that the payments to Retail Acquisitions included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Here\u2019s their full story: And if you are just joining us, here\u2019s the main news story on BHS collapsing into administration: Meanwhile, Simon Goodley has been looking into Dominic Chappell, the 49-year-old racing driver-turned-entrepreneur, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has closed down 0.8% or almost 50 points, at just shy of 6261. Miners and energy companies have pulled the wider index down as oil prices have slipped - Brent crude is down 0.7% at $44.8 per barrel. As we reported earlier, the news that BHS has collapsed into administration, did little to dent investor appetite for retailers\u2019 shares. Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up more than 1%, ASOS shares are up 0.9% and Boohoo is up 5.3%. But Debenhams shares are down 1% and Next is down 0.2%. Over on Wall Street it\u2019s been a subdued start to the week for US stocks. Hurt by weaker oil prices and jitters ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.6% at around 17,893 and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.5% at 2,081. Earlier we heard from the head of shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, John Hannet, on how administrators will want to avoid repeating mistakes made after Woolworths\u2019 demise in 2008. Readers may remember that in 2012, 24,000 former staff of Woolworths were awarded compensation worth 60 days\u2019 pay because the stores had been closed without consultation after the chain collapsed. Nicholas Le Riche, employment partner at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell says although BHS stores are still trading for now and a buyer for the company is being sought, \u201cit is likely that stores will be forced to close resulting in widespread redundancies.\u201d BHS will be expected to consult collectively with the Usdaw trade union and other relevant employee representatives, says Le Riche. He explains: The need to follow a fair process was illustrated by the collapse of Woolworths, which saw large claims over how the redundancy consultation had been conducted. On top of compensation for unfair dismissal, employees may also be entitled to up to 90 days\u2019 pay if there has been a failure in the collective consultation procedures. More commentary is coming in on how much, or how little, BHS\u2019s position is a function of the current retail climate. Gary Hobbs, senior equity analyst at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says: \u201cWhilst conditions on the high street have been tough, as witnessed by the likes of Next, we suspect that the travails at BHS are as much a function of their financial position as they are a reflection of slower trading. \u201cWe do not envisage any material ramifications elsewhere for retailers, though there might be some work to do for the landlords of BHS\u2019 store portfolio.\u201d Some of BHS\u2019s retail rivals - with the notable exception of Next - seem to be faring well from its bad news on stock markets this afternoon. Connor Campbell, financial analyst spread betting company Spreadex comments: After teasing flatness at lunchtime the FTSE gave up the ghost as the day went on, reverting back to a 40 point loss as a dismal showing from its commodity stocks compounded the sense of unease that greeted BHS filing for administration. \u201cBHS\u2019 rivals have largely benefited from its collapse this Monday, be it online stores like ASOS and Boohoo (the latter seeing a 5% rise ahead of its preliminary results tomorrow), or similarly recognisable high street staples like Marks &amp; Spencer and Sports Direct. Interestingly Next bucked this trend, falling nearly 1.5% as the company\u2019s investors wondered if they were looking at the Ghost of High Street Future.\u201d Shares in Next are down around 1.2%, ASOS shares are up 0.5%, Boohoo is up 4.7%, Sports Direct is up 0.6% and Marks &amp; Spencer shares are up 0.8%. Back on Oxford Street, Damien Gayle, has been sounding out more shoppers on what went wrong at BHS. \u201cWhat\u2019s BHS - is that a sandwich?\u201d asked Jason Knight, 21, as he and his friends drank coffee outside Starbucks. He appeared to only be half joking. But his friend Amy West (pictured), 23, was at least aware of the retail chain\u2019s existence. Had she ever shopped there? \u201cI have, when I was a kid though, my nan used to take me there. Me and my nan used to pop into the shopping centre and she used to say: \u2018I just have to go into BHS\u2019.\u201d If you are just joining us, here\u2019s our latest news story on BHS collapsing into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. Amid the the biggest failure on the high street since that of Woolworths in 2008, there are fears for the jobs of the BHS\u2019s 11,000 employees. The government is expected to make a statement on the failure of the 88-year-old retail group in parliament later this afternoon - probably around 5pm. On financial markets, it\u2019s been a lacklustre day for the FTSE 100 share index. The bluechips index is currently down around 44 points, or 0.7%, 6267. This week marks one year since the index hit its record closing leavel of 7,103. The FTSE is now down almost 12% from that high point. But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown has been taking a closer look and notes that behind the headline drop in the index, a high proportion of UK companies and funds have prospered over the last year. One third of FTSE 100 companies have seen a share price rise since the index peaked and 36% of UK funds have made a positive return since the peak. Khalaf comments: Last April the market was riding high with the Footsie breaking new ground for the first time since 1999. Twelve months on, and the UK\u2019s headline index has had a reality check, losing a fifth of its value from peak to trough, as commodity and banking stocks plummeted. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get carried away with the twists and turns of the FTSE 100, but it\u2019s important to bear in mind the headline index is heavily influenced by the performance of the largest stocks, so doesn\u2019t give the full picture of how UK plc is doing. \u201cOne third of the stocks in the Footsie have risen over the last year, though they haven\u2019t been able to outweigh the black hole left by big oil, big mining, and big finance.\u201d Damien Gayle has been speaking to more shoppers on and around Oxford Street this afternoon and getting more of a sense of how UK consumers have fallen out of love with BHS. Hayden Clottey, 23, was browsing the boutiques of Carnaby Street, close to the BHS flagship store. Asked why he wasn\u2019t shopping in BHS, he said: I\u2019ve shopped there before. I used to have a friend who worked there. It\u2019s alright, you can get pretty much everything there. It\u2019s always a safe bet when you have to get presents for people - just the little packages of soap and things like that. I wouldn\u2019t selectively go in there I suppose.\u201d Jasmin Steiner, 20, and Holly Hicks Holcroft, 18, were also browsing Carnaby Street\u2019s boutiques. Asked how they felt about BHS\u2019s financial troubles, Hicks Holcroft replied: It doesn\u2019t really bother me - it\u2019s no Woolworths. Bring on change. \u201c I can remember going there with my nan. It was that sort of shop that you go to with your nan and your parents. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I guess but it\u2019s making room for more stuff.\u201d Steiner said they had been out shopping at Monkey, a nearby boutique. We look at everything that\u2019s really expensive and then go to buy it in Primark,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought anything from there [BHS]. Maybe we will go and look when everything\u2019s on sale, get my nan\u2019s Christmas presents for the next five years.\u201d Our financial editor Nils Pratley has some stern words of advice for Dominic Chappell, boss of BHS owner Retail Acquisitions, and he has some tough questions about the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund and the onus on previous BHS owner Sir Philip Green to sort out the mess. Nils notes how Chappell is \u201ccrassly missing the required tone\u201d when he writes in an email to staff: \u201cI would like to say it has been a real pleasure working with all of you on the BHS project, one I will never forget.\u201d \u201cNo, Mr Chappell, BHS was never a \u201cproject\u201d for the staff. It is how they earned their living and made plans to fund their retirement,\u201d writes Nils. On the pension problems, he continues: Given the odds against the BHS \u201cproject\u201d succeeding \u2013 there is an urgent question. How much responsibility for the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund lies with Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell and his inexperienced crew for \u00a31 a year ago. The answer is clearly not none. The principle is clear: former owners cannot wash their hands of a pensions problem simply by selling a business for a token sum... Prepare to dig deep, Sir Philip: forget Topshop, the yachts (a new 300-footer is on the way), the fashion academy and the knighthood. Your contribution to retailing will be remembered chiefly by the decency, or otherwise, of your behaviour towards BHS pensioners. Read the full column here: Usdaw - the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers - has put out a statement calling for urgent talks with BHS. General secretary John Hannett has also drawn parallels with Woolworths as he urges the administrators to include workers in their decisions. Hannett says in a statement: \u201cThis is devastating news for the employees of BHS and we urge the company to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time. \u201cWe also urge the administrators and the company to comply with the law, consult with staff and Usdaw as the union for BHS workers. We don\u2019t want to see BHS staff locked out of discussions, sent to the back of the queue of creditors and treated like fixtures and fittings, as happened at Woolworths.\u201d \u201cThe Government needs to intervene now to protect taxpayers from picking up the bill for redundancy payments and safeguard the Pension Protection Fund. \u201cWe are in touch with our members working in BHS to reassure them that we will provide the support, advice and representation they require.\u201d Moving away from developments at BHS for a moment, jobs are also under threat at oil company Royal Dutch Shell. Shell is closing three UK offices, affecting 1,600 employees, including BG\u2019s headquarters in Reading, after its \u00a335bn takeover of the oil and gas company earlier this year, my colleague Nick Fletcher reports. The company has also begun a voluntary redundancy programme as part of a plan to cut 10,300 jobs across the merged group, comprising 7,500 from the original Shell business, as it attempts to cope with the recent plunge in oil prices, and another 2,800 following the merger with BG. The Reading office will close by the end of the year and the 800 staff based there will be offered the chance to move to Shell\u2019s central London base, which will house the entirety of the company\u2019s south-east England operations. Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full story: The time of that statement to parliament has shifted again, now to the slightly earlier time of 5pm Time for a quick recap. Britain is facing its biggest retail failure since Woolworths collapsed in 2008. BHS, which employs 11,000 people, is now in the hands of administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps. They have promised to keep stores open, as they seek to sell the company as a going concern. Many analysts have warned that stores are likely to shut, with the best possibly \u2018cherry-picked\u2019 by rival retailers. Shoppers have told us of their sadness over BHS\u2019s demise. One lady warned that older shoppers will be disadvantaged if the brand vanishes from the high street. Younger consumers, though, say the company simply failed to move with the times. Business minister Anna Soubry is expected to give a statement to parliament about BHS this afternoon. It could be at 5.30pm Former owner, the retail chief Sir Philip Green, is also in the spotlight. The FT has highlighted how he took large dividends out of the company, before eventually selling it for \u00a31 last year. The Pensions Regulator has reportedly opened an investigation into BHS\u2019s pension scheme. It is currently facing a \u00a3571m black hole; Green could potentially be asked to cover some of this. The collapse of BHS is a personal blow to Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell: Our colleague Amelia Gentleman would like to hear from BHS staff: Sir Philip Green\u2019s 15-year ownership of BHS is in the spotlight today. The Financial Times\u2019s Alphaville site have published a handy explanation of how the Green family did rather well out of the retailer. FT: Would 11,000 BHS workers still have jobs if Tina Green hadn\u2019t siphoned \u00a31bn out of the business? Here\u2019s a flavour: Here, in very rough terms, is how the finances worked. It\u2019s an open question as to whether, with a little less financial engineering, this business might yet have survived. Green, a short man with a famous temper, acquired BHS (on behalf of his wife) for a pittance back in 2000. The store chain was in dire shape, but was conceivably worth more than he had paid. So Green booked circa \u00a3100m of \u2018negative\u2019 goodwill through the P&amp;L, declaring BHS to be surprisingly profitable. Magic. The parent company was then loaded with debt and the bulk of the cash was sent, via dividends, to Tina in Monaco. Precious little went into BHS, which continued to struggle.... Eventually, Green sold the group for \u00a31. But he\u2019d also built a retail empire with Top Shop, of course, helping to fund those super-yachts..... Then again.... Update: business minister Anna Soubry will speak to parliament about the BHS crisis, at around 4.30pm.... BHS vouchers can still be used to part-purchase goods, reports Sky News\u2019s Dharshini David: We mentioned earlier that Which? have urged people to spend gift vouchers immediately, they are treated as unsecured creditors once a firm enters administration. This is obviously hugely frustrating for people who have received vouchers - particularly if a retailer goes belly-up just after Christmas. Insolvency trade body R3 explains why it\u2019s a tough decision for administrators: Accepting vouchers could: Hurt other creditors by reducing the value of assets available for other creditors (by reducing stock); Deter potential buyers who may not wish to take on the obligation to honour vouchers; Reduce the value of an offer for the retailer given the size of the potential liability. But not accepting vouchers could: Damage the relationship between the business and its customers; Damage confidence in the business among potential investors. The government is expected to make a statement on BHS\u2019s fall into administration in the next few hours. It will either come from business secretary Sajid Javid, or small business minister Anna Soubry: BHS staff look downbeat as they walk in and out of the company\u2019s HQ this lunchtime. Those approached by the Guardian refused to comment on the firm\u2019s financial situation, as the administrators take control of the firm. Meanwhile, TV cameras stood trained on the sliding doors and journalists clutching notepads shuffled to keep warm. BREAKING: BHS has officially fallen into administration, and is now under the control of Duff &amp; Phelps. Here\u2019s the official statement, which confirms they will keep BHS stores open while they try to sell the group as a \u2018going concern\u2019. Philip Duffy and Benjamin Wiles, Managing Directors at Duff &amp; Phelps have today been appointed Joint Administrators of BHS (The Group). The Group has been undergoing restructuring and, as has been widely reported, the shareholders have been in negotiations to find a buyer for the business. These negotiations have been unsuccessful. In addition property sales have not materialised as expected in both number and value. Consequently, as a result of a lower than expected cash balance, the Group is very unlikely to meet all contractual payments. The Directors therefore have no alternative but to put the Group into administration to protect it for all creditors. The Group will continue to trade as usual whilst the Administrators seek to sell it as a going concern. Further announcements will be made as appropriate in due course. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our updated news story on the BHS crisis: BHS is going into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. The collapse of the retailer, which employs 11,000 people, will be the biggest failure on the high street since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. Staff have been told this morning that BHS has called in Duff &amp; Phelps as administrators and should formally enter insolvency procedure today. The formal administration will begin when it is approved by the high court, a statement from Duff &amp; Phelps is expected shortly. The collapse of the 88 year old BHS presents another problem for government as it attempts to save thousands of jobs in the steel industry. BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent.... Full story here: Sajid Javid, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, has tweeted that the government is doing its bit: Javid has a lot on his plate - he\u2019s already trying to avoid the loss of 4,000 jobs in the steel industry. Having bought BHS for just \u00a31 last year, will Retail Acquisitions end up in profit despite administration? Pension regulators could force former owner Sir Philip Green to help cover the BHS pensions black hole. Last month, the Mail on Sunday reported that they\u2019re considering asking Sir Philip for at least \u00a3300m to cover the \u00a3571m pension black hole. As Nick Hood pointed out this morning, business owners can\u2019t just sell up and abandon pensioners. And after taking an estimated \u00a3400m dividends out of BHS, Green is in the spotlight. Especially as he\u2019s taking delivery of a new \u00a3100m superyacht - his third! Dubbed Lionheart (the yacht, not Sir Philip), it will apparently be as long as a football pitch, and four storeys high, with all the swimming pools and jacuzzis one could ever need. Dr Gordon Fletcher of the University of Salford says BHS has failed to keep up with retail trends, or lose its image as a Baby Boomers store. The utilitarian model of retailing everything within one physical store simply does not appeal to younger generations and along with the soaring cost of servicing pensions the fate of this stalwart appears sealed. Being cheap, but not cheap enough to compete, coupled with being a landmark brand while not offering anything distinctive produces that particularly bland region of retailing that BHS has increasingly occupied. Mrs Condon from Camden has emerged from BHS\u2019s Oxford Street store carrying bulging bags. And like Louise Simpson, she\u2019s bought some cushions - apparently a BHS staple. Mrs Condon tells us that the failure of BHS was tragic: \u201cI love that store. We don\u2019t go down here very often, but I\u2019ve always loved BHS. It\u2019s got a variety of things, whatever you need it\u2019s there for you.\u201d Asked what she had bought, Condon, who gave her age as in her 70s, replied: \u201cI wanted some cushions, some bath towels, sheets and bits and bobs you don\u2019t need to know about.\u201d Back on Oxford Street, Louise Simpson, 40, from Wakefield is passing time with her dad, Bill Hardy, while her daughter had an interview for a place at Rada, the nearby performing arts college. She emerged from BHS with shopping bags bulging with new living room cushions. Asked about the business going bust, she tells Damien Gayle that: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a sad day to be honest.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure of the reasons for the business failing, but Bill, 69, cut in with \u201clack of customers.\u201d He explains: \u201cWhen you go in there there\u2019s not many people walking around buying stuff. Back to the old saying: people haven\u2019t got the money.\u201d Louise adds: \u201cTo be honest it\u2019s internet shopping for me. It\u2019s age. Parents will probably just keep shopping around but we will just Google it. I think the Internet has got a lot to say for a lot of shops (which are closing down). Probably won\u2019t be the last either.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to put a bet on which one will be next,\u201d Bill added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to think that they are going under considering how long they have been going.\u201d Meanwhile, the Oxford Street store seemed to be attracting plenty of interest. Plenty of shoppers went through its swing doors. Few however emerged with any purchases. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says BHS\u2019s current owners have not performed well: Having purchased the retail chain for just \u00a31 [in March 2015], Retail Acquisitions has shown little appetite or acumen for retail management, despite its name. Its owner Dominic Chappelle is a former racing driver with more experience of bankruptcy than retail. In addition to his hefty salary he has been involved in a number of questionable transactions, such as reportedly diverting funds borrowed by BHS to its directors while pushing landlords to accept rent reductions. On the retail side a successful repositioning of the brand and product portfolio has not materialised and much of the company\u2019s recent strategy has centred on selling off prime properties to keep creditors at bay. Guardian Witness would like to hear from BHS staff, and from former workers worries about their pension: Retail commentator Paul Mitchell sees more trouble ahead: A 66-year-old woman from St. John\u2019s Wood, who declined to give her name, said she always gets her clothes from BHS. \u201cI\u2019m so upset!\u201d She exclaimed when Damien asked about the shops financial troubles. \u201cThe prices are reasonable and I just like it. Marks and Spencer are too upmarket now, all it is is business suits and business blouses and they are totally out of touch with people like me. \u201cI\u2019ve just bought a swimming costume the other week. It\u2019s \u00a328 in here and \u00a335 in Marks, and I got 25% off so it came down to about \u00a310 difference. It\u2019s things like that. Maybe you could say BHS are probably for my age group but there\u2019s some nice stuff for the younger generation as well.\u201d Today, she said, she was going in to buy sandals for a forthcoming holiday. And she agreed that BHS\u2019s demise would be the end of a British institution. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real, real shame because to me John Lewis and Debenhams are too expensive now. Primark\u2019s quality is not that great, plus they are more for the younger generation. There\u2019s not many shops now that cater for the older woman.\u201d BHS\u2019s owner has confirmed that the administrators have arrived, reports Ben Martin of the Telegraph: The press are gathering on Oxford Street.... This is why BHS has struggled to find new funding: Andri Antoniades, 59, from Cyprus, and her husband are browsing the Oxford Street shops during a holiday to London. They already know about BHS\u2019s problems. And speaking to Damien Gayle, they raised the topic of Philip Green\u2019s \u00a31.2bn dividend [from his Arcadia empire in 2005] and his subsequent sale of the business for \u00a31 last year. Andri said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good and this is what happens at the end of the day. He brought in a famous model [Caprice] he was trying to upmarket the look, but obviously it\u2019s gone a bit wrong.\u201d The Antoniades didn\u2019t plan to buy anything from BHS, just take a look. Her husband broke in with a smile: \u201cWe\u2019ve just come to see it before it collapsed!\u201d Andri added: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to say I was there...\u201d Nicolette Kadzeya, 39, was waiting with her three children outside BHS\u2019s store on Oxford Street when it opened. She believes the company has failed to keep pace with the changing times, my colleague Damien Gayle reports: Kadzeya had read about the firms\u2019s problems but hoped it would open because she had to exchange an unwanted item \u201cI think the problem with BHS is that this branch is very up to date but if you go to the branch in Surrey Quays it\u2019s as if you have gone back in time. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone back to the mid-90s. \u201cSome of the branches which are outside of London are not that well maintained. It\u2019s a bit old fashioned as well. They are good for school shoes but it\u2019s not really up to date.\u201d She couldn\u2019t talk for long though.... \u201cI think they are open so I have to make it fast,\u201d Kadzeya said as she wheeled her buggy inside. BHS\u2019s store in Oxford Street doesn\u2019t look terribly busy, but at least it\u2019s open for business this morning: A BHS spokesperson has confirmed that the administration process is underway: BHS\u2019s social media team are doing their best to remain upbeat today, and ready to help: Customers are showing their support too: We\u2019re expecting BHS to file for administration as soon as the UK courts are open for business: Newsflash: German business confidence is weaker than expected, according to the latest survey from the IFO thinktank. IFO\u2019s business confidence reading has dipped to 106.6, from 106.7 last month, with firms reporting that conditions have become tougher. Anyone holding BHS gift vouchers should spend them right now, says Alex Neill, head of campaigns at consumer group Which. She points out that administrators are not obliged to accept gift vouchers - even though the company has already received the monay for them. Which explains: When a company goes into administration the administrators get certain powers to help turn the company around. These powers enable them to refuse to accept vouchers if they consider this is in the best interests of the company. Keep an eye on the administration progresses as the administrators may initially decide not to take vouchers and then later decide they will. The crisis at BHS highlights wider problems in the retail sector , argues Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. It\u2019s not just BHS that\u2019s suffering - shares are down sector-wide over the last 12 months \u2013 reflecting investor caution about an industry that\u2019s increasingly dependent on cheap credit and little else to drive it. The concern is that if interest rates rise \u2013 which they will have to do sooner or later - consumers will quickly tighten their belts and dispense with their credit cards. Meanwhile, retailers\u2019 margins are being squeezed by the new living wage, which is driving up wage costs when there is little sign of meaningful sales price growth. BHS may have been another Woolworths that struggled to adapt to the new retail world. But the same pressures that squeezed the life out of BHS are being felt across the UK retail sector today. Trouble on the high street is usually a sign of more deep-seated problems in the UK\u2019s economy.\u201d Austin Reed, another high street name, went into administration last week too, despite the patronage of IMF chief Christine Lagarde.... BHS staff are due to learn at 11am that their jobs are at \u201cvery high risk\u201d after efforts to create a rescue deal over the weekend failed, says the BBS\u2019s Simon Jack. Administrators Duff &amp; Phelps are lined up to take control, and will try to sell BHS as a going concern. That will be tough, though, as the company needs \u00a3100m of fresh funding. BHS is paying the price for not keeping track with its customers\u2019 changing needs, says Phil Dorrell, Partner, Retail Remedy retail consultants. Dorrell agrees that the company\u2019s better stores will be \u2018cherry-picked\u2019: When the administrators are called in, there won\u2019t be a retailer to buy BHS wholesale. Expect a piecemeal sale of specific sites in strategic locations to John Lewis possibly or Sports Direct or Next. Sadly this is probably the beginning of the end for BHS on our High Streets. It would take a brave and innovative business to buy the brand and turn it into an ongoing concern. BHS can trace its history back to 1928, when it was created as a British rival to Woolworths. It floated five years later, spending 65 years on the stock market until retail magnate Philip Green took it over in 2000. Our BHS timeline has the details: Nick Hood adds that BHS\u2019s profitable stores will probably cherry-picked, perhaps by Sports Direct. That would save some jobs, but as he tells the Today Programme: Ultimately, we\u2019ve got 11,000 jobs at risk here and the pensions of 20,000 people. It\u2019s a disaster. The pension fund currently faces a \u00a3576m deficit, but that would \u2018escalate\u2019 if BHS fails and the deficit is \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Q: Could they go after Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, who sold BHS for a pound last year? Pension liabilities are like Hotel California, Hood says, you can check out but never leave. The Pension Protection Fund will be looking very closely, and could issue a contribution notice to people who have been connected with the fund, Hood adds. The initial offer I believe Sir Philip made of \u00a340m, plus a \u00a340m loan on top, won\u2019t cut the mustard. Inevitably, a much higher contribution will be required. BHS\u2019s options are \u201cdistinctly limited\u201d as it totters on the brink of administration, warns Nick Hood, business risk adviser at the insolvency practitioners Opus. Speaking on the Today Programe, Hood says BHS has suffered from years of serious underinvestment, and lost over \u00a3400m over the last six years. Retail these days is all about heavy investment in staying up with the trend, online offerings, mobile offerings. None of this has happened at BHS. This has awful exchoes of what you and I were discussing in 2008 over the demise of Woolworths. Another retail business that hasn\u2019t stayed up with the times. One of Britain\u2019s longest-running retail chains is on the brink of collapse. It\u2019s almost 90 years since British Home Stores was founded. And BHS could fall into administration this morning, as hopes of a last-minute deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct fade. With 11,000 jobs at risk, plus the pensions of tens of thousands of former workers, it could be the biggest retail failure since Woolworths eight years My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: BHS has failed to secure emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and its rent. The restructuring firm Duff &amp; Phelps is set to be appointed as administrators on Monday, unless \u00a360m can be found to keep BHS afloat in the short term. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said: \u201cWhat was on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient and we have been working in the last few days to fill the gap.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level since early March this morning, after President Barack Obama made his dramatic intervention into the EU referendum debate. Sterling jumped by more than half a cent in early trading against the US dollar, hitting $1.4475 for the first time in five weeks. Obama\u2019s warnings against Brexit have enraged the \u201cOut campaign\u201d, but traders are calculating that they could sway undecided voters ahead of the June 23 referendum. On Friday night, the US president insisted that Britain would be at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d to arrange a trade deal with America. Later he said it could take a decade - comments reiterated by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Economists expect the pound to slump if the public do vote to leave the EU, so today\u2019s move suggests the Remain camp are on the front foot. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The pound was among one of the best performing currencies last week and has continued to rally this morning against the US dollar and euro as markets perceive that the recent intervention by US President Obama, as well as his possible successor Hillary Clinton has shifted the odds towards the \u201cStay \u201c camp in the latest polling indicators, dealing a blow to \u201cBrexit\u201d campaigners. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders are bracing for a busy week, with new growth data from Britain (on Wednesday), the US (Thursday) and the eurozone (on Friday). Both the eurozone and the UK are expected to have grown by just 0.4% during the first quarter of 2016, due to domestic weaknesses and the slowdown in emerging markets. And America might do even worse, with quarterly growth of just 0.15% expected. This morning, new German business confidence figure are released at 9am BST, by the IFO thinktank. It\u2019s expected to show a small improvement in business expectations, from 106.7 to 107.1. Then we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s industrial sector at 11am, from the CBI. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open mixed, after falling around 1% on Friday",

A draft approval of the agreement is being circulated among the commissioners and will likely be voted on soon. Perhaps the most immediately significant of those to consumers is that the new company will not charge usage-based prices or impose data caps on its customers for seven years. The FCC has recently received a deluge of complaints about internet data caps as the industry continues to look for ways to increase revenue in a maturing market. According to a freedom of information act review by the Wall Street Journal, the number of complaints rose to 7,904 in the second half of 2015 from 863 in the first. Other conditions will affect video pricing, as well: New Charter, as the combined company is called in its regulatory filings, won\u2019t be allowed to pass interconnection or \u201cpeering\u201d costs back to popular websites. That keeps New Charter from effectively taxing the popularity of high-traffic sites, especially video sites, by charging those sites more for the privilege of being carried at an average speed to the consumer. In a word, the deal keeps Charter from making Netflix pay an extra fee it would likely pass on to the consumer. Netflix has endorsed the deal, too. The struggle for new revenue is largely a function of a shifting focus to the web within the digital media world: cable television subscriptions are on the wane and affiliate fees from TV networks themselves are less reliable sources of continuously increasing revenue. Thus, the average cost per residential user of internet connectivity has continued to rise across the three largest cable companies in the country, according to their earnings reports. Further conditions on the merger would require that the company expand to a further two million customers and that one million of them be in an area currently served by a New Charter competitor. In a press release, Wheeler said the condition would \u201c[bring] innovation and new choices for consumers, and demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another\u201d. Charter didn\u2019t object to any of the requirements: \u201cThe conditions that will be imposed ensure Charter\u2019s current consumer-friendly and pro-broadband businesses practices will be maintained by New Charter.\u201d Many of the proposals mirror those suggested during last year\u2019s failed acquisition of Time Warner by the largest cable company in the US, Comcast. Watchers on the sidelines from analysts to activists condemned the proposed deal as anti-consumer and suggested the lead it would give Comcast over even its closest competition (Time Warner) would be extreme.

      "bodyText": "Consumer groups and MPs have criticised the government\u2019s response to the VW scandal, as a minister refused to state if the vehicle manufacturer had done anything illegal and whether British drivers should be compensated. Members of the transport select committee said the government had been \u201cphenomenally complacent\u201d and that VW lawyers would be \u201cpopping champagne corks\u201d after Robert Goodwill, the minister of state at the Department for Transport, said he had not discussed a possible prosecution. Appearing before the committee on Monday afternoon to discuss the vehicle programme testing in the light of the emissions scandal, Goodwill said that he was shocked that real world tests conducted by the DfT found that emissions of NOx were 12 times higher in a range of vehicles. Yet although Goodwill said that the testing confirmed VW had used a defeat device, the minister would not comment on whether it was illegal, claiming it was a matter for the courts. However, Goodwill said that he had not pushed for any move by the Serious Fraud Office, despite similar action abroad, including the success of the US government in reaching a settlement last week.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions, in the 13 months between the department store\u2019s sale and its collapse into administration, the Guardian has learned. Almost 11,000 jobs are at risk after BHS called in administrators on Monday, the UK\u2019s biggest high street failure since the collapse of Woolworths in 2008. Retail Acquisitions and billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, now face serious questions over their role in the 88-year-old company\u2019s downfall. MPs called for the government to launch an inquiry into the collapse of BHS, with Green\u2019s handling of the retailer labelled as the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. BHS has been left with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m, despite Green and his family collecting \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. The Pensions Regulator has confirmed that it is investigating BHS, suggesting that it is considering whether to force Green to contribute to the pension scheme. The state-backed Pension Protection Fund is already in talks to bail out the pension scheme, although this will lead to members under the age of 60 suffering a cut to their benefits of at least 10%. In addition, sources with knowledge of BHS\u2019s finances have told the Guardian that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions in the past 13 months. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. The man behind Retail Acquisitions is Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver who has been declared bankrupt twice. Chappell owns 90% of Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015. The payments include a loan of \u00a38.4m to Retail Acquisitions, taken out in March 2015, which has already been reported by the Guardian. This is part of the professional fees. About \u00a37m of the \u00a310m of interest payments is understood to have been passed on to investment firm Grovepoint for a loan taken out to support BHS. Duff &amp; Phelps has been appointed as administrator to BHS and will keep stores open as it tries to find a buyer. It insisted that staff will be paid as planned on Friday. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said in parliament that the government \u201cstands ready to offer its assistance\u201d if a buyer cannot be found. This includes helping workers to find new jobs through the Jobcentre Plus\u2019 Rapid Response Service. However, a string of MPs called for the government to investigate whether there had been any impropriety in the downfall of BHS. Referring to the conduct of Green, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cIn this situation it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill.\u201d Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP, said leaving the taxpayer to pick up the pension scheme through the PPF was the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and there were \u201creputational questions\u201d for Green to answer. The tycoon is about to take delivery of a new \u00a3100m 300ft yacht. Iain Wright, chairman of the BIS committee, said that \u201csomething is gravely wrong\u201d for the BHS pension scheme to be facing a deficit and 11,000 jobs to be at risk when Green is understood to have collected millions from the business. Soubry insisted the government would take action if it found evidence of wrongdoing. The Pensions Regulator said in a rare statement that it would look at whether it can use its \u201canti-avoidance powers\u201d to get money injected into the pension scheme, most likely from Green. The tycoon is thought to have offered to put \u00a380m into the scheme, including \u00a340m in cash and a \u00a340m loan secured against BHS assets. However, the regulator is thought to want a bigger contribution, potentially as much as \u00a3300m. A spokesperson for the regulator said: \u201cWe can confirm that we are undertaking an investigation into the BHS pensions scheme to determine whether it would be appropriate to use our anti-avoidance powers. \u201cSuch cases are complex. There is a clear process that must be followed and this can sometimes take a considerable amount of time. We are unable to provide a running commentary on case investigations, or confirm the targets of our investigation.\u201d BHS fell into administration after failing to secure the emergency funding it needed to pay rent and wages. Chappell held talks all weekend with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about the sportswear retailer buying BHS, which has 164 shops. However, the talks broke down. Sports Direct could now try to buy BHS stores from the administrators. Duff &amp; Phelps is already understood to have had more than 30 expressions of interest in buying BHS. A source close to the process said at least two of these were \u201cserious people\u201d. BHS has more than \u00a31.3bn of debts, including the pension scheme. Accountants have previously estimated that creditors would get just 1.23p for every pound if BHS collapsed, meaning landlords, clothing suppliers and staff could lose millions of pounds. Trade unions described the collapse of BHS as devastating. John Hannett, the Usdaw general secretary, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for the employees of BHS and we urge the company to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time.\u201d Green declined to comment while Chappell did not return calls or messages seeking comment on the payments. In a letter to employees on Sunday night, Chappell said: \u201cIt is with a deep heart that I have to report, despite a massive effort from the team, we have been unable to secure a funder or a trade sale. \u201cI would like to say it has been a real pleasure working with all of you on the BHS project, one I will never forget. You all need to keep your heads held high, you all have done a great job, but remember that it was always going to be very, very hard to turn around.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Sir Philip Green bought BHS in May 2000, he insisted it would not be rocket science to revive the ailing high street retailer. After paying \u00a3200m, he was convinced he had the skills to secure its future and make it the foundation of a sprawling retail empire. But last year, after failing in his mission, Green sold BHS for \u00a31 to a little known group of investors who have steered it into collapse in just over 12 months. His dreams for the chain may have come to nothing, but Green\u2019s family have still been big winners from BHS, taking out more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans to help fund a lavish lifestyle. As the pensions regulator considers whether to pursue Green for between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m \u2013 to help fill the black hole in BHS\u2019s pension schemes that had developed since 2000 \u2013 he is awaiting delivery of his latest toy: a $150m (\u00a3100m) superyacht named Lionheart. The 90-metre vessel will join Green\u2019s two other yachts, speedboat, helicopter and Gulfstream jet, which comes in handy for his weekly trips to and from Monaco to visit his family. Green and his wife Tina were listed as the UK\u2019s 29th richest family in last weekend\u2019s Sunday Times rich list, which estimated their worth as \u00a33.22bn. That total excludes the \u00a3280m which researchers suggested Greens might have to hand over to the pensions regulator. Tina, who since 2004 has been the legal owner of BHS \u2013 and the Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins \u2013 is based in Monaco. The handover of BHS to Green\u2019s wife was completed just before the family paid themselves \u00a31.2bn in dividends from Arcadia in 2005, the biggest pay cheque in British corporate history, equivalent to four times the group\u2019s then profits. Toga party Even after the financial crisis hit the UK economy in 2008, the Greens have partied on. The family enjoy several weeks a year at the exclusive Barbados resort Sandy Lane, where they can hang out with friends such as Simon Cowell. In 2012, the family apparently shelled out more than \u00a33m to fly 150 guests \u2013 including Cowell, Kate Moss, Holly Valance, and her partner, the property developer Nick Candy \u2013 to Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula for Green\u2019s 60th birthday party. Rihanna and Stevie Wonder were reportedly flown in to provide the entertainment. But that was a relatively muted affair compared to Green\u2019s 50th birthday bash, for which he chartered a private jet to fly 200 guests, including journalists and other business associates, to Cyprus for a three-day toga party at a cost of \u00a350m. Last year\u2019s birthday was rather different. Days before Green turned 63 he sold BHS, after years of trying to offload the weighty burden of the group\u2019s pension fund liabilities and trading losses. \u201cI think my birthday present was a disposal as opposed to a purchase,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. Green helped smooth through the deal by agreeing for Arcadia to pay \u00a35m a year into BHS\u2019s pension fund over three years, alongside a matching \u00a35m payment from the group\u2019s new owner, Retail Acquisitions. Arcadia also wrote off \u00a3200m of charges for BHS assets as part of the takeover deal. Arcadia initially retained a further \u00a340m of intercompany debt, but that was also written off in February. It also left \u00a365m of cash in BHS as well as about \u00a3100m of freehold and long leaseholds. On the eve of the deal, one of BHS\u2019s two head offices, next door to each other on the Marylebone Road, was sold for between \u00a330m-\u00a340m. Though the Greens had a stake in the building, they agreed that the proceeds go to BHS. Pension warning However, the pensions regulator looks likely to seek more from the Greens, as a Guardian analysis suggests the family earned more from BHS during their ownership than the retailer\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit, as measured on a buyout valuation. When Green bought BHS in May 2000, the group\u2019s fund was in surplus. In the year to March 2001, accounts filed at Companies House indicate a surplus of at least \u00a35m. A year later that had risen to \u00a317.4m on a pre-tax basis. But when pension trustees wrote to members in December last year, they warned that the company\u2019s two funds had a combined deficit of \u00a3225.6m, based on the difference between its assets and potential liabilities. Between 2002 and 2004, shareholders extracted just over \u00a3422m in dividends \u2013 the vast majority of which went to Green\u2019s family. A company controlled by Green also earned nearly \u00a310m in interest from a \u00a319.5m subordinated bond, a form of loan, issued to BHS in May 2000. The Green family also collected \u00a3151.4m in rent from 12 stores owned by a Jersey-based entity it controlled called Carmen Properties. The stores were bought for \u00a3106m in 2001 and sold for \u00a370m last year as part of the deal under which the business passed to Retail Acquisitions. The billionaire has pointed out that the deal marked a near-\u00a340m paper loss \u2013 though this was more than offset by rental income, which property experts have said was at the top end of the market rate for such stores. Meanwhile, another entity under the Green family\u2019s control, Mildenhall, collected nearly \u00a33m from ground rent on one of BHS\u2019s head offices over seven years. Even today, the family is understood to maintain ownership of BHS\u2019s Marylebone headquarters, worth about \u00a340m. If no buyer is found for the wounded retailer, the Greens could stand to benefit from the arrival of new, wealthier tenants in the sought-after central London location.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond is expected to face questions on Tuesday about his ambitions to mount an offer for the African arm of Barclays, the bank he used to run until 2012. The former Barclays chief executive, who was forced out of the bank in the wake of the Libor rigging crisis, is expected to address shareholders in his existing banking venture in Africa, Atlas Mara, when it publishes its results on Tuesday. Diamond has secured backing from the private equity firm Carlyle to help table an offer for Barclays\u2019 African operation. The business is expected to fetch about $5bn (\u00a33.5bn). The American banker is said to be aiming to mount an offer through his New York-based investment vehicle Atlas Merchant Capital, rather than Atlas Mara, which is listed on the London stock market. Barclays is understood to have some contact with Diamond about his ambitions, which would also likely require him to link up with other investors. Among those reported to be likely backers are Ashish Thakkar, founder of the Mara conglomerate \u2013 which has operations in varied business lines across Africa \u2013 and Diamond\u2019s partner in Atlas Mara. This would raise questions about the relationship with Atlas Mara, which has a stock market value of about \u00a3250m and is worth a third of what it was when it was floated in December 2013, and whether it could be subsumed into the bigger operation. The day-to-day operations of Atlas Mara are run by John Vitalo, who is a former senior executive at Barclays Africa. He is likely to end up with a key role in any enlarged business. Barclays will ask its shareholders for approval to proceed with the sale of the African business in a meeting that is being convened immediately after its annual general meeting on Thursday. In the circular to shareholders to explain why it wanted to sell Barclays Africa it said the \u201ccurrent intention of the board is to retain a meaningful stake\u201d. The chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, surprised the City by announcing last month that he wanted to scale back in Africa and reduce the 62.3% stake the bank owns in Barclays Africa Group Limited, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock market. The African operation is a complexly structured business with stakes in a number of banks, including Absa, the South African bank Barclays bought a stake in 10 years ago.

As he mentions, productivity has been in decline since before the 2008 crash, and it is clear that there is a link between low productivity and poor working conditions. It is no surprise that in Britain the flexible labour market, or race to the bottom, with zero-hours contracts, enforced self-employment and poor or non-existent pension schemes has led to lower productivity. According to the ONS, British workers produce up to 37% less per hour than French workers labouring under France\u2019s notoriously inflexible labour laws. In America the case of Costco and Walmart is even more stark. Costco\u2019s average pay is 72% higher than Walmart\u2019s, it has far more generous health and pension schemes, and yet in 2006 Costco\u2019s workers generated $21,805 operating profit per hourly employee compared with $11,615 at Walmart. As the government continues to attack trade unions and labour laws, we can expect productivity in Britain to continue to decline.

      "bodyText": "Waiting staff at the pizza chain Zizzi have had the amount they earn from tips cut, and workers will have their choice of free meals limited in changes the firm insisted were not related to the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Since 4 April, waiting staff have received 50% of tips left by customers on credit cards or through the restaurant\u2019s 12.5% service charge, with the other half shared out among kitchen staff and supervisors. Previously the split was 70/30 in favour of the front-of-house workers. Staff who qualify for a free meal have also had their choice reduced. They are now allowed to choose only a margherita pizza or a pasta with tomato sauce rather than select from a wider menu. The change came days after the implementation of the government\u2019s living wage on 1 April, which pushed up the minimum pay for workers aged over 25 by 50p an hour to \u00a37.20, and months after the restaurant group removed an 8% administration charge from staff tips. A spokesperson for the firm, which has more than 100 restaurants around the UK, said: \u201cZizzi has supported the introduction of the national living wage from the outset, underpinned by its belief that its employees are an essential part of its business who should be rewarded fairly. \u201cAs a result, Zizzi went beyond the government\u2019s requirements on 4 April by awarding additional pay rises to many of those who were already above the living wage, including chefs and managers.\u201d The firm said instead of giving free food allowances to anyone working at least a six-hour shift, it had introduced a cut-price menu for all workers. \u201cThis additional benefit results in a fairer and more equitable policy as a subsidised staff food menu with dishes at \u00a31 or \u00a32 is now available to all regardless of the length of their shift,\u201d it said. \u201cWe still provide free teas, coffee and squash to all.\u201d The chain said it was \u201cproud of our policy that ensures 100% of all tips go directly to the restaurant teams\u201d. Tips paid by credit card are distributed via a tronc system, and distribution is decided by the tronc master, who is a manager of a Zizzi restaurant, after consulting staff. The firm said the changes were designed to be \u201cmore equitable\u201d to staff. Cash tips still go to individual waiters. The abolition of the administration charge on tips followed an industry-wide campaign by unions, which resulted in the announcement of a government review into how firms deal with service charges. Dave Turnbull, regional officer at union Unite, said campaigners had been concerned about changes to tips because of the introduction of higher wages for staff. \u201cThis is one of the reasons we were pushing the business secretary to publish his report into tips before the living wage came in,\u201d he said. Businesses had warned that the new minimum wage \u2013 announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, last July \u2013 could lead to price rises and job cuts. In recent months several big high street names have made changes to staff conditions to offset some of the increase. The coffee chain Caff\u00e8 Nero recently cut free food for staff, while Waitrose and B&amp;Q have stopped paying Sunday overtime to some workers. Last week, the chancellor said companies who made changes to staff perks were not acting in \u201cthe spirit of the law\u201d. Cleaners at Nationwide building society have, however, received good news on pay. The GMB union said it had called off a ballot for strike action after Carillion, the firm employing cleaning staff at the society\u2019s headquarters, told them they would not have to adopt new shift patterns that would have resulted in a \u00a340-a-week pay cut. The society pays the hourly rate of \u00a38.25 set by the Living Wage Foundation but proposed changes meant they would have worked fewer hours and at more antisocial times.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sympathy for BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff deepens when you read how Dominic Chappell, the boss of its owner Retail Acquisitions, finished his farewell email to staff. \u201cI would like to say it has been a real pleasure working with all of you on the BHS project, one I will never forget,\u201d he writes, crassly missing the required tone. No, Mr Chappell, BHS was never a \u201cproject\u201d for the staff. It is how they earned their living and made plans to fund their retirement. On one point, though, Chappell was correct. BHS was \u201calways going to be very, very hard to turn around\u201d. It is an underinvested, loss-making chain in a corner of a tough retail market where the death of the department store was being debated even before internet shopping arrived. Dutch-owned C&amp;A, remember, pulled out of the UK as long ago as 2000; it would be hard to say it was mourned for long. But given the odds against the BHS \u201cproject\u201d succeeding, there is an urgent question. How much responsibility for the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund lies with Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell and his inexperienced crew for \u00a31 a year ago. The answer is clearly not none. The principle is clear: former owners cannot wash their hands of a pensions problem simply by selling a business for a token sum. Even Green implicitly acknowledged as much when he offered the Pension Protection Fund a \u00a340m contribution plus a write-off of a \u00a340m loan. However, \u00a380m is plainly inadequate in the context of a \u00a3571m deficit. It also looks like small change when you recall that Green \u2013 or, strictly speaking, his wife \u2013 took \u00a3400m in dividends out of BHS in happier times. The Greens might argue that it was long time ago, and that the failure of BHS \u2013 at the point of sale last year \u2013 was not inevitable. Green anticipated the question at the time by insisting that the sale was 100% clean. \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d he asked. But it\u2019s not that simple. BHS\u2019s fitness to fly was influenced, to some degree, by decisions taken under Green\u2019s ownership. That\u2019s not just about dividends. Property transactions and the plan to address the pensions deficit after the 2012 triennial review are also relevant. There is also, to follow Green\u2019s metaphor, the small matter of who you entrust with a plane carrying 11,000 staff and 20,000 pensioners. Chappell was formerly bankrupt. In trying to rewire BHS, he was attempting a task that had defeated Green. Nobody should be surprised that Retail Acquisitions failed to secure the necessary finance. For all those reasons, the Pensions Regulator should put the maximum squeeze on Green, if necessary. The Pension Protection Fund is paid for by a levy on other final salary schemes, so any shortfall would rebound elsewhere. Indeed, the credibility of a scheme born as a reaction to past scandals such as Robert Maxwell depends on the outcome at BHS being seen as fair and reasonable. What that means in terms of hard sums can only be described once the administrator has gone to work and a precise pension shortfall can be defined. In the meantime, however, recall Green\u2019s farewell message when he sold the business. \u201cI am deeply proud of the work ethic displayed by the very many people I have worked with for so long at BHS, both within our head office and across the stores,\u201d he said. He now has a chance to express his gratitude in more than words. Prepare to dig deep, Sir Philip: forget Topshop, the yachts (a new 300-footer is on the way), the fashion academy and the knighthood. Your contribution to retailing will be remembered chiefly by the decency, or otherwise, of your behaviour towards BHS pensioners. Saudi Arabia will do well to end its \u2018addiction\u2019 to oil The first step towards overcoming an addiction, they say, is recognition that there\u2019s a problem. In Saudi Arabia\u2019s case, the malaise is obvious \u2013 the huge budget deficit that has followed the fall in the oil price. Ending the \u201caddiction\u201d to oil, as asserted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would have been a better idea a few years ago when the oil price was higher, but there\u2019s no time like the present. One difficulty lies in believing that the transformation can be achieved quickly: the deputy crown prince even talked about four years. Less than 5% of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, will be sold initially, so this is a strategy in cutting down, rather than quitting abruptly. Given that Aramco could be worth $2tn (\u00a31.38tn), that\u2019s probably the only viable approach. The hardest part, though, may be meeting buyers\u2019 expectations for transparent information. A \u201cnormal\u201d oil company is expected to publish an audited profile of its reserves. Is Saudi Arabia really prepared to display information currently regarded as a state secret?",

Dutch-owned C&amp;A, remember, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/15/2\">pulled out of the UK</a> as long ago as 2000; it would be hard to say it was mourned for long.</p> <p>But given the odds against the BHS \u201cproject\u201d succeeding, there is an urgent question. How much responsibility for the \u00a3571m deficit in the pension fund lies with Sir Philip Green, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">sold BHS to Chappell</a> and his inexperienced crew for \u00a31 a year ago.</p> <p>The answer is clearly not none. The principle is clear: former owners cannot wash their hands of a pensions problem simply by selling a business for a token sum. Even Green implicitly acknowledged as much when he offered the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/pension-protection-fund-bhs-retirement-ppf\">Pension Protection Fund</a> a \u00a340m contribution plus a write-off of a \u00a340m loan.</p> <p>However, \u00a380m is plainly inadequate in the context of a \u00a3571m deficit. It also looks like small change when you recall that Green \u2013 or, strictly speaking, his wife \u2013 took \u00a3400m in dividends out of BHS in happier times.</p> <p>The Greens might argue that it was long time ago, and that the failure of BHS \u2013 at the point of sale last year \u2013 was not inevitable. Green anticipated the question at the time by insisting that the sale was 100% clean. \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not that simple. BHS\u2019s fitness to fly was influenced, to some degree, by decisions taken under Green\u2019s ownership. That\u2019s not just about dividends. Property transactions and the plan to address the pensions deficit after the 2012 triennial review are also relevant.</p> <p>There is also, to follow Green\u2019s metaphor, the small matter of who you entrust with a plane carrying 11,000 staff and 20,000 pensioners. Chappell was formerly bankrupt. In trying to rewire BHS, he was attempting a task that had defeated Green. Nobody should be surprised that Retail Acquisitions failed to secure the necessary finance.</p> <p>For all those reasons, the Pensions Regulator should put the maximum squeeze on Green, if necessary. The Pension Protection Fund is paid for by a levy on other final salary schemes, so any shortfall would rebound elsewhere. Indeed, the credibility of a scheme born as a reaction to past scandals such as Robert Maxwell depends on the outcome at BHS being seen as fair and reasonable.</p> <p>What that means in terms of hard sums can only be described once the administrator has gone to work and a precise pension shortfall can be defined. In the meantime, however, recall Green\u2019s farewell message when he sold the business. \u201cI am deeply proud of the work ethic displayed by the very many people I have worked with for so long at BHS, both within our head office and across the stores,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/bhs-zip/giv-12515nn8ByEFoWjbE/\" data-alt=\"BHS pension fund\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/04/bhs-zip/giv-12515nn8ByEFoWjbE/\">BHS pension fund</a> <figcaption>BHS pension fund.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He now has a chance to express his gratitude in more than words. Prepare to dig deep, Sir Philip: forget Topshop, the yachts (a new 300-footer is on the way), the fashion academy and the knighthood. Your contribution to retailing will be remembered chiefly by the decency, or otherwise, of your behaviour towards BHS pensioners.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia will do well to end its \u2018addiction\u2019 to oil</h2> <p>The first step towards overcoming an addiction, they say, is recognition that there\u2019s a problem. In Saudi Arabia\u2019s case, the malaise is obvious \u2013 the huge budget deficit that has followed the fall in the oil price. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/saudi-arabia-approves-ambitious-plan-to-move-economy-beyond-oil\">Ending the \u201caddiction\u201d</a> to oil, as asserted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would have been a better idea a few years ago when the oil price was higher, but there\u2019s no time like the present.</p> <p>One difficulty lies in believing that the transformation can be achieved quickly: the deputy crown prince even talked about four years. Less than 5% of Saudi Aramco, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/16/saudi-aramco-10-trillion-dollar-mystery-heart-of-gulf-state\">the state oil company</a>, will be sold initially, so this is a strategy in cutting down, rather than quitting abruptly. Given that Aramco could be worth $2tn (\u00a31.38tn), that\u2019s probably the only viable approach.</p> <p>The hardest part, though, may be meeting buyers\u2019 expectations for transparent information. A \u201cnormal\u201d oil company is expected to publish an audited profile of its reserves. Is Saudi Arabia really prepared to display information currently regarded as a state secret? </p>",

      "bodyText": "What is the Pension Protection Fund? Officially, it\u2019s a government-sponsored lifeboat for collapsed pension schemes, but it is seen by some as a dumping ground for tycoons shaking off their liabilities. Now a decade old, it provides cover for 11 million workers with final salary-style pension schemes. So far it has bailed out 800 failed schemes with 222,000 members, at a cost of \u00a31.8bn. So taxpayers are on the hook for the \u00a3571m hole in BHS\u2019s pension scheme? Not really. Bailouts are paid for by a levy on all businesses that still have these pension schemes, not the taxpayer. Last year the PPF told companies to cough up \u00a3574m to put into the rescue pot. Only if the PPF itself failed would taxpayers probably have to pick up the tab. So I run a small business and have to subsidise yachts in Monaco? Arguably, yes. Many business owners are hopping mad at how much they have to pay into the PPF. For example, Sussex-based Southern Testing provides ground testing services for construction companies, and has a \u00a35m turnover. Last year its PPF levy tripled to \u00a325,000, equal to a quarter of the total bill for providing pensions to its workers, and more than its corporation tax bill. Its boss, Morris Stevenson, accuses other companies of dumping liabilities on to the PPF and is angry he may have to pick up part of the bill for the failure of BHS. Might BHS sink the protection fund? Unlikely. BHS\u2019s pension deficit is only the sixth or seventh largest to go into the pensions lifeboat in terms of value, although with 20,000 workers affected, it is in the top five in terms of the number of people. The PPF is financially healthy, having built up a large surplus in recent years. In 2014-15 the surplus was \u00a34.8bn, making BHS affordable for now. What\u2019s more, the way the PPF calculates liabilities means the bailout is likely to be closer to \u00a3200m to \u00a3300m, not the \u00a3571m quoted as the \u201chole\u201d in the BHS fund. Can they go after former boss Sir Philip Green for the money? Yes, but whether they will have any success is another matter. The pensions regulator said it was \u201cundertaking an investigation into the BHS pensions scheme to determine whether it would be appropriate to use our anti-avoidance powers\u201d. It has legal powers to pursue those \u201cdeliberately attempting to avoid their pension obligations\u201d. But it will inevitably involve lengthy court actions. In 2014, after a six-year legal battle, the pensions regulator won a \u00a3184m case involving nearly 2,500 former Lehman Brothers bankers based in the UK. But a legal battle with ITV over the \u00a362m deficit of Boxclever, the TV rental firm, continues 13 years after the company went bust. What will BHS workers actually get? The bad news for the thousands of current and former BHS employees under retirement age is that they will have their pension entitlements cut. What\u2019s more, the PPF offers limited protection against inflation, and this will particularly affect BHS \u201clifers\u201d (see later). BHS workers will receive \u201ccompensation\u201d based on 90% of what their pension was worth at the time it became insolvent \u2013 ie they will lose 10%. The maximum they can receive is also capped. These caps vary depending on the recipient\u2019s age and are recalculated every year. For example, as of 1 April 2016, the most someone aged 65 can get is \u00a333,678 per year. Entitlements rise in line with inflation each year \u2013 again subject to a cap. What about anyone who retired early? They will generally receive 90% of their entitlement based on what their pension was worth at the time. The earlier someone retired, the lower the annual cap is set, \u201cto compensate for the longer time you will be receiving payments\u201d, said the PPF. What about retired BHS workers already receiving pensions? They should get their full pension with no deductions. \u201cWe will also generally pay 100% compensation to those who have retired on legitimate ill-health grounds, regardless of age, and those receiving a pension in relation to someone who had died at the time that the employer went bust,\u201d says the PPF. Future inflation-linked rises are capped at a maximum of 2.5% a year. What about the new freedoms on pensions that took effect a year ago? The changes introduced in April 2015 do not apply to the PPF. Members will still receive a regular payment from the organisation rather than a lump sum.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group is proposing to cut political donations by a quarter in a move that could signify a scaling back of support for the Co-operative party, a Labour-aligned political group that backs MPs including the shadow health minister, Luciana Berger, and the shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell. The Co-op board has sought approval for political donations or subscriptions to be capped at \u00a3750,000 \u2013 down from the \u00a31m approved last year \u2013 in a motion to be voted on by the mutual\u2019s millions of members at its annual meeting next month. The change - which could be reversed in the future - comes after a complex three-part motion tabled by the board on whether to keep political donations failed at last year\u2019s annual meeting. The group\u2019s board says it has already agreed funding of \u00a3625,600 in both 2016 and 2017 for the Co-operative party. If the motion is accepted, the Co-op will continue that support and make donations to other political parties, campaigns and organisations that \u201csupport co-operative values and principles during 2017\u201d. Approval could mark the first time the Co-op channels funds to other parties. If the motion is not passed then the mutual said it would terminate funding for the Co-operative party at the end of 2017. At the meeting, members will also get to vote on the multimillion-pound pay deals for the Co-op\u2019s management including pay and potential bonuses of just over \u00a33m this year for the chief executive, Richard Pennycook, ahead of a substantial cut in his pay in 2017. In a significant protest vote, more than one in three of the votes cast at the AGM rejected the pay report last year. Another motion, put forward by members of some of the 120 independent co-operative societies associated with the main Co-op Group, calls for management to review the range of Fairtrade products available and rebuild the range. The motion says that while the Co-op has moved to 100% Fairtrade sugar and moved all its Easter eggs to the ethical mark, it has dropped other Fairtrade products including honey, cashew nuts, cotton wool and muesli. The board said only eight lines have been dropped accounting for less than 1% of products sold and that it was instead focusing on improving its range of more mainstream products including tea, coffee and wine. In a bid to encourage more members to take part, the mutual has pledged to donate 50p for every vote pledged to its joint anti-loneliness campaign with the British Red Cross. The Co-op only introduced a one-member-one-vote system last year as a replacement for the block vote method of the past. Allan Leighton, the Co-op chairman said: \u201cThe Co-op is so much more than a commercial business, and while I\u2019m greatly encouraged by our current trading performance, it\u2019s essential that our wider Co-op difference also shines brightly once more. To do this we need to build engagement among our millions of members so that our purpose can be felt throughout communities across the UK.\u201d",

In a significant protest vote, more than one in three of the votes cast at the AGM rejected the pay report last year.</p> <p>Another motion, put forward by members of some of the 120 independent co-operative societies associated with the main Co-op Group, calls for management to review the range of Fairtrade products available and rebuild the range.</p> <p>The motion says that while the Co-op has moved to 100% Fairtrade sugar and moved all its Easter eggs to the ethical mark, it has dropped other Fairtrade products including honey, cashew nuts, cotton wool and muesli.</p> <p>The board said only eight lines have been dropped accounting for less than 1% of products sold and that it was instead focusing on improving its range of more mainstream products including tea, coffee and wine.</p> <p>In a bid to encourage more members to take part, the mutual has pledged to donate 50p for every vote pledged to its joint anti-loneliness campaign with the British Red Cross. The Co-op only introduced a one-member-one-vote system last year as a replacement for the block vote method of the past.</p> <p>Allan Leighton, the Co-op chairman said: \u201cThe Co-op is so much more than a commercial business, and while I\u2019m greatly encouraged by our current trading performance, it\u2019s essential that our wider Co-op difference also shines brightly once more. To do this we need to build engagement among our millions of members so that our purpose can be felt throughout communities across the UK.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among West End shoppers there was widespread dismay at news of BHS\u2019s financial collapse on Monday. But even the retailer\u2019s fans felt it had failed to move with the times. Some older people felt the 88-year-old chain was the only store left on the high street that catered for them, but younger shoppers\u2019 only memories of it were visits with grandma. The Oxford Street store seemed to be attracting some interest with plenty of shoppers going through its swing doors. Few, however, emerged with any purchases.

She was worried she might not be able to exchange an unwanted item. \u201cI think the problem with BHS is that this branch is very up to date, but if you go to the branch in Surrey Quays it\u2019s as if you have gone back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone back to the mid-90s.\u201d For others, that dated look was the main attraction.

Marks and Spencer are too upmarket now, all it is is business suits and business blouses and they are totally out of touch with people like me. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real shame because John Lewis and Debenhams are too expensive now. Primark\u2019s quality is not that great, plus they are more for the younger generation.

    "webTitle": "Dominic Chappell and the BHS takeover that alarmed retail watchers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The career path that led Dominic Chappell to take over of one of the best known names on the British high street was unconventional. The 49-year-old racing driver-turned-entrepreneur had no experience of retailing before leading the consortium that bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. Nor did the details of his previous business ventures overwhelm observers with confidence that Chappell could turn BHS around. Chappell, who owns 90% of the shares in BHS\u2019s owner, Retail Acquisitions, has been involved in a number of failed businesses including the Island Harbour development in the Isle of Wight and has twice been declared bankrupt. He had also backed business turnarounds, according to a spokesman last year, including a Spanish oil distribution company called Olivia Petroleum. However, those in the City who were sceptical about the experience of the previously low-profile Chappell will now argue their doubts were well placed. As BHS struggled, Chappell paid himself a salary of almost \u00a3540,000, while reportedly buying a new yacht and loaning his father \u00a31.3m to pay off the mortgage on a home. Meanwhile, Retail Acquisitions has taken millions out of BHS since acquiring the retailer. When BHS sold its Oxford Street store for \u00a355m and its Sunderland brand for \u00a32.2m last month, the proceeds were to be part of its \u00a3100m financial restructuring package. However, \u00a3600,000 of the Oxford Street deal and \u00a3440,000 from the Sunderland deal went to Retail Acquisitions. The consortium said the payments were in accordance with the management services agreement between BHS and Retail Acquisitions. It also emerged last month that \u00a33m of an \u00a38.4m loan taken out of BHS by its owners last year went to the four Retail Acquisitions directors. Much of which chimes with fears that many retail watchers had for BHS when Retail Acquisitions took over last year. What was not being spun at the time was that during 2014 Chappell was briefly a director of a company understood to be controlled by Paul Sutton, a 59-year-old bankrupt businessman who was found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002 and was sentenced to three years imprisonment in a case unconnected with Chappell. The reason why Chappell\u2019s link to Sutton was interesting, though, was that Sutton had also been in negotiations with Green during 2013 and 2014 about acquiring BHS and had met with the tycoon\u2019s finance director, Paul Budge, at the group\u2019s London headquarters. The talks were sufficiently serious for Sutton to have signed a non-disclosure agreement with BHS, allowing him to gain privileged access to the retailer\u2019s books. At the time, when asked by the Guardian if he had seen Sutton\u2019s BHS business plan, Chappell said: \u201cI have no comment on that because I was bound by confidentiality to him at that stage.\u201d Both Retail Acquisitions and Sutton denied they were in any way connected on the eventual deal to buy BHS. When asked in April 2015 if he had any further financial dealings with Sutton in the 12 months preceding the BHS takeover, Chappell told the Guardian: \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d On being pressed, he added: \u201cI might have transferred some money over to a landlord of his [Sutton\u2019s] when he got himself into financial difficulties about a year ago, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d He later said he paid \u201ca few bills 12 months ago\u201d on Sutton\u2019s behalf. Chappell, who said he first met Sutton in around 2006 when Sutton briefly tried to buy property from him, also said: \u201cWhat I am telling you very clearly is that I\u2019m nothing to do with Paul Sutton, I\u2019m not associated with him, I have no further business with him whatsoever. It was a very small snapshot in time that I dealt with him and I realised that he was not the person that he thought he was.\u201d Last month, the Sunday Times revealed that Chappell and Sutton had set up a secret company in Panama less than a month after Retail Acquisitions acquired BHS. The pair owned 50% of Clarberry, which was incorporated in the tax haven on 1 April last year. Chappell did not return the Guardian\u2019s calls on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Small businesses alleging that Royal Bank of Scotland drove them to the wall for its own profit are to lodge claims worth more than \u00a31bn against the bailed-out bank after securing legal and financial backing. RGL Management, formed to gather claims against RBS over the conduct of its now defunct Global Restructuring Group, is understood to have processed 50 claimants less than a month after its launch. The group has also secured legal representation from Humphries Kerstetter, which has previously acted for Tesco and WH Smith in a suit against credit card companies. Claims within RGL Management are expected to exceed \u00a31bn as the group prepares for a marketing push to sign up more firms. \u201cWe believe this has the potential to be a huge claim,\u201d said James Hayward, its chief executive. \u201cSingle businesses within our group have losses of tens of millions of pounds and thousands of businesses suffered as a result of GRG\u2019s actions. The rate at which we are being contacted by businesses suggests our claim will be very significant.\u201d Legal action against RBS is gathering pace even as City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority prepares to publish its report into the GRG unit, set up to help struggling businesses. The allegations about GRG gained publicity in 2013 when a former government adviser, Lawrence Tomlinson, published a report arguing the RBS division drove clients to the brink so the bank could buy their properties and make a profit. An FCA report on Tomlinson\u2019s accusation is expected to be published within weeks. RGL Management said it was looking to swell the ranks of former GRG clients seeking redress before a courtroom fight that was likely to be met by a fierce defence from RBS. \u201cThis is about making people realise that there is a vehicle through which they can claim,\u201d said Hayward. \u201cWe are funded, we have lawyers ready, we\u2019re investigating and processing data and if people think they have an issue they should come and talk to us.\u201d RGL will use funds provided by professional litigation investors to seek fresh evidence from whistleblowers and through other investigative means. RBS, which is scheduled to publish its quarterly results this week, said it would defend the claims. \u201cWe believe we have a strong case and will defend these claims vigorously,\u201d a spokesperson said. One claimant, Nigel Henderson, said RBS pushed his hotel business into bankruptcy. He claims the bank would not let him pay off a mortgage on a hotel he owned with the \u00a3800,000 proceeds from a previous hotel sale. Henderson says GRG told him to pay \u00a3240,000 to extricate himself from the mortgage but would not then let him use the \u00a3800,000 to do so. RBS\u2019s alleged refusal to cooperate left him saddled with huge mortgage payments that meant he was unable to continue doing business, he claims. The bank eventually petitioned for his bankruptcy and Henderson is claiming for losses \u201cin the millions\u201d of pounds. \u201cThey took everything from us, including our house. We were evicted,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened to us and thousands of other people is a travesty of justice and symptomatic of the greed displayed by the senior management of RBS, who had no interest in anything other than self-aggrandisement.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BHS collapses into administration as rescue deal fails", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BHS has officially collapsed into administration after failing to agree a last-minute deal to rescue the department store chain. The demise of the retailer, which employs 11,000 people, is the biggest failure on the high street since that of Woolworths in 2008. Duff &amp; Phelps has been appointed as administrators and will keep stores open as it tries to find a buyer for BHS. The government is expected to make a statement on the failure of the 88-year-old retail group in parliament this afternoon, either through Sajid Javid, the business secretary, or Anna Soubry, the business minister. The Pensions Regulator has confirmed that it is investigating BHS, suggesting that the regulator is considering whether to force Sir Philip Green, the former owner of the retailer, to contribute towards the company\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit. In a statement, Duff &amp; Phelps said: \u201cThe group has been undergoing restructuring and, as has been widely reported, the shareholders have been in negotiations to find a buyer for the business. These negotiations have been unsuccessful. In addition, property sales have not materialised as expected in both number and value. \u201cConsequently, as a result of a lower than expected cash balance, the group is very unlikely to meet all contractual payments. The directors therefore have no alternative but to put the group into administration to protect it for all creditors. The group will continue to trade as usual whilst the administrators seek to sell it as a going concern. Further announcements will be made as appropriate in due course.\u201d Duff &amp; Phelps was understood to have had more than 30 expressions of interest in buying BHS by midday on Monday. The collapse of BHS presents another problem for the government as it attempts to save thousands of jobs in the steel industry. The retailer had failed to secure the emergency funding that it needed to pay wages and rent. Javid said the government was in talks with BHS management about the retailer\u2019s collapse. Dominic Chappell, the owner of BHS, said in a letter to employees on Sunday night: \u201cIt is with a deep heart that I have to report, despite a massive effort from the team, we have been unable to secure a funder or a trade sale.\u201d He indicated in the letter that staff wages for this month would be paid by the administrators. Chappell led the Retail Acquisitions consortium that bought BHS from Green for \u00a31 last year. However, the retailer has struggled with falling sales, a hefty rent bill and a pensions deficit. In a rare public statement, the Pensions Regulator said it is investigating BHS\u2019s pension deficit amid calls for Green to contribute towards to the scheme. \u201cWe can confirm that we are undertaking an investigation into the BHS pensions scheme to determine whether it would be appropriate to use our anti-avoidance powers,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cSuch cases are complex. There is a clear process that must be followed and this can sometimes take a considerable amount of time. We are unable to provide a running commentary on case investigations or confirm the targets of our investigation.\u201d Green has already held talks with the Pensions Regulator about injecting cash into the company\u2019s pension scheme. He is thought to have offered \u00a340m in cash and a \u00a340m loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets. Trade unions described the collapse of BHS as devastating. John Hannett, the Usdaw general secretary, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for the employees of BHS and we urge the company to change their attitude to trade unions and begin a dialogue with us at this difficult and worrying time. \u201cWe also urge the administrators and the company to comply with the law, consult with staff and Usdaw as the union for BHS workers. We don\u2019t want to see BHS staff locked out of discussions, sent to the back of the queue of creditors and treated like fixtures and fittings, as happened at Woolworth\u2019s. \u201cThe government needs to intervene now to protect taxpayers from picking up the bill for redundancy payments and safeguard the Pension Protection Fund. \u201cWe are in touch with our members working in BHS to reassure them that we will provide the support, advice and representation they require.\u201d At the retailer\u2019s store in Oxford Street, central London, customers were waiting outside before it opened as usual. Nicolette Kadzeya, 39, who was there with her three children, was looking to exchange an unwanted item. \u201cI think the problem with BHS is that this branch is very up to date, but if you go to the branch in Surrey Quays, it\u2019s as if you have gone back in time. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve gone back to the mid-90s,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the branches which are outside London are not that well maintained. It\u2019s a bit old fashioned as well. They are good for school shoes but it\u2019s not really up to date.\u201d The demise of BHS comes a month after the retailer appeared to have secured its short-term survival by persuading landlords to cut its rent by up to 75% at 87 shops. However, even as landlords, suppliers and creditors voted overwhelmingly in favour of the survival plan, known as a company voluntary arrangement, BHS warned that it needed to find \u00a3100m to continue trading. It attempted to raise the money with \u00a330m of property sales, a new \u00a360m loan from private equity firm Gordon Brothers and \u00a310m from changing the terms of its agreement with suppliers. On top of this, it needed to bring in another \u00a370m from selling property to pay off a separate loan from Grovepoint. But it failed to raise enough cash from property sales and the deal with Gordon Brothers fell apart. Talks with the private equity firm were already complex, because Green needed to release security that he held over BHS\u2019s assets for the loan to go through. Green, who bought BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000, is understood to have been ready to agree to the loan, but the funds from Gordon Brothers were not enough without the property deals, and the strict terms led to the talks collapsing. Talks over the weekend with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct also appear to have come to nothing. BHS\u2019s chief executive, Darren Topp, said on Sunday that \u00a360m needed to be found urgently to keep the company afloat. \u201cWhat was on the table wasn\u2019t sufficient and we have been working in the last few days to fill the gap,\u201d he said.",

On top of this, it needed to bring in another \u00a370m from selling property to pay off a separate loan from Grovepoint.</p> <p>But it failed to raise enough cash from property sales and the deal with Gordon Brothers fell apart.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers managed to nudge up their production in the past three months and they are optimistic that domestic and overseas demand will improve, according to an industry survey. The business lobby group CBI said its quarterly survey of factory bosses found that more reported a rise in output than a fall in the three months to April, marking the strongest performance since last July for the sector. But while the 472 manufacturers surveyed were upbeat about future demand, the past three months had been tough, with export orders falling again. Factory output has been hit in recent months by a slowdown in global trade as well as a slump in demand for manufacturers\u2019 wares from the struggling North Sea oil and gas industry. Steel plant closures have added to the woes of the manufacturing sector and thousands of job losses are expected this year. A sluggish manufacturing sector and volatile trade in the construction industry mean that consumers have been left to drive economic growth. Economists expect that pattern to be confirmed in Wednesday\u2019s publication of first quarter GDP figures. Economic growth is forecast to have slowed to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final months of 2015, according to a Reuters poll. The CBI said despite some glimmers of light in its survey, including a pick-up in employment over the past three months, the outlook remained challenging for manufacturers. \u201cManufacturing has yet to pick up after a flat start to the year, with falling orders providing little impetus for production. While expectations for the upcoming quarter are encouraging, manufacturers are still facing sizable external headwinds,\u201d said CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith. There has been some support for UK exporters from a weaker pound, which has dipped on worries about June\u2019s EU referendum resulting in a vote to leave the bloc. That makes UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers but at the same time it raises some manufacturers\u2019 costs by making imported materials more expensive. \u201cThe falling exchange rate should give some support to manufacturers, and investment intentions are strong,\u201d added Newton-Smith. The survey showed total new orders edged down in the three months to April, matching the pace of decline in the previous quarter. The latest deterioration was driven by a dip in export orders, while domestic orders were broadly flat. But asked about the coming three months, more manufacturers expected a rise than a fall in both output and demand. The CBI uses balances to gauge activity, demand and sentiment at manufacturing businesses. The balance for output edged into positive territory for the past three months, as 24% of businesses reported a rise in volumes, and 23% a decrease. That resulting balance of +1% compared with -2% in the three months to January. The orders balance was steady at -4%. For April alone, the orders balance improved to -11% from -14% in March. Looking to the year ahead, manufacturers\u2019 plans for investment in buildings, and in plant and machinery were at \u201crobust levels\u201d, the CBI said. Those intentions contrast with other reports that businesses are delaying spending and hiring plans until after June\u2019s EU referendum. Those signs of caution have prompted the Bank of England to warn that economic growth could lose momentum over coming months. Commenting on the CBI survey, Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cIn contrast to the message from other surveys, Brexit risk also does not appear to be dissuading investment. \u201cIt is too soon to conclude, however, that the manufacturing sector is out of the woods. Sterling will bounce back if, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU in June. Meanwhile, the domestic market for manufactured goods likely will remain weak as growth in consumers\u2019 real income slows in response to rising inflation and intensifying austerity.\u201d",

But asked about the coming three months, more manufacturers expected a rise than a fall in both output and demand.</p> <p>The CBI uses balances to gauge activity, demand and sentiment at manufacturing businesses. The balance for output edged into positive territory for the past three months, as 24% of businesses reported a rise in volumes, and 23% a decrease. That resulting balance of +1% compared with -2% in the three months to January. The orders balance was steady at -4%.</p> <p>For April alone, the orders balance improved to -11% from -14% in March. </p> <p>Looking to the year ahead, manufacturers\u2019 plans for investment in buildings, and in plant and machinery were at \u201crobust levels\u201d, the CBI said. <br></p> <p>Those intentions contrast with other reports that businesses are delaying spending and hiring plans until after June\u2019s EU referendum. Those signs of caution have prompted the Bank of England to warn that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bank-of-england-warns-brexit-could-do-serious-harm-to-uk-economy\">economic growth could lose momentum over coming months</a>.</p> <p>Commenting on the CBI survey, Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cIn contrast to the message from other surveys, Brexit risk also does not appear to be dissuading investment.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too soon to conclude, however, that the manufacturing sector is out of the woods. Sterling will bounce back if, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU in June. Meanwhile, the domestic market for manufactured goods likely will remain weak as growth in consumers\u2019 real income slows in response to rising inflation and intensifying austerity.\u201d</p>",

GVC, which already owned the Sportingbet brand, said profits fell to \u20ac25.5m (\u00a319.8m) after a \u20ac23m charge related to the purchase of bwin, the group behind PartyPoker. The charge mainly comprised legal and professional fees, plus the cost of a euro/pound hedge. GVC fought off a rival offer for bwin from 888 Holdings. The figures include no contribution from bwin since the deal was completed in February, two months after GVC\u2019s year end. But on a standalone basis bwin lost \u20ac42.3m in 2015. Both GVC and bwin were hit by the point of sale consumption tax introduced on UK gaming revenues \u2013 a 15% levy no matter where bets are placed in the world \u2013 and by VAT imposed by the EU. Since its year end, GVC said revenue per day had risen 13% for the combined group, with GVC brands up 18% and bwin up 11%. PartyPoker recorded its first year-on-year quarterly growth for five years. GVC\u2019s chief executive, Kenny Alexander, said: \u201cThe bwin.party acquisition in early 2016 affords us an opportunity to take the group to the next level. GVC has never been in a stronger position going forward. The enlarged group is already enjoying encouraging trading \u2026 There is much work to be done [but] with GVC and bwin.party brands growing, together with synergy benefits, we look forward with confidence to another successful year.\u201d Alexander said the positive start to the year reflected the fact that bwin\u2019s business was beginning to stabilise and return to growth after a number of difficult years.\u201cI have visited all the key [bwin] operations and am very encouraged by what I have seen,\u201d he added. Banking and asset management firm Investec, issued a buy note for GVC and raised its target price from 545p to 592p. Investec analyst Alistair Ross said : \u201cGVC management has already started to reorganise bwin, product improvements are underway and the group is confident of realising \u20ac125m of synergies in 2018. Pro-forma results to the 20 April are ahead of our expectations and we have upgraded our forecasts to reflect stronger growth.\u201d GVC\u2019s shares jumped nearly 5% to 548.5p.",

      "bodyText": "There aren\u2019t many things upon which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree, especially as they court very different Delaware voters ahead of a primary on Tuesday. But the candidates for president share an affinity for the same nondescript two-storey office building in Wilmington. A building that has become famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax through the so-called \u201cDelaware loophole\u201d. The receptionist at 1209 North Orange Street isn\u2019t surprised that a journalist has turned up unannounced on a sunny weekday afternoon. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t speak to you,\u201d she says. A yellow post-it note on her computer screen reads \u201cMEDIA: Chuck Miller\u201d with the phone number of the company\u2019s director of corporate communications. Miller can\u2019t answer many questions either, except to say that the company does not advise clients on their tax affairs. The Guardian is not the first media organisation to turn up at the offices of Corporation Trust Centre, and it\u2019s unlikely to be the last. This squat, yellow brick office building just north of Wilmington\u2019s rundown downtown is the registered address of more than 285,000 companies. That\u2019s more than any other known address in the world, and 15 times more than the 18,000 registered in Ugland House, a five-storey building in the Cayman Islands that Barack Obama called \u201ceither the biggest building in the world, or the biggest tax scam on record\u201d. Officially, 1209 North Orange is home to Apple, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, Walmart and dozens of other companies in the Fortune 500 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. Being registered in Delaware lets companies take advantage of strict corporate secrecy rules, business-friendly courts and the \u201cDelaware loophole\u201d, which can allow companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of the state. The loophole is said to have cost other states more than $9bn in lost taxes over the past decade and led to Delaware to be described as \u201cone of the world\u2019s biggest havens for tax avoidance and evasion\u201d. But it\u2019s not just big corporations that have chosen to make 1209 North Orange their official home. Both the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why. Clinton, who has repeatedly promised that as president she will crack down on \u201coutrageous tax havens and loopholes that super-rich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere\u201d, collected more than $16m in public speaking fees and book royalties in 2014 through the doors of 1209, according to the Clintons\u2019 tax return. Just eight days after stepping down as secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton registered ZFS Holdings LLC at CTC\u2019s offices. Bill Clinton set up WJC LLC, a vehicle to collect his consultation fees, at the same address in 2008. A spokesman for Clinton said: \u201cZFS was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\u201d The Clintons\u2019 companies share the office with several of Trump\u2019s companies. They include Trump International Management Corp and several companies that form part of Hudson Waterfront Associates, a Trump partnership to develop more than $1bn worth of luxury condos on the west side of Manhattan. Of the 515 companies on Trump\u2019s official Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing, 378 are registered in Delaware, he revealed, after being questioned by the Guardian about why so many of his New York-based companies are incorporated in Delaware. He said he asked his staff to find out how many entities he has in Delaware. \u201cI figured they\u2019d maybe say two or three, right?\u201d Trump said at a rally in Harrington, Delaware, on Friday. \u201cWe have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware, meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don\u2019t feel at all guilty, OK?\u201d Among them are 40 Wall Street Corporation, Trump\u2019s 72-storey downtown tower that was the tallest building in the world for two months in 1930, and the Trump Carousel in Central Park. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether Trump was using Delaware in order to avoid taxes in New York. It is not unusual for rich individuals and companies to register their business in Delaware due to the ease of company formation in the state, but the Clintons\u2019 and Trump\u2019s companies in the state are likely to come under greater scrutiny as the US presidential primary roadshow rolls into the state on Tuesday. A poll by research firm Gravis Marketing last week showed Trump had a 37-point lead over John Kasich; Clinton polled 45%, ahead of Sanders on 38% in the same poll. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, titled Delaware: An Onshore Tax Haven, said the state\u2019s tax code made it \u201ca magnet for people looking to create anonymous shell companies, which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes\u201d. Several accounting experts said there are many legitimate reasons why US and foreign companies incorporate in Delaware, particularly because of its highly respected Court of Chancery and business-friendly state government. The process of setting up a company in the state can be completed in just a few hours and requires less paperwork than registering for a library card in the state. There are more than 1m companies registered in the state \u2013 more than Delaware\u2019s population of 935,000. In the US presidential election, Clinton\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders has led the charge to counter corporate greed, and highlighted the tax havens revealed by the Panama Papers as evidence that \u201cthe wealthiest people and largest corporations must start paying their fair share of taxes\u201d. Clinton has called offshore tax havens \u201ca perversion\u201d of the legal code, and Obama called for reform of the international system earlier this month. Even Trump has said he supports raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, \u201cincluding myself\u201d, though his tax plan offers cuts. The Guardian Media Group, owner of theguardian.com, is registered in Dover, Delaware. \u201cGuardian Media Group has business operations in the UK, US and Australia,\u201d a Guardian spokesperson said. \u201cThe group\u2019s assets are held entirely by companies in these countries and are fully subject to prevailing tax laws and regulations. The group also has a UK endowment fund which holds a mixture of UK and non-UK assets and is fully subject to UK tax laws and regulations.\u201d",

A poll by research firm Gravis Marketing last week showed Trump had a 37-point lead over John Kasich; Clinton polled 45%, ahead of Sanders on 38% in the same poll. </p> <p>A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, titled <a href=\"http://itep.org/itep_reports/2015/12/delaware-an-onshore-tax-haven.php#.VwV0PhIrLKI\">Delaware: An Onshore Tax Haven</a>, said the state\u2019s tax code made it \u201ca magnet for people looking to create anonymous shell companies, which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes\u201d.</p> <p>Several accounting experts said there are many legitimate reasons why US and foreign companies incorporate in Delaware, particularly because of its highly respected Court of Chancery and business-friendly state government. The process of setting up a company in the state can be completed in just a few hours and requires less paperwork than registering for a library card in the state. There are more than 1m companies registered in the state \u2013 more than Delaware\u2019s population of 935,000. </p> <p>In the US presidential election, Clinton\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders has led the charge to counter corporate greed, and <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-statement-panama-papers/\">highlighted</a> the tax havens revealed by the Panama Papers as evidence that \u201cthe wealthiest people and largest corporations must start paying their fair share of taxes\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton has called offshore tax havens \u201ca <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/finance/272293-clinton-puts-crosshairs-on-offshore-tax-deals\">perversion</a>\u201d of the legal code, and Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/05/justice-department-panama-papers-mossack-fonseca-us-investigation\">called for reform </a>of the international system earlier this month.
