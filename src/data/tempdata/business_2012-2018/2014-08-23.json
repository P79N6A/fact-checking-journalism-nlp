    "webTitle": "Soaring house prices in Dublin spark fears of new property bubble", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The spectre of property speculation is stalking Ireland once more, as soaring house prices in Dublin bring warnings that the country is in danger of repeating the mistakes that brought the economy to its knees during the financial crisis. Property prices in the Irish capital are rising by an average of \u20ac6,600 a month, according to the country's Central Statistics Office, which puts them 24.4% higher than last year. But as demand for new homes now outstrips supply across Ireland, the body representing mortgage holders warns that the country is becoming obsessed again with inflated house prices. The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation (IMHO) points out that the legacy of the boom-to-bust years is still weighing on thousands of households. Figures from Ireland's central bank show 35,000 homeowners unable to pay their mortgages for up to 24 months, and 135,000 households in mortgage arrears, despite an economic upturn and expectations that GDP will grow by 2.5% this year. IMHO founder David Hall said: \"People crippled by debt and paying new austerity taxes such as property tax and upcoming water taxes are watching with shock at the new development of property porn. We see commentary after commentary that prices are rising and negative equity is reducing, yet this is no comfort to those crippled in debt. A reduction in negative equity might be of benefit to banks who consider repossessing homes. But increases in property prices do not help with a family's affordability in paying their mortgage.\" Hall accuses Ireland's banks and property industry of fuelling a fake mini-boom. He claims it is designed to increase the paper assets of Irish banks before they face stress tests from the European Central Bank in October. \"This property bubble being developed by vested interests needs bursting and bursting sooner rather than later,\" he added. \"The financial system owes a gratitude to the Irish citizen for keeping it afloat and now it needs to back off irresponsible promoting of a property bubble, which could land many citizens in deep financial trouble again.\" But economists at a Dublin-based investment bank argue that the real problem in the resurgent Irish property market is supply rather than increasing demand. Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says high VAT rates on new homes, as well as other taxes, are the central reasons for poor supply in the market. He points out that construction of new housing units in the republic is running 25% lower than the yearly average over the past four decades. In 2013 only 8,301 housing units were built in Ireland, and the figure is not expected to exceed 9,000 this year. O'Sullivan says: \"The reality is that the effective cost of bringing a new unit to market in most of Ireland is higher than the achievable sales price at this time. This is why completions are running at about a quarter of their long-term average, while many of the units finished in the recent past involved the completion of semi-built developments from the bubble era.\" He adds that a reduction in local authority charges on construction sites would increase the supply of private housing, and VAT could even be temporarily suspended to allow builders to meet rising demand. \"Underlying demand is robust, so the main challenge is to find ways to encourage new supply,\" O'Sullivan says. According to government statistics, the average cost of a Dublin home now stands at \u20ac349,000, a rise of \u20ac71,000 on last summer. But the picture outside Dublin is much less robust: residential property prices in the rest of Ireland have risen by only 2.3% compared with June last year. O'Sullivan says the Irish central bank in Dublin has already promised to introduce measures to cool the market down if it reaches boom-years levels again. He adds that mortgage credit lending is 93% down on the rate of bank and building society lending to borrowers during the boom. However, the warning from the IMHO about Ireland becoming re-addicted to \"property porn\" is a reminder of the cost the country paid for the house-price bubble from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, when parts of Dublin were among the most expensive real estate on the planet. Property tycoons and business figures borrowed billions of euros from banks to buy into a market that seemed to be going in one direction \u2013 up. But when the financial crash of 2008-9 wiped out property prices, Irish entrepreneurs like one-time billionaire Sean Quinn lost their fortunes. And the banks they borrowed from, such as the notorious Anglo Irish Bank, had to be rescued by Irish and later European taxpayers from total collapse. Since then there has been a painful atonement through public spending cuts. Last December the Irish government confirmed that it would be the first bailed-out eurozone state to leave its international rescue programme. This came three years after the country avoided bankruptcy thanks only to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union with a \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a354bn) loan. It was accompanied by sombre warnings that the nation remained heavily indebted and austerity must continue. But finance minister Michael Noonan appeared to foresee this year's troubling housing revival. \"We can't go mad again,\" he said.",

The radical idea, which would involve new legislation, is to be included in the Liberal Democrats' election manifesto and will be a key demand of the party in any negotiations on a new coalition deal with either the Tories or Labour for the next parliament. Under Cable's blueprint, companies would also have to publish details of median pay levels for staff so that they could be compared with the amounts paid to the highest earners in each firm, in a bid to increase transparency. Details of the manifesto commitment reflect the Liberal Democrats' drive to present themselves as the most consistent advocates of \"fair pay\" at the next election. Having been severely criticised for a series of policy U-turns, including those on tuition fees and a rise in VAT in 2010, which party leader Nick Clegg had opposed, the Lib Dems say that on fair pay they have delivered \u2013 most notably honouring their pledge to raise the rate at which income tax becomes payable from \u00a36,500 in 2010 to \u00a310,000. In April the tax-free threshold will be raised again to \u00a310,500, as announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, in his last budget. Osborne has angered the Lib Dems by trying to take personal credit for the increase, which they say has only happened at their insistence. In March this year, Clegg accused his coalition partners of displaying \"brass neck\" by claiming ownership of the policy. Last year Cable introduced new rules forcing publicly listed companies to give shareholders a binding vote on directors' pay. A listed firm's remuneration policy now requires the approval of more than 50% of shareholders to be passed. However, the new moves announced on Sunday would go much further, affecting all companies with more than 250 employees. Workers would not be able to veto or block pay deals for top earners, but Cable believes strong objections from a workforce would put pressure on bosses and, if ignored, would have a bad \"reputational impact\". Similar proposals were made by the High Pay Commission, established by the centre-left thinktank Compass and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, which reported in November 2011. The government took up many of the commission's proposals, tightening rules on transparency, but Cable believes more still needs to be done. Between 1998 and 2010, while general average earnings grew by 4%, average pay for chief executives rose by 13% each year, despite no overall increase in the FTSE 100 share index over that time. In the \"shareholder spring\" of 2012, investors mounted several high-profile challenges to executive pay packages, in protest at boardroom salaries rising when share prices were declining. Cable now wants to empower workers as a well as shareholders. Ministers say there has been some progress to curb excessive pay as a result of reforms introduced to date. Median total remuneration awarded to FTSE 100 chief executives fell by 5% in 2012 and by a further 7% in 2013 (using their methodology).",
