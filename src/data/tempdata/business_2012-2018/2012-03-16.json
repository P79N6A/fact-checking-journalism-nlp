      "bodyText": "Video games specialist Game was teetering on the brink of collapse on Friday after a rescue deal put forward by private equity firm OpCapita appeared to have been given the cold shoulder by lenders who are owed more than \u00a3100m. Earlier this week, OpCapita, the turnaround specialist which recently bought electricals chain Comet, put forward a proposal to the retailer's banks \u2013 led by state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 to take over its debt and settle accounts with suppliers who are owed \u00a340m. The plan offers a way back for the retailer, which officially warned investors at the start of this week that it was on the brink of administration. A spokesman for RBS, which is owed \u00a345m, said talks with all parties were continuing, but insiders suggested further discussions had not taken place even though time is short. Game needs to secure new financial backers quickly so it can pay its quarterly rent bill, due on 25 March, and avoid a painful restructuring that is likely to involve heavy job losses at the group, which has around 6,000 UK staff. The situation is a complicated one as a number of banks are involved in the rescue talks, with Barclays, HSBC and La Caixa all understood to be owed around \u00a330m each. Another banking source also suggested the OpCapita deal was still a viable option. The crisis at Game was set in train earlier this year when worried lenders reduced the retailer's borrowing facilities. That meant the management team, led by chief executive Ian Shepherd, was forced to ask suppliers for discounts. However major industry players such as Electronic Arts and Nintendo refused, leaving the retailer without stock of new titles such as Mass Effect 3 and Mario Party 9. Game's problems come at a low point for the industry which has suffered falling sales for the past three years due to the absence of a killer new console to whet consumers' appetites. Sales of physical, boxed games were down 7% at \u00a31.4bn last year. Just as HMV, the last national music and DVD chain on the high street, has been hit by rising internet sales, downloads and competition from supermarkets, Game is also suffering as gamers cut out the middle man. Industry trade body UKIE reckons nearly \u00a3680m was spent on game downloads last year. \"People are buying more and more games but they are looking at increasingly digital methods of purchasing them,\" says UKIE's Dan Wood, pointing to games such as Angry Birds, which has now been downloaded 500m times. The speed with which sales are transferring to the internet has caught retail chains big and small off guard. Game has 600 UK stores \u2013 a legacy of the boom years that preceded the financial crisis \u2013 and that is seen as too many at a time when Britons' disposable incomes are under pressure. Game's woes are set against a backdrop of industry change with some commentators going as far as to predict the \"death of the disc\" after industry blogs buzzed with rumours that Microsoft had said its hotly anticipated Xbox 720 will not contain a disc drive. All might not be lost for retailers, however, because although the Xbox might not take discs, it might use a smaller cartridge instead. There is a practical reason for this because weak internet connections in some countries are a barrier to an iTunes-style buying revolution. Experts point to comments made by key industry figures such as Sony's chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, who told one interviewer: \"We are doing business not just in the developed nations of the world, but also in parts of the world where network infrastructure isn't as robust as one would hope for. There's always going to be requirement for a business with the size and scope of our magnitude to have a physical medium. To think everything will be downloaded in two years, three years or even 10 years from now is taking it a little bit to the extreme.\"",

      "bodyText": "Eurozone leaders will inject more than \u20ac250bn (\u00a3207bn) into the single currency's protection fund in a desperate effort to prevent contagion from Greece, it emerged on Friday. Finance ministers will agree the package in a fortnight, although it will still leave the insurance scheme around \u20ac1.3tn short of City estimates of the firewall needed to protect Italy and Spain from a panic that would follow if Greece went bust. Officials said the main protection fund, the temporary \u20ac440bn European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), will be increased to around \u20ac700bn, before the introduction next year of the permanent European Stability Mechanism. The extra funds are expected to be in place by the summer to insure against a lending freeze by private investors. Brussels has dismissed estimates that a \u20ac2tn fund would be needed to provide sufficient confidence in the eurozone. Officials believe a compromise between Germany and France, which wanted to put in place a bigger firewall, will safeguard the euro's future. The German government has lobbied for the fund to be restricted to protect its taxpayers from potential liabilities, which will mostly fall on Berlin. German officials believe the scale of the fund will be sufficient to ringfence Greece and allow it to go bust without spreading fears of contagion to other countries. But City analysts said the scheme needed to be larger to cover Ireland, Portugal and Greece, together with Italy and Spain, to be credible with international investors. The deal to rescue Greece agreed last week is widely believed to be insufficient to prevent its collapse in the coming months. The US investment bank Citi saidon Friday it estimated there was a 50% chance of Greece defaulting further. It accused the troika of EU representatives, International Monetary Fund advisers and the European Central Bank of underestimating the task facing Athens as it is forced to make huge cuts in wages, pensions and welfare spending. \"While the debt sustainability analysis includes lots of sensible assumptions, we regard others, particularly the outlook for GDP growth in combination with further massive fiscal tightening in coming years and the targeted privatisation revenues, as too optimistic,\" it said. Greece struck a deal to wipe out \u20ac100bn of its private sector debts and access more EU funds to bring its total bailout to \u20ac240bn.

The lack of support from analysts for the deal has kept markets treading water. The FTSE index closed 24.86 points higher at 5965.58, just short of the 6000 level reached last July. Germany's Dax was up 0.16%, France's Cac rose 0.36% while the Dow Jones industrial average, which has jumped in recent months on the back of stronger US economic figures was up 4 points as London closed. Concerns that European leaders underestimate the scale of the task were fuelled by the French socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande who reopened the debate about austerity versus growth in a television interview. In comments which are unlikely to go down well in Berlin or Brussels, he promised to renegotiate the recently agreed EU fiscal compact if he won the presidential election which reaches a climax in May. Although he said he would balance the budget by 2017, he said he would cancel cuts that risked undermining the country's propects for cutting unemployment and raising living standards. Growth had to be put back into Europe, he said, adding that Germany alone should not decide the course of the continent. \"I will make the savings that are needed, but at the same time I will not sacrifice the interests of our country.\" Hollande's deficit targets are based on forecasts of 1.7% growth in 2013, 2% in 2014 and between 2-2.5% from 2015 to 2017, figures which economists have said are overly optimistic. Hollande's comments follow a deal between Brussels and the newly elected right wing Spanish government resulted in a higher deficit target for this year. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy succeeded in raising the target from 4.4% to 5.3%, but at the cost of greater scrutiny by Brussels of Madrid's budget plans. In Cyprus, which uses the euro in the southern, non Turkish half of the country, finance minister Kikis Kazamias resigned today following disagreement over economic policies with the island's president, Demetris Christofias. Announcing the resignation, a government spokesman denied that the veteran communist 61-year-old, an expert in international economic relations, was resigning because he was at odds with Christofias. \"The finance minister had some days ago submitted his resignation to the president, exclusively because of health reasons,\" the spokesman, Stefanos Stefanou, said. But Kazamias has quit shortly after Cyprus' sovereign rating was downgraded to junk (with a negative outlook) by Moody's citing the island's exposure to debt stricken Greece. The investors service argued there was a heightened risk the Cypriot government, itself no longer able to borrow on capital markets, would have to support banks that have taken a beating because of their exposure to Athens. The level of recapitalisation required could exceed 20% of Cyprus's GDP, the agency estimated.

When the fund already has a \u00a3230m hole to close and total liabilities of \u00a31.7bn there is an immediate concern the fund will never have enough money to pay pensions, especially when the baby boomer generation of workers are all retired after 2030. More than 7,000 companies are saddled with unaffordable final salary pension promises made in an era when only a few people benefited, promises were loosely framed and investment forecasts were stratospheric and meant pension savings were worth four times what they are now. Today, thanks to Trinity Mirror's former owner, the late Robert Maxwell and his \u00a3300m pension heist, we have a privatised pension scheme ensnared with thousands of pages of legislation that is impossible to disentangle.

For instance the former socialist government of Spain increased the retirement age, but told workers that started their careers at age 16 or 18 they would get their pensions before college graduates who started work at 21. By contrast, Tesco has told employees they must work till they are 67 for a full retirement income regardless of when they started. France and Germany have bitten the bullet and cut pension payouts across the board and put their economies in a better position. The UK solution is to retain overly generous incomes for a small rump of workers and next to nothing for the rest. To end the battle between the generations and between blue and white collar workers, a radical government would step in and nationalise the lot. A move to take over all the pension funds, put them in the PPF, apply the PPF rules and run them as one great big scheme would drive a stake into the heart of capital ownership and would be ruled out by the European Court of Justice. The only other solution is for companies to \"do a Trinity Mirror\" and save themselves the cash today - kicking the problem down the road. If the pensions regulator had any sense it would debate this problem openly. Young people need work with solvent employers more than they need to protect the fat pension of an over 50s middle manager. But the regulator prefers to secretively and away from public glare follow its baby boomer brief, which is to protect the promises they made to themselves at all costs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hector Sants, the Financial Services Authority chief executive who had been expected to head a new banking supervisory body, is to quit the regulator in June. His exit is the latest in a number of senior departures and a severe blow to the planned new regulatory regime. The former Credit Suisse First Boston banker is leaving after five years as chief executive of the FSA, before it is split into two new bodies in March or April next year. Margaret Cole, who had been the FSA's managing director of business conduct, also left recently. Sants had already resigned in 2010 but was persuaded by the incoming coalition government to stay and oversee the transition to a new regulatory regime known as the \"twin peaks\" model \u2013 banking supervision will pass to the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which will become part of the Bank of England, and there will be a separate consumer watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Sants would have headed up the PRA and become one of three deputy governors of the Bank. Chancellor George Osborne said Sants had \"found a natural moment to seek new challenges after eight years at the FSA and having successfully overseen planning for the transition to the new supervisory structure.\". He added: \"I am very grateful for all the good work that Hector has done. He has been an outstanding public servant.\" Sants's deputy, Andrew Bailey, will take over his role as head of the Prudential Business Unit, the part of the FSA now mirroring the future PRA. Martin Wheatley will remain head of the Conduct Business Unit and become the future chief executive of the FCA. Sants's departure comes after Michael Fallon, a senior Conservative member of the cross-party Treasury select committee, declared he had \"deep reservations\" about him leading the PRA. He claimed that other committee members shared his reservations about Sants's suitability. However, there is also speculation that Sants was losing patience with the pace of change due to delays in the legislative process. Simon Morris of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna said: \"The recent drubbing he received before the Treasury select committee on his role (or lack of it) in supervising RBS probably damaged his credibility.\" Sants said in a statement: \"When I agreed to stay on as CEO in 2010, I committed to stay and deliver an orderly transition to the government's new regulatory structure. The project is now firmly on track and with the establishment of twin peaks within the FSA I will have achieved that goal. Now is the right time to hand over to those who will deliver the long-term goals of the future PRA and FCA. I am proud of what the FSA has achieved during my time in charge, through what have been incredibly challenging times.\" FSA chairman Adair Turner said: \"The major reforms made within the FSA since the financial crisis and the progress in delivering the government's plan would not have been possible without Hector. He is a truly outstanding public servant of great integrity and has provided the FSA with dedicated leadership and focus through extremely turbulent times.\" The 56-year-old wants to find another senior job in the public or private sector after his six-month gardening leave ends. He will remain on full pay during this period and will also be entitled to an annual bonus, which he usually gives to charity. Last year he received a bonus of \u00a3115,000, as well as a \u00a3500,000 salary, \u00a360,000 pension and other benefits worth \u00a3131,810. Sants joined the FSA in 2004, having previously worked at CSFB and UBS. He has also served as a board member of the Securities and Futures Authority, Financial Reporting Council, London Clearing House and the London Stock Exchange. He has a degree in psychology and philosophy from Oxford University. Following Sants's departure both Bailey and Wheatley will directly report to Lord Turner, the FSA's chairman. Of the FSA's 4,000 staff, 1,500 will transfer to the PRA and the rest to the FCA. The PRA is expected to be housed in 20 Moorgate, the home of broker Cazenove, which is moving to Docklands. The FCA will be based at the FSA's current headquarters in Canary Wharf. Sants's departure is \"less surprising than it may at first appear,\" said Greg Brandman, partner at international law firm Eversheds who previously worked in the FSA's enforcement division. \"If anything, Hector's original change of heart, going back on his decision to leave the FSA, was more surprising.\" He added: \"There has been a constant bleeding of senior staff from the regulator since early 2010 and this seems set to continue. Change is traumatic for any organisation and the FSA is no different. Ongoing uncertainty about who will be at the helm during a period of radical regulatory change is bad for the FSA and bad for the City. The only thing that seems certain is that it will be a bumpy few months ahead as we see the enactment of the financial services bill and the implementation of the government's regulatory reform programme.\" Rob Moulton at law firm Ashurst said: \"The tectonic plates are shifting, with the FSA about to start functional dual regulation, and so it makes sense for the single chief executive to make way at this point for his successors. Many in the industry may not fully recognise the impressive, transformed institution described in the FSA's glowing press release, but few can doubt the importance of his contribution during a period of unprecedented turbulence in both the markets and the regulator.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ana Bot\u00edn collected a pay and perks package worth more than \u00a34m in her first full year in charge of Santander UK, part of the Spanish banking group built up by her father Emilio. Details of the payout come only weeks after Santander UK disclosed that profits fell 40% last year to less than \u00a31bn as it was hit by a \u00a3500m charge for compensation claims over mis\u2013sold payment protection insurance. Bot\u00edn took over as UK chief in December 2010. She becomes one of Britain's best paid female executives after taking home \u00a32.2m in cash, with the remainder, a mix of cash and shares, to vest between the end of 2012 and 2015. Bot\u00edn's basic salary in 2011 was \u00a31.7m. It compares with a package worth \u00a32.17m for Cynthia Carroll, chief executive of mining group Anglo American, while Royal Bank of Scotland's head of US operations, Ellen Alemany, may receive as much as \u00a34.8m this year. A spokesman for Santander UK said the bank \"was sensitive to public opinion over the issue of remuneration for bankers, but our pay policy reflects the success of the business\". He added: \"Santander UK has delivered a solid performance in difficult conditions without resorting to government assistance, generating consistent profits and cash for the Santander group, which in turn has paid \u20ac24bn (\u00a320bn) to shareholders over the last five years, and of which 1.6m reside in the UK.\" Santander also pointed out its British operation last year increased lending to small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) by 25%, exceeding government targets by lending \u00a38.7bn to UK companies, with around half that figure made up of loans to SMEs. But Santander UK was fined \u00a31.5m by the City regulator for failing to make clear to thousands of investors that two of its investment plans were not fully covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, despite the fact that both were sold as \"guaranteed\" bonds. The Financial Services Authority said that despite the fact that Santander received many queries from its customers, it did not clarify the position until early 2010. Ana Bot\u00edn has worked at Santander since 1988. She was parachuted in from Spain to take over the UK arm when Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio suddenly quit to run Lloyds Banking Group. In Britain, where the Spanish bank bought Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and part of Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bot\u00edn warned in February that \"2012 is likely to be a tough year for the UK banking industry\". She added: \"Economic prospects have deteriorated markedly even in recent months, whilst increased regulatory burdens and funding costs will impact the results further.\" A flotation of the UK business, already severely delayed, now appears to be more than a year away as it grapples with an economy that is growing more slowly than it had expected.",

It compares with a package worth \u00a32.17m for Cynthia Carroll, chief executive of mining group Anglo American, while Royal Bank of Scotland's head of US operations, Ellen Alemany, may receive as much as \u00a34.8m this year.</p> <p>A spokesman for Santander UK said the bank \"was sensitive to public opinion over the issue of remuneration for bankers, but our pay policy reflects the success of the business\".</p> <p>He added: \"Santander UK has delivered a solid performance in difficult conditions without resorting to government assistance, generating consistent profits and cash for the Santander group, which in turn has paid \u20ac24bn (\u00a320bn) to shareholders over the last five years, and of which 1.6m reside in the UK.\"</p> <p>Santander also pointed out its British operation last year increased lending to small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) by 25%, exceeding government targets by lending \u00a38.7bn to UK companies, with around half that figure made up of loans to SMEs.</p> <p>But Santander UK was fined \u00a31.5m by the City regulator for failing to make clear to thousands of investors that two of its investment plans were not fully covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, despite the fact that both were sold as \"guaranteed\" bonds.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority said that despite the fact that Santander received many queries from its customers, it did not clarify the position until early 2010.</p> <p>Ana Bot\u00edn has worked at Santander since 1988. She was parachuted in from Spain to take over the UK arm when Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio suddenly quit to run Lloyds Banking Group.</p> <p>In Britain, where the Spanish bank bought Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and part of Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bot\u00edn warned in February that \"2012 is likely to be a tough year for the UK banking industry\".</p> <p>She added: \"Economic prospects have deteriorated markedly even in recent months, whilst increased regulatory burdens and funding costs will impact the results further.\"</p> <p>A flotation of the UK business, already severely delayed, now appears to be more than a year away as it grapples with an economy that is growing more slowly than it had expected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With tensions growing between the UK and Argentina over the Falklands, investors are keeping an eye on every update from companies operating in the region. Argentina said on Thursday it would take legal action explorers off the Falklands, and now Borders &amp; Southern has announced delays with its Darwin prospect after unspecified technical issues involved rig equipment. The well is now operating again, but it will need an extra four to five weeks of work to get back on track. After an early dip in the company's share price, it is now 2.5p higher at 70.25p. Dr Dougie Youngson at Seymour Pierce said: This is a disappointing result today as we had actually been expecting this well to have been completed about now.
