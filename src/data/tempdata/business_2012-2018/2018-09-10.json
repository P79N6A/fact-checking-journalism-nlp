Revealing increasing divisions across the country, the latest snapshot from the jobs market by the employment agency ManpowerGroup comes less than 200 days before Britain is due to formally leave the EU. The poll of 2,100 employers across nine different industry sectors suggested 2018 is the weakest year for jobs confidence among UK employers since 2012, amid growing fears over the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit scenario. Closely watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warning signs from the British economy, the survey found employers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were much more pessimistic than English companies when it came to their hiring plans for the next three months. Across the country as a whole, a net balance of only 4% of firms planned to increase staffing levels rather than make cuts. Among the most optimistic sectors for employment were the utility industries, where the installation of smart meters was driving demand for more workers. Although employers in England were more positive about hiring than earlier this year, hiring sentiment among Welsh businesses was the weakest in eight years, with a net balance of -8% planning to hire staff. Fears over the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland were recorded among businesses in the region, damaging hiring confidence, while Scottish firms were also more downbeat about their hiring prospects than their English counterparts. Edinburgh has more than 10% of its population employed in financial services, which could become vulnerable in the event of a hard Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will meet car industry executives at a summit in Birmingham amid growing concern in the industry about the pace of the Brexit negotiations and the impact of a no-deal scenario on the sector. On Tuesday the prime minister was due to highlight the potential for low emissions technology but before the meeting the industry\u2019s trade body emphasised that ministers have to ensure that the UK would remain an attractive investment environment post Brexit. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders, said the industry welcomed the focus on cutting emissions but warned that the UK could only be a global leader in the right circumstances. In a veiled reference to Brexit, he added: \u201cThis means creating the right conditions to encourage manufacturers to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and provide the right incentives and infrastructure to take the consumer with us. \u201cGovernment must set out a long-term commitment, with a world-class package of tangible support that matches our world-class ambitions.\u201d The car industry employs 162,000 people in the UK, representing 1% of the entire workforce, and there have been repeated warnings that a no-deal Brexit could mean jobs are at risk because manufacturing components would be likely to attract tariffs. A briefing paper produced by the House of Commons library on Monday concluded that \u201cmost economic modelling\u201d shows that \u201cpotential benefits of leaving the EU with no deal over the longer term do not make up for the higher trade barriers\u201d. One of the examples cited in the paper was the automotive sector, where the car manufacturer Honda has previously warned a select committee that the imposition of tariffs \u201cwould make UK manufactured vehicles uncompetitive\u201d. The event in Birmingham has been organised by the Department for Transport, and would see May announce a \u00a3106m funding boost for research and development in green vehicles, new batteries and low carbon technology. The prime minister said she wanted to put \u201cthe UK at the forefront of the design and manufacturing of zero-emission vehicles\u201d and she called \u201cfor all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040\u201d. Pro-remain opposition politicians said that May should also have referred to Brexit and the deal she hoped to secure from Brussels. Alison McGovern, a Labour backbencher whose seat includes a Vauxhall car plant, said: \u201cNone of the objectives the prime minister is setting out will be deliverable if we crash out of the EU on hard and destructive terms.\u201d Ministers have been summoned to Downing Street on Thursday to discuss the UK\u2019s preparations for a no-deal ahead of the release of a second batch of official papers detailing how businesses and organisations should respond if the country crashes out of the European Union without agreeing divorce terms. The second set of papers were expected to raise more serious concerns than the batch released last month, which warned that the cost of credit card payments between the UK and EU would increase in a no-deal scenario and that businesses would have to start planning for new customs checks. No 10\u2019s preference was to secure a Brexit deal based on May\u2019s Chequers plan, which would see the UK strike a free trade deal with the European Union by agreeing to remain in a \u201ccommon rulebook\u201d for goods and food, although she has to face down a rebellion by the right in her own party and persuade the EU to sign up. Last week, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator, had warned that he was \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d to the UK\u2019s customs proposal and advised European car manufacturers that they will have to use fewer British-made parts after Brexit. The Commons library paper said that around 44% of car components used in British car manufacturing come from UK suppliers, which was already below the 55% to 60% normally required in a free trade agreement for automotive goods such as the trade deal the EU has signed with South Korea. \u201cIn order for EU carmakers to benefit from the tariff benefits of the EU-Korea agreement [pdf], only a certain proportion of the services may be provided in a car in a third country. Businesses have to be careful not to use too many parts of Britain in their vehicles in the future,\u201d Barnier said at the time.",

    "webTitle": "Don't believe the marketing - the biggest tax cuts are not for 'middle Australia' | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Parliamentary Budget Office has very clearly shown the government\u2019s sales pitch for the income tax cuts to be false. Had you gone by the marketing you would be believing the government was giving those on median income or \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d the biggest help. But the PBO has shown that the tax cuts are overwhelmingly targeted towards giving the wealthiest the biggest cut. The overriding reason given by then prime minister and treasurer Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison for their income tax cut policy was that we needed to help \u201caspirational\u201d workers and that bracket creep was doing them damage. The argument on bracket creep was always pretty disingenuous given Turnbull at the time suggested it was all about people turning down a higher paying job. In June he rather oddly asked \u201chow many times have we heard over the years \u2013 people say bracket creep is a real disincentive for people getting ahead? For getting another job, for taking a promotion, for working overtime?\u201d Suddenly it seemed we lived in a world where someone on $50,000 was turning down the offer of a job on $90,000 because $3,000 of that new salary would be taxed at 37% rather than 32.5%. It was a pretty disappointing approach from a man who certainly knows how the tax system works. The overriding problem with Turnbull and Morrison\u2019s arguments was that bracket creep is actually an issue, and last week the PBO revealed just how poorly it is addressed by the government\u2019s income tax policy. Each year the PBO releases its medium-term budget projections. These, as with all PBO work, is done independently of treasury and finance but does rely on the assumptions within the budget such as \u201cabove trend economic growth for much of the period and a return to close to trend wages growth by the end of the forward estimates period\u201d. The PBO estimates that the budget should be back in surplus by 2019-20. It is also worth noting that while government spending is expected to fall as a percentage of GDP at no point in the next 10 years is it expected to reach a level that would have seen a budget surplus in any of the years from 2008-09 to 2016-17. As I noted after the May budget, budget surpluses occur due to increased revenue, not reduced spending: And that increase in revenue is mostly coming from increases in income tax. The PBO projects that by 2028-29 the level of personal income tax will have risen from 11.5% of GDP this year to 12.5% \u2013 the highest since the introduction of the GST. At the same time the level of company tax revenue is expected to fall to 4.3% of GDP from its current level of 4.7%: This might seem surprising given most of us are getting a tax cut. Indeed the PBO confirms that under the government\u2019s tax plan the average tax rate for everyone earning over $36,000 will fall: But as I noted at the time the benefits were greatly skewed in favour of the wealthy. The PBO confirms this by finding that the cut in the average tax rate increases from 0.62% pts for those earning $86,000 to 3.63% pts for those on $199,000: The change in the average tax rate however does not detail the increased amount individuals will pay in income tax due to bracket creep. Bracket creep involves you paying a higher average rate of tax because of increases in your wage \u2013 not due to your taking a new job, but because of a pay rise. Income tax is paid on nominal income, so even if your wage goes up only in line with inflation and thus in real terms you are no better off, the level of your average tax rate will have increased. It is always a bigger issue for those earning lower amounts. When you look at the graph of the average tax rates, it is clear why this is the case \u2013 the more you earn the flatter the average tax rate becomes. Consider that even under the new income tax plan, going from $45,000 to $55,000 involves your average tax rate going from 13.3% to 16.8%, an increase of 3.5% pts, even though they remain in the same marginal tax bracket. By contrast someone going from $125,000 to $135,000 sees their average tax rate go from 25.6% to 26.1% - an increase of just 0.5% pts \u2013 ie barely noticeable and absolutely no real disincentive to work at all. So any policy to combat bracket creep must therefore be overwhelmingly targeted towards lower to middle incomes, and yet the government\u2019s plan does not. The PBO highlights this by looking at the changes in the average tax rate not by income but by income quintiles. The PBO estimates that those on the lowest income quintile (ie the poorest 20% of the population) will not see much of a rise in their tax rate. This is not surprising given most of these people earn less or just over the tax free threshold. But for those in the second bottom and middle income quintile the impact of bracket creep is substantial \u2013 causing their average tax rate to rise by 5.4% pts compared to just 2.9% pts for the richest 20%. Now that again is not surprising given the median taxable income is around $55,000, so those earning around that or just below it are going to see big increases in their average tax rate should their wage go up by $5,000 to $10,000 over the next 6 years compared to someone in the top 20%. But the problem is that while the tax cuts will remove three quarters of the bracket creep for the richest 20%, it will only account for 15% of the bracket creep for the median income earners: As a result those in the second and third income quintiles will see their average tax rates go up by 4.5% pts and 4.6% pts even after the tax cuts, while the top 20% will see their average tax rate rise by just 0.8% pts \u2013 the same amount as for those in the lowest income quintile. The government\u2019s income tax policy was always pitched as being for average Australians, for \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. That was always a fib, and the PBO has very loudly made this clear. It is an income tax policy designed to benefit those who need tax relief the least. A policy designed to deliver large tax cuts to the wealthy under the guise of helping those on median incomes. Don\u2019t believe the marketing, believe the facts. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Had you gone by the marketing you would be believing the government was giving those on median income or \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d the biggest help. But the PBO has shown that the tax cuts are overwhelmingly targeted towards giving the wealthiest the biggest cut. </p> <p>The overriding reason given by then prime minister and treasurer Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison for their income tax cut policy was that we needed to help \u201caspirational\u201d workers and that bracket creep was doing them damage. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/31/tax-cuts-are-awful-for-middle-australia-to-pretend-otherwise-is-misleading\">Tax cuts are awful for 'middle Australia'. Pretending otherwise is misleading | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The argument on bracket creep was always pretty disingenuous given Turnbull at the time suggested it was all about people turning down a higher paying job. </p> <p>In June <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/10/theres-a-new-cultural-war-and-its-targeting-progressive-tax-rates\">he rather oddly asked</a> \u201chow many times have we heard over the years \u2013 people say bracket creep is a real disincentive for people getting ahead? For getting another job, for taking a promotion, for working overtime?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly it seemed we lived in a world where someone on $50,000 was turning down the offer of a job on $90,000 because $3,000 of that new salary would be taxed at 37% rather than 32.5%. It was a pretty disappointing approach from a man who certainly knows how the tax system works.</p> <p>The overriding problem with Turnbull and Morrison\u2019s arguments was that bracket creep is actually an issue, and last week the PBO revealed just how poorly it is addressed by the government\u2019s income tax policy. </p> <p>Each year the PBO releases its <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Budget_Office/Publications/Research_reports/Medium-term_budget_projections\">medium-term budget projections</a>. These, as with all PBO work, is done independently of treasury and finance but does rely on the assumptions within the budget such as \u201cabove trend economic growth for much of the period and a return to close to trend wages growth by the end of the forward estimates period\u201d. </p> <p>The PBO estimates that the budget should be back in surplus by 2019-20. It is also worth noting that while government spending is expected to fall as a percentage of GDP at no point in the next 10 years is it expected to reach a level that would have seen a budget surplus in any of the years from 2008-09 to 2016-17. </p> <p>As I noted after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/08/the-budget-in-seven-graphs-nice-for-now-but-horror-lies-ahead\">the May budget</a>, budget surpluses occur due to increased revenue, not reduced spending:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Budget receipts and spending projections\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TlKLD/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And that increase in revenue is mostly coming from increases in income tax. </p> <p>The PBO projects that by 2028-29 the level of personal income tax will have risen from 11.5% of GDP this year to 12.5% \u2013 the highest since the introduction of the GST. At the same time the level of company tax revenue is expected to fall to 4.3% of GDP from its current level of 4.7%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tax revenue projections\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hfKF8/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This might seem surprising given most of us are getting a tax cut. Indeed the PBO confirms that under the government\u2019s tax plan the average tax rate for everyone earning over $36,000 will fall:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average tax rate by taxable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/74bAS/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But as I noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/31/tax-cuts-are-awful-for-middle-australia-to-pretend-otherwise-is-misleading\">at the time</a> the benefits were greatly skewed in favour of the wealthy. The PBO confirms this by finding that the cut in the average tax rate increases from 0.62% pts for those earning $86,000 to 3.63% pts for those on $199,000:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in average tax rate from 2018-19 to 2024-25\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kacfL/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The change in the average tax rate however does not detail the increased amount individuals will pay in income tax due to bracket creep. </p> <p>Bracket creep involves you paying a higher average rate of tax because of increases in your wage \u2013 not due to your taking a new job, but because of a pay rise. </p> <p>Income tax is paid on nominal income, so even if your wage goes up only in line with inflation and thus in real terms you are no better off, the level of your average tax rate will have increased. </p> <p>It is always a bigger issue for those earning lower amounts. When you look at the graph of the average tax rates, it is clear why this is the case \u2013 the more you earn the flatter the average tax rate becomes. </p> <p>Consider that even under the new income tax plan, going from $45,000 to $55,000 involves your average tax rate going from 13.3% to 16.8%, an increase of 3.5% pts, even though they remain in the same marginal tax bracket. By contrast someone going from $125,000 to $135,000 sees their average tax rate go from 25.6% to 26.1% - an increase of just 0.5% pts \u2013 ie barely noticeable and absolutely no real disincentive to work at all. </p> <p>So any policy to combat bracket creep must therefore be overwhelmingly targeted towards lower to middle incomes, and yet the government\u2019s plan does not. </p> <p>The PBO highlights this by looking at the changes in the average tax rate not by income but by income quintiles. </p> <p>The PBO estimates that those on the lowest income quintile (ie the poorest 20% of the population) will not see much of a rise in their tax rate. This is not surprising given most of these people earn less or just over the tax free threshold. </p> <p>But for those in the second bottom and middle income quintile the impact of bracket creep is substantial \u2013 causing their average tax rate to rise by 5.4% pts compared to just 2.9% pts for the richest 20%. </p> <p>Now that again is not surprising given the median taxable income is around $55,000, so those earning around that or just below it are going to see big increases in their average tax rate should their wage go up by $5,000 to $10,000 over the next 6 years compared to someone in the top 20%.</p> <p>But the problem is that while the tax cuts will remove three quarters of the bracket creep for the richest 20%, it will only account for 15% of the bracket creep for the median income earners:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in average tax rate 2017-18 to 2026-27 by income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vxLCa/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/21/its-clear-who-really-benefits-from-tax-cuts-and-its-not-true-blue-battlers\">It's clear who really benefits from tax cuts \u2013 and it's not true-blue battlers | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result those in the second and third income quintiles will see their average tax rates go up by 4.5% pts and 4.6% pts even after the tax cuts, while the top 20% will see their average tax rate rise by just 0.8% pts \u2013 the same amount as for those in the lowest income quintile.</p> <p>The government\u2019s income tax policy was always pitched as being for average Australians, for \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d.

The sketchy description raises too many questions. The first problem is how a government can force all private companies with more than 250 staff to divert a portion of their profits into such a fund. It is clearly within the Treasury\u2019s gift to offer tax breaks to firms that want to offer save-as-you-earn share schemes for staff. But it\u2019s a very different matter for government to give a precise direction over how a slice of profits should be used every year. Should such payments take priority over, say, repairing the pension fund? Since the \u201cownership\u201d contribution would be seen as a payroll cost, what\u2019s to stop companies depressing wages by a similar amount? And how could such a system be imposed on foreign-owned multinationals operating in the UK, such as Airbus, Ford or McDonald\u2019s? The other audience McDonnell will have to convince is workers themselves since, as he told the Observer, the shares would go \u201cinto a pool that will allow them to have an ownership role\u201d. If that implies a collectively-owned pool of shares that cannot be sold by individual beneficiaries, it\u2019s a peculiar definition of ownership, a concept that usually implies the freedom to sell. It is easier in theory to see how dividends (where companies pay them) on the pooled shares could serve as a top-up to wages but there are other complications. Does a employee lose all rights to the dividend income at the moment of retirement? And who decides how the employee shares are voted at annual meetings or when there\u2019s a takeover bid on the table? McDonnell, we\u2019re told, will set out his thinking at a speech at the TUC conference on Tuesday. He needs to.

      "bodyText": "The cost of bread is forecast to rise after the effects of a dry summer pushed up the price of wheat by 25% to 30%. Prices in stores have already risen in recent months and are likely to continue going up as Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Kingsmill, said the impact of its rising costs would be \u201creflected in our ongoing discussions\u201d with retailers. The UK wheat harvest was about 13m tonnes in 2018 compared withup to 16m expected in a good year, sending prices up to \u00a3190 a tonne compared with \u00a3120 a tonne before the Brexit vote in 2016 and \u00a3150 after the subsequent fall in sterling. \u201cOur costs have gone up with wheat up by 30% and we have got to talk about that with retailers,\u201d said the ABF finance director, John Bason. The average price of an 800g white sliced loaf was up more than 8% in July compared with May 2016, the month before the Brexit vote, according to the Office for National Statistics which regularly checks prices in order to calculate overall retail inflation.

Pressure on prices has also come from the increase in the legal minimum wage and other factors.

Charles Clack, a commodities analyst at Rabobank, said there was likely to be pressure on the cost of bread as wheat prices were likely to remain high for at least six months because of a global shortage. \u201cThe heat really ravaged Germany and Poland and yield is really down significantly. There are not only shortages in Europe; other countries including Russia, Australia and Canada have been disappointed in terms of yield,\u201d Clack said.",

In her role as the retailer\u2019s brand ambassador, the host of This Morning and I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 has chosen a selection of \u201cmust-haves\u201d from the autumn collection.The micro-collection will go on sale on 27 September. As ever, there is much to be gleaned from her casting. Rather than designing her own pieces, her involvement is more curatorial, although the company did not rule out a design collaboration in the future. However, her appointment will come as no surprise to anyone following the company\u2019s effort to overhaul its womenswear into something more accessible. M&amp;S is undergoing a substantial restructuring as it attempts halt the long-term decline of its clothing business. It is thought 100 stores may shut in the next four years, while seven are to close more imminently to reduce costs by \u00a3350m over the next three years. Although high street brands tend to cast a face with a certain celebrity cache \u2013 Elton John is said to be starring in John Lewis\u2019 hallowed Christmas advert campaign \u2013 the hiring of Willoughby is being seen as tactical as much as it is newsworthy. It will be seen by many as an attempt to capitalise on some of her everywoman appeal, not to mention her selling power. Willoughby is known for her ability to boost sales of items by posting them on Instagram. After she posted a dress by the high street brand Oasis in June, the company revealed that the piece sold out in record time. The same happened in April with a pink Hunza G swimsuit. M&amp;S may be hoping for a similar effect. That was certainly an intention with one of the company\u2019s previous big name hires, Alexa Chung, whose 2016 range \u2013 Archive by Alexa \u2013 featured reissues of M&amp;S designs from decades past designed in collaboration with Chung. If that collaboration could be seen as a bid to capitalise on a younger, hipper customer, by contrast Willoughby is gunning for a different crowd. The autumn collection was unveiled in June, amid much fanfare about a new direction. Shying away from the usual trend-led must-have items which saw PR triumph over actual fashion \u2013 in 2015, this item was a sold-out suede A-line skirt; in 2013 it was a pink cocoon coat \u2013 it was a collection anchored in sobriety, with as much a focus on classics as anything else. The company\u2019s style director, Belinda Earl, summed it up as \u201cheartland M&amp;S\u201d and \u201cthe mainstays of any woman\u2019s working wardrobe\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Network Rail sells railway arches to investors for \u00a31.5bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail has sold thousands of railway arches to a pair of investors as part of a \u00a31.5bn property deal but vowed that businesses working from the spaces, which have raised fears about rent rises, would be protected by a \u201ctenants\u2019 charter\u201d. Telereal Trillium and Blackstone Property Partners won the bidding for 5,200 properties, the majority of which are arches, the operator of Britain\u2019s rail network said on Monday. The \u00a31.46bn sale proceeds will help fund railway upgrades, Network Rail said, bringing \u201cmajor improvements for passengers and reducing the need for taxpayers to fund the railway\u201d. But the deal has sparked anxiety among tenants, which include independent shops, garages and craft breweries, amid concern that the new owners may impose unaffordable rents. Guardians of the Arches, a campaign group of more than 300 tenants, has already complained of rent rises imposed by Network Rail in the run-up to the sale. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cWe continue to dispute whether selling off the whole estate in one job lot is the best way of supporting small businesses and the local economies which rely on them.\u201d The group had proposed alternatives such as local authorities buying smaller groups of arches. It is now calling for an independent body to carry out an audit of leases included in the sale and publish information about rents and how they are set. The shadow rail minister, Rachael Maskell, called on the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to block the sale, which she said would \u201cundermine the financial sustainability of the railway and damage small and medium-sized enterprises across the country\u201d. The Society of Independent Brewers also voiced concern about the potential impact on brewers producing craft beer underneath the arches. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe would hope that commercial landlords taking over these sites will support their new tenants and not hike prices overnight - something which could easily make viable, popular breweries face closure.\u201d Telereal and Blackstone, which will hold equal ownership stakes, have agreed to sign a charter governing their relationships with tenants. The charter includes promises to listen to their worries about rent reviews and engage with them in a timely fashion, but does not make any promises to curb rents. It promises the owners will consider \u201cnew structures to provide financial or other support\u201d to tenants struggling to pay their bills. But George Grant, owner of Clapham North Motors, said Network Rail had tried to impose a 350% rent increase on the garage \u2013 opened under a London railway arch by his 93-year-old father in 1960. He said he believed the new owners would follow suit. \u201cThe way in which Network Rail have gone about this has been appalling,\u201d said Grant. \u201cI don\u2019t believe for one moment that the people taking over are in it for us.\u201d The business was facing the 350% rise in the run-up to the sale until Network Rail relented and agreed to an increase of nearly double instead. A further 1,800 properties were not included in the sale because Network Rail either needs to keep them to operate the railways or because they are part of the northern gateway redevelopment plan, under the auspices of Manchester city council. Network Rail\u2019s property estate, most of which is changing hands in the sale, brought in revenues of \u00a3304m last year, turning a profit of \u00a381m. But the company that oversees Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure has been looking to offload the majority of the estate to raise funds. The sites are being sold on a 150-year lease, with Network Rail retaining the freehold to ensure it still has right of access for the future operation of the railway. The Network Rail chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, said: \u201cThis deal is great news \u2013 for tenants it will mean significant commitment and investment, and for passengers and taxpayers it will mean massive, essential improvements without an extra burden on the public purse.\u201d David Biggs, the managing director of Network Rail Property, said: \u201cWe are proud to have fostered so many small, independent, diverse businesses and communities across the country, and we are confident that these will continue to thrive under the new owners. \u201cUltimately our role is to run, improve and grow the railway, and managing these properties isn\u2019t essential to that.\u201d The Department for Transport said: \u201cTenants\u2019 rights have been safeguarded in this sale and all current agreements between Network Rail and tenants will be fully honoured.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The hottest summer since records began helped the British economy gather strength in the three months to July, as shoppers hit the high street and England progressed to the semi-finals at the World Cup. The Office for National Statistics said GDP increased by 0.6% in the period from a rate of 0.4% in the previous three months, driven by a rise in activity in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector. The latest snapshot beat forecasts made by City economists for slower growth of 0.5% in the three months to July. James Knightley, chief international economist at the City bank ING, said: \u201cDespite all the doom and gloom surrounding the economy, the toxic political backdrop and Brexit uncertainty, Britain is supposedly booming based on July data.\u201d The latest growth figures show the retail trade contributed 0.11 percentage points to the rate of expansion in the three months to July, as warm weather encouraged sales to provide a much-needed shot in the arm for the UK economy. Several high street retailers have been forced to close shops in recent months, as they face growing pressure from online competitors and waning demand from households struggling with high inflation and weak wage growth. Although food and drink retailers and supermarkets benefited from people watching the football and celebrating the royal wedding, economists said stronger sales across the retail sector masked difficulties for some firms. Retailers of household goods and furniture have come under particular pressure in recent months. The latest figures will be seen as justification at the Bank of England for its decision to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% last month, taking them above the level set for almost a decade since the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street is expected to leave the cost of borrowing on hold when it meets on Thursday. Despite the better news from the services sector, as accountants and lawyers also enjoyed a busier period, manufacturing output declined in July by 0.2%. The ONS said the drop was largely due to a fall in the production of pharmaceutical products, which can produce erratic readings for growth. Pharmaceutical firms have come under increasing pressure as the UK prepares to exit the EU, which could curtail access to European customers for British manufacturers of drugs and medicines. Firms have begun stockpiling supplies, while AstraZeneca has in recent months begun producing drugs in Sweden alongside its operations in the north-west of England as a precaution against Brexit disruption. Energy production also declined, as demand for gas and electricity reduced due to the warmer weather. There was better news for the construction industry, which notched up record output for the usually quiet summer month of July, in the strongest three-month period for the industry since February 2017. Growth in the sector was largely driven by repair and maintenance work. Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed to \u00a33.4bn from \u00a34.7bn in the previous three-month period. Exports and imports of goods between EU countries did however increase by more than with those elsewhere around the world in the past year to July. Some of the benefit for the economy from higher levels of retail spending is likely to be short-lived, as the effects of the warm weather begin to fade along with the boost from the World Cup and royal wedding. Preliminary figures for August from industry surveys have pointed towards subsequent weaker growth. Economists also said disruption from the Brexit negotiations could increasingly weigh on the British economy towards the end of the year, with particular turbulence expected over the coming party conference season with Theresa May facing the threat of rebellion from senior Eurosceptic Tories. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said: \u201cThe long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn, as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams has tried to reassure investors by confirming that it expects to make \u00a333m of annual profits after the department store\u2019s shares dived amid rumours it was considering mass store closures. The company issued a stock market announcement after its shares fell by 10% to 11.5p on Monday, after weekend media reports said it was considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that would enable it to close stores or cut rents. The department store chain\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Bucher, told the stock market: \u201cThe market environment remains challenging and underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months.\u201d But he said that, having cut costs and refinanced, the company was \u201cwell equipped to navigate these market conditions and take advantage of any trading opportunities that emerge\u201d. Debenhams has hired the advisory firm KPMG to help it examine potential ways it could restructure to cope with a downturn in trading that has already hit its rival House of Fraser. The credit insurer Euler Hermes is also thought to have reduced cover for suppliers to Debenhams after the company issued its third profit warning of the year in June. At least 80 head office jobs are also expected to be lost as the chain attempts to cut costs at its fashion and home divisions. That came after credit rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded Debenhams\u2019 credit rating to a level reflecting high risk last month because of the highly competitive and promotional environment in the UK. However, sources said there was no short-term prospect of a CVA as Debenhams remained profitable and KPMG was advising on long-term options, including refinancing its debts. Debenhams said its expected net debt of \u00a3320m by its financial year end in June was in line with previous guidance and well within its limit of \u00a3520m. The company is also expected to receive a cash injection of up to \u00a3250m from the sale of its Danish chain Magasin du Nord, with suitors thought to include the Weston family, which owns Selfridges. Magasin, which has six stores including its famous 124-year-old flagship in Copenhagen city centre, made an underlying profit of \u00a326.6m last year on sales of \u00a3326m. The Debenhams chair, Sir Ian Cheshire, said: \u201cAs we stated in June, the board continues to work with its advisers on longer-term options, which include strengthening our balance sheet and reviewing non-core assets. This activity is in order to maximise value for shareholders and protect other stakeholders, including our employees.\u201d Speculation about the future of Debenhams has escalated since House of Fraser fell into administration last month. The department store chain was rescued in a \u00a390m deal by the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, who is in negotiations with landlords and suppliers in a bid to keep 80% of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores open. The two chains are struggling for survival as shoppers switch to buying fashion brands online. The John Lewis department store group is also expected to announce it made close to no profits in the first half of this year as it struggled to match heavy discounting by its two key rivals. All three are under pressure as the cost of investing in the infrastructure to run competing home delivery operations and websites has come just as department stores are already struggling to cope with increased business rates, wages and a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high street. Patrick O\u2019Brien, UK retail research director at analysis firm GlobalData said: \u2018\u2018Debenhams may still be profitable and has the possibility of bringing in \u00a3200m-plus from the sale of Magasin du Nord, but its long term performance is still going to be under huge pressure, and with it carrying \u00a34.6bn of lease commitments (as of September 2017), both it and its landlords know that these will need to be addressed soon unless there is a marked upturn in the fortunes of the UK high street.\u2019\u2019",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets are still trading higher, while Asian shares saw losses overnight, dragged down by trade tensions \u2013 in particular Chinese stock markets. Beijing reiterated at a regular news briefing that it would retaliate if the US imposed new tariffs. A barrage of better-than-expected data showed the UK was in better shape than thought over the summer. GDP growth accelerated to 0.6% in the three months to July from 0.4% in the three months to June, with retail sales and construction strong while industrial production declined. Economists cautiously welcomed the pick-up but voiced some concerns over the outlook once the World Cup and heatwave effects fade and we get closer to Brexit. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We will be back tomorrow. Sterling has edged higher today following the better-than-expected GDP numbers, although the data were overshadowed by fresh worries over Brexit. The pound has gained 0.2% to $1.2946 after hitting a session high of $1.2954. Last week it tumbled 0.3% against the dollar, its biggest weekly drop in a month. Against the euro, sterling is now flat at 89.43 pence. The struggling department chain Debenhams has issued a statement insisting it won\u2019t go bust - after its share price plummeted 17% this morning, hit by rumours that it was considering mass store closures. It emerged at the weekend that the firm has called in restructuring specialists KPMG to assess its options, including a company voluntary arrangement that would enable it to shut stores and renegotiate rents. The shares are now down 11% at 11.4p. The company said it expects to report pretax profits of \u00a333m this year, within the market range of \u00a331m to \u00a336.5m, excluding one-off costs. It said it had strengthened its financial position to ensure \u201cmaximum flexibility amidst volatile market trading conditions\u201d. \u201cThe early weeks of the new season have shown more positive trends and any sustained upturn would result in a rebound in our profit performance.\u201d Sergio Bucher, the chief executive, said: The market environment remains challenging and underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months.

Here\u2019s a helpful comment from one of our readers on today\u2019s news that the UK economy grew 0.6% between May and July, boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave. European stock markets are trading higher after their weak start to the week. There is some relief over the Italian government\u2019s budget. Investors are increasingly optimistic that the budget will respect EU fiscal rules \u2013 and this is lifting banking stocks across Europe. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has jumped 2.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has risen 1.2%. The FTSE 100 in London is up 0.36%, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group amid the biggest risers. Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.4% ahead and France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.5%. Muhammet Mercan, Turkey economist at ING, said: Strong growth in the first half of this year is attributable to fiscal measures introduced by the government to support private consumption and investment, with increasing capital spending. Given that increased financial volatility is weighing on sentiment, the likely difficulties in external financing, an ongoing uptrend in inflation and already sharp monetary tightening since early 2018 with likely further steps, a strong underperformance in growth could well be seen in the second half, likely turning to negative on a sequential basis. Back to the Turkish economy, whose growth slowed to a 5.2% annualised rate in the second quarter, from 7.4%. The breakdown shows the agricultural sector shrank 1.5% year-on-year, while industry grew 4.3%, construction expanded 0.8% services powered 8% ahead. The Turkish economy is expected to grow 3.3% this year, according to a Reuters poll, below a 5.5% government target. Rabobank\u2019s emerging markets foreign exchange strategist Piotr Matys said: The Turkish economy is widely expected to lose even more momentum in the coming quarters as a result of significant lira depreciation. The lira has lost two-fifths of its value against the dollar this year, amid concerns that the Turkish central bank lacks independence and a diplomatic row with the US. The central bank meets on Thursday \u2013 investors expect it to raise interest rates but the size of any hike will be crucial. Rates were left on hold at July\u2019s meeting, wrongfooting analysts and investors. Data last week showed inflation hit 17.9% in August, the highest rate since late 2003. Here is our full story: PricewaterhouseCoopers have sent us their thoughts on UK GDP. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says: The UK economy continued to pick up momentum, growing by 0.6% in the three months to July. This was the fastest quarterly growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2016 and supports the decision of the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. The hot summer and the World Cup boosted retail spending in June and July, and latest business surveys suggest that positive services sector growth continued in August. But manufacturing output growth has weakened. Looking ahead, however, the long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending. Britain\u2019s trade position also improved in July. The overall trade in goods deficit was the smallest since February, at \u00a39.97bn, according to the ONS. The gap with the EU narrowed to \u00a37.2bn, the lowest since April 2016, while the deficit with the rest of the world shrank to \u00a32.8bn, the smallest since February. Exports rose 2% in July while imports fell 1%. The total trade deficit, including services, shrank to just \u00a3100m in July from \u00a3900m in June \u2013 much better than expected. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, said the bounceback in construction, which was hit hard by the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d during the winter, represented a much-needed boost to confidence in the sector. But he cautioned: Underlying growth remains fragile however, and the real test will be if this can be sustained in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u2019 commitment to new projects over the last two years. In particular, separate figures published by the ONS recently show the lowest level of net migration from the EU since 2012, which has again raised concerns as to how construction will cope with a reduction of a skilled labour supply from the EU post-Brexit. If sustained growth is to be realised, then the industry will need the workforce with the right skills, but this is far from clear at present. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says: While not quite in rude health, the economy does look to have been on the up over the summer with consumers spurred on by some good weather and modest increases in real wages. Export demand also looks to have been a bit more supportive, consistent with some of the survey evidence over the summer. It is still unclear that there is enough momentum here to counteract what feels like a rising tide of uncertainty about Brexit and global trade policy concerns.\u201d Construction output rose 0.5% in July, the biggest rise since last December, while manufacturing fell 0.2%, worse than expected. This was largely due to a decline in pharmaceuticals, which can be volatile, the ONS cautioned. Overall production, which also includes utilities, mining and quarrying, edged up 0.1%. The statistics office\u2019s head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said: Growth in the economy picked up in the three months to July. Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year. However, production fell back, with manufacturing again slipping a little while energy generation and supply fell due to reduced demand. The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level. The biggest contributor to growth was the services sector, which expanded 0.6% in the three months to July, while retail trade grew by 2.1%. The Office for National Statistics highlighted the good weather between May and July, citing Met Office data that this summer was the joint hottest summer in the UK since records began. Construction output jumped 3.3%, largely driven by repair and maintenance work. The production sector, however, weighed on growth, with a 0.5% decline. The UK figures are out. Britain\u2019s economy grew 0.6% in the three months to July, the fastest pace in almost a year and up from 0.4% in the three months to June. It was boosted by the World Cup and the heatwave, which encouraged many people to go out and spend more at pubs and restaurants. In July alone, GDP rose 0.3% compared with June. China\u2019s foreign ministry has reiterated that Beijing will respond if the US announces new tariffs on Chinese goods. On Friday, Donald Trump said he was ready to impose duties on pretty much all Chinese imports into the US. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing: If the US said obstinately clings to its course and takes any new tariff measures against China, then the Chinese side will inevitably take countermeasures to resolutely protect our legitimate rights. The US and China imposed tariffs on $50bn of each other\u2019s goods in early July after trade talks broke down. Trump then threatened tariffs on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, whereupon China unveiled a proposed list of retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of US goods in August. On Friday, Trump talked about another package of duties on $267bn of goods, escalating the trade war. This would include mobile phones, the biggest US import from China, for the first time. The $200bn list includes a broad range of consumer products such as cameras, luggage and vacuum cleaners, along with meat and fish, many metals and commodities. The existing and threatened tariffs cover $517bn of Chinese goods \u2013 which would exceed last year\u2019s imports of $505bn from China. Last week, Apple warned that products made in China, including the Apple Watch and Air Pods headphones, would cost more if Trump went ahead with the first tariff package. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, has sent us his thoughts on Debenhams: A CVA is being talked about, but given the weakness in the share price and the recent acquisition of House of Fraser, we must consider the possibility that Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct \u2013 which has a near 30% stake in Debenhams - will swoop. The rationale for combining the two to create the House of Debenhams is compelling enough. As previously noted, combining the two businesses, reducing overheads and at a stroke removing a key leg of competition, seems like the only viable solution for the two ailing department stores. The fact is the market is screaming for restructuring and consolidation looks a sensible route to take given the well documented structural pressures on the sector. Primark, owned by Associated British Foods, expects to post a 6% rise in sales in the year to 15 September, helped by favourable exchange rates and new store openings. But sales melted away during the summer heatwave in northern Europe, with like-for-like sales down 2%. In the UK, full-year sales are also expected to be 6% ahead while like-for-like growth is set to be 1.5%. Primark said it had ramped up its share of the clothing market. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Primark is slightly more subdued than the last update in early July, with overall LFL sales 2% down, but ABF call out the outperformance of the core UK operation. Primark was held back by sales in \u201cNorthern Europe\u201d, but the operating profit margin recovered well in the second half. In terms of new store expansion, the much-vaunted US operation continues to edge forward (with 9 stores now open), but the highlight is that the new UK site in the old Birmingham Pavilions centre will, at 160,000 sq ft, become the largest store in the whole Primark estate. Aston Martin, the luxury car brand favoured by James Bond, has strengthened its board with several experienced FTSE executives ahead of its planned stock market flotation. Its board will be chaired by former Royal Bank of Scotland director Penny Hughes. Richard Solomons, who ran InterContinental Hotels until last year, will serve as a senior independent director and chair the audit and risk committee. Imelda Walsh, the former HR director of Sainsbury\u2019s who chairs the remuneration committee at transport firm FirstGroup; the former Deutsche Bank and Deloitte director Peter Espenhahn; and Lord Carrington, a director of the Arab British Chambers of Commerce, will also join the Aston Martin board as non-executive directors. The carmaker said it would release further details on the float, such as the indicative price range and the maximum number of shares to be sold, around 20 September. Turning to company news, Debenhams shares have plunged 17% this morning, to 10p. The department store chain called in administrators KPMG over the weekend to assess its options, including a company voluntary arrangement. This \u2013 also used by other retailers recently \u2013 would allow it to close stores and to renegotiate rents at others. The Turkish economy is expected to slow further in the second half, as the country battles with the fallout from its currency crisis. The lira has plummeted, partly due to concerns over president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s influence over monetary policy. Economists say the central bank should raise interest rates to rein in inflation, but Erdo\u011fan has resisted this. The central bank meets on Thursday. The Turkish GDP figures are out. The economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.2% in the second quarter, down from 7.4% in the first quarter, but in line with economists\u2019 expectations. The dollar is rising again amid mounting trade tensions, and the Swedish krona is also up following yesterday\u2019s election. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of six currencies, is 0.13% higher. The Swedish krona rose 0.6% against the euro following the election. Jon Henley reports from Stockholm: Sweden faces a protracted period of political uncertainty after an election that left the two main parliamentary blocs tied but well short of a majority, and the far-right Sweden Democrats promising to wield \u201creal influence\u201d in parliament despite making more modest gains than many had predicted. The populist, anti-immigrant party won 17.6% of the vote, according to preliminary official results \u2013 well up on the 12.9% it scored in 2014, but far below the 25%-plus some polls had predicted earlier in the summer. It looked highly likely, however, to play a significant role as kingmaker. European stock markets have opened slightly lower. FTSE 100 in London down 0.1% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.09% CAC in Paris down 0.05% Ibex in Madrid up 0.08% David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says in his morning note: The trade numbers from Beijing are likely to have struck a nerve with Mr Trump, and given that he thinks the US are winning the trade spat on account of the recent weakness in the Chinese stock market, he is likely to stick to his protectionist line. Beijing said they would retaliate should the US impose fresh tariffs, and traders are fearful they might weaken the yuan or target US firms operating in China. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, warned President Trump that if he continues down the route of protectionism, it could hurt the company\u2019s profits. The tech sector has been the standout performer of the US market this year, but it has come under pressure recently on account of the update last week from Washington DC that tighter regulation would be required for the industry, and in particular social media stocks like Facebook and Twitter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies over trade have deepened further, after China revealed a record trade surplus with the US on Saturday. Customs data showed it jumped to $31.05bn in August from $28.09bn in July, while overall export growth slowed to the slowest pace since March. Donald Trump is yet to activate the threatened fresh tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods imported to the US, but on Friday suggested duties on a further $267bn could be imposed. Hours before his threats, China announced measures to support some of the exporters affected by higher duties. Beijing has warned that it will retaliate, but has limited room to do so. Analysts at JPMorgan said: The overall sense is that the United States will continue to escalate the pressure until China submits to US demands which does not seem likely any time soon. Overall, the impact of tariffs and high levels of uncertainty will both continue to weigh on markets into the end of the year. Asian stocks started the week in the red, falling for the eighth trading day in a row. Chinese stocks were among the biggest losers, with the blue-chip CSI 300 index falling 1.2% and Shanghai\u2019s Composite shedding nearly 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 1.1%. European shares are set for a mixed open. A barrage of figures, all out at 9.30am BST, will shed some light on the health of the UK economy: monthly GDP for July, along with trade, manufacturing and industrial production and construction. Tomorrow we\u2019ll get the latest labour market data. It is also a big data week for the US. And on Thursday, the Bank of England, European Central Bank and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey hold their monthly meetings.

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin has appointed Penny Hughes, a former Coca-Cola executive, as its chair as the luxury carmaker prepares for a \u00a35bn stock market flotation. Andy Palmer, the Aston Martin chief executive, said the appointment of Hughes and a string of other boardroom heavyweights was \u201ca significant milestone in our history and of the successful turnaround of the company\u201d, which has been bankrupt seven times. Aston Martin, which makes sports cars driven by James Bond in many of the 007 films, is planning to float its shares on the London Stock Exchange in October. The eagerly awaited flotation could result in the carmaker entering the FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s most valuable companies. If it does make it into the FTSE 100, Hughes will be one of only seven female chairs of companies in the blue-chip index. Hughes, who has experience on the boards of FTSE 100 firms including Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone and WM Morrison, will also chair Aston Martin\u2019s nomination committee. She spent the bulk of her career at Coca-Cola, where she was president of the company\u2019s UK and Ireland operations. Hughes was the chair of RBS\u2019s remuneration committee when it awarded the then RBS boss Stephen Hester a near-\u00a31m bonus following the bank\u2019s government bailout. Hester later renounced the \u00a3963,000 payment after succumbing to \u201cenormous political pressure\u201d. Hughes defended the bonus payment, saying it was her \u201cresponsibility is to ensure we\u2019ve got talented leadership that feels it is rewarded appropriately for the task they\u2019re doing\u201d. Aston Martin also appointed the former InterContinental Hotels chief executive Richard Solomons, the former Sainsbury\u2019s executive Imelda Walsh, the former Deutsche Bank director Peter Espenhahn, Arab British Chambers of Commerce director Lord Carrington and Tensie Whelan, a professor of business and society at New York University. \u201cThe independent directors will bring significant experience to the board as we prepare to float and deliver fully on our business plan commitments,\u201d Palmer said. Hughes said she had been impressed by the turnaround of the business and excited by its future. \u201cPrivate shareholders have displayed successful long-term stewardship to date and are fully committed, as am I, to transitioning the group, the board and its governance arrangements to those expected of a world-class public company operating from the UK.\u201d Aston Martin, which is majority-owned by investment firms from Italy and Kuwait, plans to float at least 25% of its shares. Eligible employees and customers of the carmaker will be able to apply to buy shares at the offer price. The flotation will be a big test of the appetite of investors to back British companies as very few large IPOs are expected before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019. Palmer has said that Brexit is not a huge concern for the company because it sells relatively few cars in continental Europe and is also used to dealing with tariffs in most of its export markets. However, the company imports about two-thirds of its parts from Europe.",

    "webTitle": "UK growth will slow to 1.3% amid Brexit uncertainty \u2013 KPMG", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in consumer spending and business investment is expected to drag Britain\u2019s growth rate down to just 1.3% this year, dispelling hopes that the UK\u2019s sluggish rate of expansion in the first six months will recover in the second half of the year. According to the consultancy KPMG, Brexit uncertainty will take a bigger toll on the economy than many forecasters, including the Bank of England, expect following a slump in consumer spending from 1.9% last year to 1.2% in 2018 and an even bigger drop in business investment, from 3.4% in 2017 to 0.8% this year. There is little comfort in the report for workers, who have suffered a fall in incomes over the last year as rising wages failed to keep pace with inflation. The report warned that despite growing difficulties finding staff, intense pressures on profit margins and Brexit uncertainties would dictate caution. \u201cIf productivity growth remains at around 1% then, as a basic rule of thumb, we would expect wages to rise by around 3% on average,\u201d KPMG said, giving workers only a small real-terms rise over an inflation rate running at 2.3%. The predictions coincide with figures from the retail industry showing a 1.6% fall in the number of people visiting high street shops in August compared with last year. Retail analysts at the marketing consultancy Springboard said the decline was even sharper than the 0.8% drop recorded in July and showed that the rising cost of the weekly supermarket shop was leaving consumers with little cash left over to buy other items. KPMG said in its quarterly health check of the British economy that uncertainty and risks around Brexit were likely to put a brake on further interest rate rises by the Bank as policymakers remained cautious \u201cduring the critical months ahead\u201d. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), which is chaired by the governor, Mark Carney, meets this week but is not expected to consider a rate rise before November, KPMG said \u2013 and only if Brexit negotiations progress smoothly. \u201cInterest rates are likely be cut to at least 0.25% if negotiations are not successful, with additional measures to be announced by the [Bank of England] to ease any significant pressure on the banking sector,\u201d the report said. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cIf negotiations between the EU and UK result in a relatively friction-free agreement, then growth is likely to remain around 1.4% in the medium term as a result of relatively weak productivity. \u201cIf we see a disorderly Brexit, growth will obviously slow more dramatically. If negotiations end well, the MPC are likely to raise interest rates to 1% at the tail end of 2019. If no deal is reached, the MPC will need to use interest rates to soften the economic impact,\u201d she said. The UK economy grew by 1.7% during 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics. Growth slowed to 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018, recovering to 0.4% in the second quarter. KPMG\u2019s assessment of the housing market found that the average price of a home across the countrywill rise more slowly this year than last \u2013 with growth dropping from 4.5% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018. The slowdown is expected to continue for the rest of the decade \u2013 down to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020. \u201cHigh price levels, uncertainty around the future economic outlook and rising interest rates are expected to take their toll in London and the south-east especially. House prices in the capital are expected to drop by 0.7% in 2019,\u201d it said, with further modest falls in subsequent years. \u201cIn regions with lower pressures on valuations, such as Scotland, there is expected to be growth of 4.9% in 2018,\u201d it said.",

Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction mean the economy is officially in recession.<br></p>\n    <p>GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government.<br></p>\n    <p>Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which shows how the economy is performing once inflation is taken into account.<br></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;Office for National Statistics&nbsp;produces quarterly official GDP figures about three and a half weeks after the end of each three-month period.<br></p>\n    <p>The ONS uses three measures and they should, at least in theory, all add up to the same number.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of all goods and services produced - known as the output or production measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of the income generated from company profits and wages - known as the income measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas - known as the expenditure measure.</p>\n    <p>The ONS publishes three estimates of quarterly GDP figures. The first \"flash\" estimate comes out about 25 days after the quarter in question has ended. The figures usually get revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and government departments is received. But even the third, dubbed \"final\", estimate of quarterly GDP is not set in stone: the Blue Book, which is published once a year, in August, contains revisions going back the last 18 years.<br></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;National Institute of Economic and Social Research's&nbsp;estimate comes out about three weeks before the official figures.<br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p>The ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here.

The total increased by 3,700 in the latest available tax year, but there are concerns that many of the \u201chighly mobile\u201d high-earners could quit the UK in the wake of a messy Brexit. More than a third of all the \u00a31m earners live in London, with more than 2,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, and 1,400 in the City of Westminster in the 2015-16 tax year. That\u2019s according to HMRC figures obtained by the law firm Wilsons under freedom of information laws. The 2015-16 are the latest figures available. Wilsons\u2019 analysis suggests that many of the \u00a31m-plus earners are wealthy foreign executives, investors or non-doms who are domiciled overseas for tax purposes. They could leave the UK if immigration rules or taxes are tightened in the wake of Brexit. Tim Fullerlove, a partner at Wilsons, said: \u201cLondon is still an attractive prospect for the wealthy, but a more welcoming culture in UK policies could help to retain its appeal. \u201cWealthy business executives, investors and non-doms from overseas are a boon for the UK economy, paying large amounts of taxes in the capital and generating jobs. Many high earners regard the UK as one of the most secure countries in which to hold their assets. \u201cThere is now a danger, however, that what some commentators are calling the \u2018golden goose\u2019 of wealthy investors is being taken for granted. \u201cThere could be a risk of losing non-doms to other jurisdictions if UK tax reliefs are not attractive to them. There are also concerns that visa rules could be tightened after Brexit, shutting off investors from overseas.\u201d Non-dom status has been repeatedly criticised, for allowing some of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals to live in Britain for years without paying UK tax on foreign income. Some non-doms have passed the status down between generations, dramatically cutting their tax bills. In 2015, the then-chancellor George Osborne announced a partial clampdown on the practice, hitting non-doms who were born in the UK or had lived in the country for more than 15 of the last 20 years. HMRC figures show that there was a 23% fall in the number of individuals claiming non-dom tax status last year, falling from 118,000 in 2015-16 to 91,000 in 2016-17.",
