He said: \"Although the volatility in global markets persists in 2012, particularly concerning the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, we remain confident in the outlook for our diversified mix of commodities due to sustained growth in emerging markets.\" In January, ENRC agreed to pay $1.25bn to settle a long-running dispute with Canada's First Quantum Minerals over assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ENRC sparked uproar when it bought the Kolwezi copper mining project in the war-ravaged African country. The operation had belonged to First Quantum but it had been seized by the DRC government, which accused the Canadians of contract violations. City analysts said ENRC's action had alienated shareholders and several big investors, including Standard Life, sold their holdings in protest. The agreement was struck on the basis that First Quantum drops all legal claims against the DRC and ENRC; the DRC has also pledged to terminate its claims against First Quantum.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's chances of slipping into recession have receded but the economy still faces threats from sluggish consumer spending, the eurozone crisis and high oil prices, the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned. Publishing their economic outlook alongside George Osborne's budget, the independent forecasters said growth would be slightly stronger than first feared this year but it painted a picture of a slow road to recovery and slashed forecasts for business investment. \"The economy carried a little more momentum into the new year than previously anticipated,\" the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said, raising the 2012 growth forecast to 0.8% from 0.7% pencilled in last November. \"The underlying picture is one in which growth is pretty stable through to the autumn and then picks up towards the end of the year,\" he added, but warned potential output would not be back to its long-term average growth rate until 2014. Despite the new year uptick in activity, the OBR would not go so far as to rule out a technical recession, defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The UK economy shrank in the final months of 2011. It put the chances that the UK economy would shrink this year versus 2011 at \"roughly\" one-in-four. It said the \"key risks\" stemmed from the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone and from a further spike in oil prices, which have already hit $127 a barrel this year. Within the UK, the forecasters warned consumer spending would continue to act as a drag on overall growth and that pressure would not lift until income growth significantly outstrips the pace of inflation in 2014. One of the biggest uncertainties in its growth outlook came from business investment, which the government has been banking on as a key driver in the recovery. After a dismal outturn at the end of last year, business investment growth was slashed to just 0.7% this year from 7.7% predicted back in November. \"We believe that non-financial companies' balance sheets may be weaker than official statistics suggest,\" the OBR said. The outlook was still too punchy for forecasters at the respected thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). \"Continued uncertainty, combined with funding problems in the banking sector, are likely to result in a sharp fall in business investment and a negative contribution from inventory accumulation this year, keeping the economy broadly flat,\" it said. The outlook for unemployment remained bleak with the OBR forecasting the jobless rate would peak at 8.7% this year and edge down only slightly next year to 8.6%. The OBR's latest forecasts for the economy, which it sees growing 2% next year, are slightly more optimistic than those of other forecasters but a little more pessimistic than the latest outlook from the Bank of England. Economists said it was unsurprising the OBR had held off making any big upward revisions to the outlook despite a pick-up in the tone of economic indicators and business surveys in recent weeks. Philip Shaw at Investec commented: \"Has the economic environment not improved since last autumn? At first glance the absence of an upgrade to the macro forecasts might seem inconsistent with the better tone to financial markets so far this year. Arguably though what has changed is that the downside risks facing the world economy have faded, without an appreciable change in the main case outlook.\"",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne scotched rumours in the run-up to Wednesday's's budget that he would splash out the \u00a35-10bn City experts believed he would have to spare in the current financial year, promising instead to use any wriggle room to reduce the government's debts. This morning it became clear why: tax revenues in February were so weak that there was no windfall left. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics just hours before the budget revealed a much larger than expected deficit of more than \u00a315bn last month alone. As Osborne put the finishing touches to his statement, it underlined the tough challenge he faces in meeting his deficit-cutting targets over the next five years. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which published its forecasts for the Treasury's finances alongside the budget, now expects a deficit for 2011-12 as a whole of \u00a3126bn, or 8.3% of GDP, almost unchanged from the \u00a3127bn it was projecting at the autumn statement in November. That will fall to \u00a392bn in the next financial year, the OBR believes, and \u00a321bn, or 1.1% of GDP by 2016-17 as the spending squeeze takes hold in earnest. Wednesday's statement included a batch of high-profile announcements, including a cut in the 50p top tax rate, a faster than expected reduction in corporation tax, and a \u00a31,100 increase in the personal allowance - a package which Osborne promised to help Britain \"earn its way in the world\". But the OBR said the overall impact of these measures would be \"broadly neutral\" over its five year forecasting period, with each giveaway matched by a tax grab somewhere else. Meanwhile Osborne is sticking rigidly to his programme of spending cuts, as much as 80% of which are still to come, according to a recent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"All in all, this was the Budget of small numbers that we had expected to see,\" said Chris Crowe, UK economist at Barclays Capital. Under the OBR's latest forecasts, the national debt is now expected to continue rising, from 67.3% of GDP this year, to peak at 76.3% of GDP in 2014-15, marginally lower than the 78% the OBR had previously expected. It will be falling by 2015-16, in accordance with Osborne's fiscal target, the OBR predicted. It added that the chancellor also had a \"more than 50%\" chance of meeting his other key budget target, of eliminating the \"structural deficit\" - the shortfall in the public finances once the state of the economy is accounted for - over a five year period. The picture is complicated in the short-term by the transfer of Royal Mail's pension fund to the Exchequer, confirmed by Osborne, which the coalition hopes will make the state-owned postal operator a more attractive proposition for a private sector buyer. Public accounting rules mean the scheme's assets are brought onto the books immediately, boosting the finances by \u00a328bn. But it also has longer-term liabilities of \u00a337.5bn, which will eventually more than wipe out those assets as pensions are paid out. Another short-term boost to the exchequer will come from the faster than expected drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, which will save Osborne \u00a3800m next year, and \u00a31.5bn in 2014-15. In line with analysis from HM Revenue, published with the Budget, the OBR said it had slashed its estimate of the yield from the 50p tax rate to \u00a3100m because of widespread avoidance (though it insisted there was \"huge uncertainty\" around these numbers). The projected income from tax on North Sea oil was also revised down, because of lower than expected production.
