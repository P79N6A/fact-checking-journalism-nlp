    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Energy firms 'overcharge by \u00a33.7bn a year'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some of Britain's biggest energy companies have been accused of raising households bills for no reason and systematically overcharging customers by \u00a33.7bn a year as they were grilled by MPs over their soaring prices and profits. They were taken to task by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of small supplier Ovo Energy, who launched a stinging attack on his larger rivals for being \"the best filibusters in the business\" when it comes to revealing how they make their money. After British Gas, npower, SSE and Scottish Power announced inflation-busting increases in household bills, Fitzpatrick said he \"cannot explain any of these price rises\" as his company is buying gas for 7% less than it was two years ago. The four companies that have raised bills in recent weeks are under increasing pressure to justify their higher prices after figures from the regulator Ofgem showed that network costs have risen by just \u00a315 since last year, wholesale costs by \u00a310 and green costs by \u00a310. During the hearing MPs criticised the companies' executives for accepting large bonuses while putting up prices year after year and failing in their duties to protect poor households who have to choose between heating and eating. John Robertson, a Labour MP, warned that thousands of people were dying of hypothermia because they could not afford to pay their bills. He dismissed the companies' claims that they do not disconnect customers by pointing out that those who fall into debt are moved on to prepayment meters which in effect force them to \"self-disconnect\". \"The big reason is they die of hypothermia and they can't afford to keep the heating on. By the time you have gone to look for them [after 30 days of no energy] it's too late,\" he said. The four major companies that have raised prices blamed a combination of rising wholesale prices, green levies and network costs for their latest round of \u00a3100-plus increases, taking the average bill to \u00a31,315 a year. They said they could cut prices per household by \u00a340 to \u00a360 instantly if the government removed a charge for the ECO \u2013 Energy Companies Obligation \u2013 scheme to help poorer households cut their energy usage, with E.ON calling it a \"stealth poll tax\" and SSE saying putting it on bills was \"morally wrong\". Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, even called for a competition inquiry into the market to clear the energy firms of any allegations of profiteering once and for all. Cocker also said Labour's promise of a price freeze \"at a stroke has increased the long-term cost of electricity and gas supply in this country\". However, Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, dismissed the claims of the Big Six energy companies as excuses and said he would take action against those that are \"overcharging people and taking advantage of a broken market\" by freezing prices and breaking up the firms if he wins power in 2015. Fitzpatrick said he was \"somewhat confused by looking at the explanations for the price rises over the past three or four weeks because we do not see really the same impact, especially in wholesale commodity prices. \"We buy all of our power and gas on the wholesale market and \u2026 the most expensive price we have paid for wholesale gas in the last four years was in May 2011, for the following winter \u2013 that was 74p a therm. \"Since then it has been below 72p a therm for this winter, last winter and next winter. We are buying gas for next winter at a current price of 69p a therm.\" He laid into RWE npower for being the \"worst offender\" in terms of offering some of the most expensive tariffs, and British Gas for its tactic of swiftly offering people much cheaper prices when they say they are about to switch supplier. He said the big companies could easily get round MPs' questions with \"very complex, very clever, very confusing answers\", adding: \"You'll never get to the bottom of it.\" He added: \"We are all trying to track were the money has gone, and you will never find it.\" Some of the big companies offer cheaper fixed-rate deals than Ovo and other small suppliers, but these are only taken up by a minority of savvy customers. Millions of British households are on the most expensive tariffs, which cost up to \u00a3150 more \u2013 or \u00a33.7bn in total \u2013 than the prices that Ovo claims accurately reflect the costs of supplying energy with a 5% profit margin. Sitting next to representatives of E.ON, npower and SSE, Fitzpatrick said it was also \"common practice among several of our competitors that they load the environmental and social obligation costs on to those customers that are less likely to leave. It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers. \"In the case of npower, which is the worst offender, historically and today the price differential is about 16%, which is about \u00a3200. That's more than the increase we have seen.\" Turning to his rivals' sales practices, Fitzpatrick complained that \"one in five customers joining today are immediately leaving to go back to the previous supplier because of a win-back inducement that can be up to 15% off the bill\". He said: \"When a customer calls their supplier and says I'm going to leave, they say hold on a moment, we've just found out we can save you \u00a3160. British Gas seems to be the most active, with a dedicated win-back team whose sole job it is to call people up and there's a terrible mistake, we've been overcharging you all this time and now we can cut your bill. When this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchallenged, this ex-monopoly advantage by the Big Six goes unchallenged by Ofgem, we'll never get effective competition.\" Andrew Wright, interim chief executive officer of Ofgem, said it was \"absolutely right\" that there should be a debate about its powers to regulate the industry and promised an annual competition review, but his evidence to MPs was cut short by a parliamentary vote in the Commons.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's postal system faces severe disruption next week when thousands of Post Office staff join Royal Mail workers in a co-ordinated strike. Up to 4,000 workers in hundreds of the UK's main post offices will strike on Monday over issues of pay, branch closures and job cuts in the latest round of a long-running dispute. For the first time since Post Office workers began this series of strikes they will be joined by Royal Mail workers, who are seeking agreements from the newly privatised service in a separate dispute. Adding to the potential disruption they will be joined by up to 1,500 Post Office support staff, including cash-van drivers, striking against a pay freeze. The Communication Workers' Union predicted the coordinated action would cause far greater disorder than any of the previous dozen strikes by its members at the 372 crown post offices, the network's large town-centre branches. Dave Ward, CWU's deputy general secretary, said: \"We are coordinating strike action across postal companies for 4 November to increase the impact of the action and try and focus the minds of company negotiators. \"The company is unfairly imposing pay freezes on both crown staff and now admin and supply chain workers, while senior managers have enjoyed significant bonus payments. These double standards cannot continue and we hope to make progress in talks this week.\" Previous rounds of Post Office strikes caused widespread branch closures and long queues outside those premises which did open as managers struggled to provide a skeleton service. Even if branches are kept open, customers will not be able to post parcels, and a lack of cash-van drivers could cause offices to run low on money, the CWU said. The announcement came as shares in Royal Mail closed at \u00a35.34, up more than 60% from their float price of \u00a33.30, valuing the company at more than \u00a35bn. Last week it emerged that one of the company's biggest shareholders is a combative hedge fund \u2013 the Children's Investment fund, which has been branded a \"locust\" in Germany and which holds more than 5% of the company. Monday's action will be the Post Office workers' 13th one-day strike since Easter Saturday over a pay freeze and over plans to close or franchise out 75 offices while cutting up to 1,500 jobs. The industrial action by up to 115,000 Royal Mail and Parcelforce workers on the same day will be the first national strike since 2009. It will hit deliveries, collections and other facilities such as sorting, logistics and call centres, the CWU said. The union said crown Post Offices workers had voted nine-to-one in favour of the strike; they had not had a pay rise since April 2011 while other Post Office members had received increases totalling 6.75% and top managers had enjoyed big paydays. The Post Office said that most crown branches had opened on previous strike days and that its 11,500 smaller branches would not be affected. But the union said the main branches handled 20% of customers and 40% of financial services sales, and that services such as currency exchange would not be available in many branches staying open. The Post Office said it was investing in the crown branches and that plans to franchise out some of the offices would not cause closures or compulsory job losses. A spokesperson for the Post Office said: \"The union are calling for an above-inflation pay agreement when last year our overall performance was a loss of \u00a3116m. We must reverse this loss of public money. \"CWU have refused their members a fair and affordable pay offer of cash payments totalling up to \u00a33,400 by April 2015. \"Strike action can only cost our people money, cause disruption to customers and threaten our plans to turn the business around and keep our branches on high streets and in city centres across the UK.\"",

Ofgem hired BDO accountancy firm to advise on financial reporting of energy companies, but then failed to take up its recommendations, arguing they would put unnecessary burdens on the big six.</p> <p>MPs rejected this argument in their <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmenergy/108/10802.htm\">report on energy prices, profits and poverty</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe that taken as a whole, the benefits of BDOs recommendations - in terms of improvements to transparency and comparability of the statements and associated improvements in consumer trust - significantly outweigh any burdens on the six largest vertically integrated energy companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>We recommend that Ofgem should require the six largest vertically integrated companies to implement BDO' recommendations 1 (publishing statements to the same year-end), 2 (independent auditor opinion on statements), and 4(reporting of trading function results).

However, mortgage approvals are still below pre-crisis levels, with monthly approvals averaging above 100,000 in 2006 and 2007.</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK economist at<strong> IHS Global Insight</strong>, had this to say on the Bank's data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The marked increase in mortgage approvals in September provides compelling evidence that housing market activity was already gaining appreciable momentum even before the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme came into being in early October.</p> <p>While the strength of house price rises in London is becoming an increasing concern and pushing up the overall national increase in house prices, we are currently a long way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially ifalready significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme</p> <p>It is therefore of vital importance that policymakers closely monitor the situation and are prepared to act quickly and decisively if signs of the housing market overheating become increasingly widespread and pronounced.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> also revealed that lending to non-financial companies&#xa0;rose by \u00a3720m in September., following a \u00a33.7m fall in August.</p> <p>However, while lending to large companies increased by \u00a31.1bn, loans to small and medium-sized enterprises fell by \u00a3383m. </p> <p><strong>Adam Marshall,</strong> director of policy and external affairs at the<strong> British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, said more help was needed for SMEs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s good to see overall business lending rise, as this has an impact on business confidence. Yet these new figures show that while large firms have little difficulty tapping debt markets, SMEs \u2013 and particular young, fast-growing firms \u2013 continue to struggle to access growth capital.</p> <p>Both policy-makers and financial institutions need to do more to help fast-growing SMEs access finance. The British Business Bank has a huge role to play here, and should be enhanced with additional capital to help plug the gap.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:42:49.868Z\">at 1.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526f8169e4b0ffc73763b618\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T09:47:50.222Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets are up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The major European markets are all slightly higher this morning:</p> <p><strong>FTSE 100</strong>: +0.36% at 6,749.05</p> <p><strong>CAC 40</strong>: +0.17% at 4,258.99</p> <p><strong>DAX 30</strong>: +0.07% at 8,985.04</p> <p><strong>IBEX</strong>: +0.55% at 9,789.2</p> <p><strong>FTSE MIB</strong>: +1.3% at 19,073.95</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> is the biggest riser on the <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, with shares up 5% at 475p.</p> <p>The company is flying high after a better than expected set of third-quarter results which included a dividend hike and a plegde to return proceeds of asset sales to shareholders.

Quick summary: Energy bosses defended their price increases and argued for green levies to be moved off customers' bills and into general taxation. Tony Cocker of E.ON said he had called on the prime minister to launch a competition investigation. I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to have a very thorough competition commission investigation. Andrew Wright of Ofgem said the regulator had launched \"the most significant reforms\" since competition was introduced. John Robertson for Labour accused the companies of failing to protect their most vulnerable customers. There are thousands of people dying because of government policy... and the big reason is they die of hypothermia because they can't afford to put the heating on. To just say you move them on to prepayment because they cannot afford to protect their bills, sorry, you need to do more to protect them. That's all from me today. Thank you for following and join us tomorrow for more rolling news on the Guardian business blog. Over on the Spectator's Coffee House blog, Isabel Hardman sounds underwhelmed by MPs' performance in taking on the energy bosses: \"the energy companies have hardly had the grilling they were expecting: more of a gentle warming.\" She writes that the person who has done the most to make the big six witnesses uncomfortable is one of the other witnesses: Stephen Fitzpatrick, the managing director of Ovo Energy. He took apart those sitting next to him in the Thatcher Room, saying that Ovo couldn\u2019t see the prices on the wholesale market that would lead to the sort of rises that the Big Six have been announcing recently. John Rentoul at the Independent also thinks that the MPs failed to inflict \"ritual cathartic humiliation\". Normal people don\u2019t have to sit through select committee meetings, but I suspect that most of us have an understanding of market economics that works at two levels. Level one is that prices seem to go up a lot, don\u2019t seem to go down when world prices go down, and that the bosses of a lot of companies seem to get paid an awful lot, which doesn\u2019t seem to go down if their companies do badly. But level two is that nationalising the energy industry would not make gas and electricity bills magically cheaper. Still waiting for MPs to return to the Thatcher room to wrap up this session on the 'big six' with Ofgem's chief executive. So time for a quick backgrounder: earlier this year the committee accused Ofgem of failing to improve transparency in the energy market. Ofgem hired BDO accountancy firm to advise on financial reporting of energy companies, but then failed to take up its recommendations, arguing they would put unnecessary burdens on the big six. MPs rejected this argument in their report on energy prices, profits and poverty: We believe that taken as a whole, the benefits of BDOs recommendations - in terms of improvements to transparency and comparability of the statements and associated improvements in consumer trust - significantly outweigh any burdens on the six largest vertically integrated energy companies. We recommend that Ofgem should require the six largest vertically integrated companies to implement BDO' recommendations 1 (publishing statements to the same year-end), 2 (independent auditor opinion on statements), and 4(reporting of trading function results). We also encourage Ofgem to consider requiring implementation of BDO's recommendations in full and to publish, in its response to this report, its analysis of the cost to energy companies of full implementation. With MPs calling Ofgem \"a paper tiger\", it is not only the big six energy bosses that are attempting to defend their reputations today. The division bell is ringing again. Short break while MPs go off to vote. Alan Whitehead is asking about the BDO recommendations (see 4.08 for background). Wright says Ofgem has committed to looking again at those recommendations and will be coming out with a call for evidence and \"engaging with stakeholders\". We have led the way in improving transparency in this market.. without the actions we took this debate would not be possible. This should be seen as Ofgem's defence, after the same group of MPs criticised the regulator for dismissing the BDO report, a series of recommendations to improve transparency. One MP thinks a different energy market model could work better: why not have \"fierce competition\" in generating electricity, but have co-operatively owned business model to supply consumers. Wright says there are many different models of running energy systems throughout the world. \"It is the government's policy to have a competitive market in the supply of retail and gas.\" Sounding non specific (to my ears), Wright says the regulator has a range of powers to ensure the market is working properly. Andrew Wright says the regulator is introducing the \"most significant reforms\" since competition was introduced that will make a real difference to consumers and suppliers. Worth a quick reminder that earlier this year the committee criticised Ofgem for not doing enough to ensure companies were open and transparent. You can read the full report here. Now in the final session MPs are quizzing Andrew Wright, the interim chief executive officer of regulator Ofgem. He starts by promising an annual review of market competition starting next spring. And on that note, part two is over, with the feed cutting our abruptly... Ian Peters confirms to Labour MP Ian Lavery that British Gas made \u00a31.08 bn pre tax profits last year. John Robertson (Lab) accuses the companies of not doing enough to protect people in fuel poverty. There are thousands of people dying because of government policy... and the big reason is they die of hypothermia because they can't afford to put the heating on. To just say you move them on to prepayment because they cannot afford to protect their bills, sorry you need to do more to protect them. The executives all say they will do more... John Robertson is asking about \"excessive\" charges for sending out letters and disconnecting customers. He says when indebted customers are moved onto prepayment metres, they are being \"disconnected by the back door\". Ian Peters of British Gas says it is a responsible way for these customers to repay debts. He claims British Gas is the only energy company checking to make sure these customers are not cut off. Martin Lawrence says EDF hasn't made its mind up yet on whether it plans to raise prices. Ramsay Dunning of Co-operative Energy, says the energy sector has a perception problem. It looks like an oligopoly. He doesn't think it is, but argues that potential new market entrants are deterred by lack of market transparency. I am not asking for the breakup of the big six, but we need to do something to change that appearance. He argues that power generation and retail supply of energy to households should be split. This \"vertical integration\" feeds the perception of an uncompetitive industry. Alan Whitehead, Labour, wants to know why 'big six' energy company price rises march in step. Ian Peters of British Gas says 2013 is an unusual year, partly because of the introduction of the eco-levy. Neil Clitheroe of Scottish Power takes up the eco levy tax argument, saying the UK is one of the few countries that puts the charge on bills. \"If that separate people we could reference that point straight away and say that's what we pay.\" JR -This is emerging as the line-to-take for the energy companies today. Martin Lawrence of EDF chips in, asking for more stability and clarity about the future of the green levy. Now Ian Peters of British Gas argues that the eco levy should be shifted into general taxation, rather than put on customers' bills. Christopher Pincher (Conservative), citing research from the Institute of Public Policy Research, says that 1/3 of British Gas price hike could be avoided if they delivered on energy efficiency. Peters says he doesn't understand where that analysis comes from. Ian Peters of British Gas says 1% of the fall in customers' energy use is not related to energy efficiency measures, suggesting this could be related to changing habits. Clitheroe is saying energy efficiency measures are leading to reductions in consumption. But one MP want to know how much of that consumption drop is because people cannot afford to heat their homes. Clitheroe says that is difficult to answer. The last round of questions on the renewable obligation didn't elicit much substance from anyone. Now Christopher Pincher (Conservative) picks up the green levies again. Neil Clitheroe is setting out how Scottish Power accounts for its recent \u00a398 cost increase: including a \u00a333 rise in wholesale prices and a \u00a320 increase in environmental and social costs. Questioned why the rise in wholesale prices is greater than their competitors, he refers to the spike in gas prices last winter. Back up and running again with the wholesale market price for gas under scrutiny. Ramsay Dunning of Co-op Energy, which recently put up prices by 4.5% for its 150,000 customers, explains why their costs are rising more slowly than for the rest. He says they do not bear the full amount of eco costs that the big six do, however neither does the Co-Op benefit from economies of scale. And he adds: We can sustain ourselves on lower levels of profitability Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green party, has given her reaction to today's committee meeting: It's excellent that senior executives are 'facing the music' before MPs today, but what we need on energy policy is not uncomfortable squirms but effective action. \"MPs are right to ask why energy prices have gone up by 9% on average when wholesale gone up by 1.7% this year, but what we really need are answers as to how we can have affordable energy bills in future, warm comfortable homes and an energy industry that provides a range of jobs and economic opportunities for Britain. That means we need a serious focus on energy conservation, particularly home insulation, to end the scandal exposed today by the Children Society of the more than half of the 3 million children living in poverty who say their home is uncomfortably cold, and the 26% who say their home suffers from mould or damp. A quick recap for anyone just joining us: senior executives at nPower (RWE) and SSE have defended their price rise policy, claiming it was unavoidable because rises in the wholesale price of gas. E.ON refused to rule out a price rise. All three denied working in concert and insisted they ran transparent companies. Energy minnow Ovo Energy, which has 140,000 customers, pleaded for more competition and said it could cut customers' bills if it was in the position of RWE. A snap verdict: no MP has landed a killer blow, but they are clearly not buying the energy companies' arguments. The Thatcher room in Portcullis House, where energy bosses are meeting MPs, is still looking pretty empty. It seems appropriate this debate about energy prices - effectively a debate about the effectiveness of competition started by Margaret Thatcher - is happening here. The division bell is ringing and members are off to vote. Should be back in 10 minutes, says the committee chair. Ian Peters of British Gas defends the difference between his firm's 9.2% increase in wholesale costs, when Ofgem showed that wholesale prices were going up by much less. He says that this is comparing apples with bananas, because the Ofgem figures are forward-looking. Ramsay Dunning of Co-op Energy says his energy firm is run in a very different way from the big six. Now up is Neil Clitheroe of Scottish Power, who is defending his company's 8.6% price rise. He says it is \"extremely difficult to make these decisions\" and tells Owen his bonus has been flat for the past few years. Owen \"You are comfortable taking bonuses when your customers are struggling?\" Clitheroe says he is not comfortable with what is happening to his customers. Peters says that Sam Laidlaw, Centrica boss, is getting a bonus because the company is making profits by expanding overseas. Owen: \"You don't lead by example. The rest of the country is struggling wage freezes.\" Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas, steps up for this question. He says executive remuneration is a bigger issue than just the energy issue and bonuses are set by an independent committee. \"It is very transparent and the terms are put to our remuneration committee every year.\" Owen sounds unimpressed by this argument. Since 2008 the average British Gas bill has gone up by 38%, while the chief executive of Centrica - who is not here today - had a rise of 36%, up to \u00a32.35m, he says. \"That is the question I am asking, how do you justify that?\" First up, Albert Owen (Lab): \"How can you justify when people are struggling and inflation is at 2-2.5%, how can you justify these rises and give your executives huge pay rises? \"Don't you think that the restraint that the British public is under should apply to your executives as well?\" Owen says he is a customer for British Gas, but he might not be for much longer. And on that note, the first session is wrapping up.. next up Scottish Power, British Gas, EDF and Co-op Energy. Fitzpatrick calls on his competitors \"to treat every customer fairly\". He says if energy companies want to be trusted, you shouldn't be able to save 16% moving from one tariff from another, where profit margins are 5%. \"Everytime they call up to complain, they get a deal dangled in front of them.\" Now it is Guy Johnson's turn to defend nPower's transparency record. He concedes that customers should have \"fewer tariffs, clearer bills\". William Morris of SSE defends his company's record on transparency and says they plan to act on recommendations from accountancy firm BDO to make improvements. The energy and climate change committee called on the firms to act on this report in a report earlier this year. Read the background on transparency recommendations here. Dan Byles, a Conservative MP, says he is none the wiser about energy companies' structure and profits. \"Would you accept that your accounting and reporting practices fail the basic tests of transparency?\" Tony Cocker is defending E.ON's profit margins and return on capital. In Germany, E.ON recently closed a gas-fired power station. Morris of SSE chips in and says they also have concerns about some of their gas-fired power stations in Germany. Phillip Lee says he is puzzled about why generation is not more profitable, when people cannot simply decide not to use gas and electricity. He adds\" If governments go down the energy efficiency route, it is going to screw your business isn't it?\" Fitzpatrick of Ovo Energy is picking up his theme of more competition. He says Ofgem have \"almost entirely failed in our lifetime.\" His firm is four years old. The latest energy market review does almost nothing to address the monopoly position that the big six enjoy. If all the energy companies charged the same prices as Ovo, there would be a \u00a33.7bn saving for consumers. Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP, wants to know how many of the firms employed public relations companies before coming in. \"There is a suspicion that you are a chorus line acting in concert.\" Ian Lavery, a Labour MP, is on the attack about fuel poverty and profits. \"How can these profits be fair when people cannot afford to pay for their energy?\" William Morris of SSE insists that the industry's profit margins are lower than the supermarkets, but adds \"I do accept the point it is still a big number.\" Tony Cocker of E.ON says he has written for to the prime minister calling for a competition inquiry. He says that he fundamentally believes the market is competitive, but acknowledges they are not trusted. \"It would be really helpful to de-politicise this debate, get experts to look at it and sort it out once and for all.\" A question to Fitzpatrick of Ovo Energy: \"If I was to give you half of RWE's business could you do it better and make it cheaper?\" Fitzpatrick says he would be delighted to, saying that RWE /nPower is responsible for highest bills. We are all trying to track were the money has gone and you will never find it. These companies are the best filibusters in the business. But he rejects Robertson's idea that the energy companies should have their generation arms hived off from retail. He argues the biggest problem is lack of competition. \"Effective competition is the only solution to lower bills.\" Will you promise not to cut elderly and disabled people off in the winter even if they do not pay their bills, Robertson asks. The energy bosses are saying nobody gets cut off. Robertson is still unhappy about the lack of transparency over big six profits. According to Ofgem, energy companies make 23% profit on generating electricity while their own figures suggest profits 17-23%, he says. Yet these profits are not taken into account by their retail arms, when companies raise consumers' bills. Why? How can shareholders get dividends on 20% energy generation profits, while consumers get 10% increases in their energy bills he asks. Guy Johnson of nPower says the firm has taken \u00a3170m in subsidies for renewable energy in the last few years, \"vastly dwarfed by the \u00a32.3bn we have invested\". John Robertson (Labour) wants to know where these companies are paying taxes. Tony Cocker of E.On replies: I assume therefore that the German company pays German taxes and the British company pays British taxes. Robertson I would expect a CEO to know... Cocker We pay taxes here in the UK and we are proud to pay taxes in the UK... Robertson You are not trying hard enough... John Robertson for Labour gets to the heart of the matter: Do you understand that the people in this country do not trust you? How do you expect to get that trust back? William Morris (NPower) says 15 months ago he was one of those people. He is a newcomer to the energy industry. We have a profound problem on our hands. Albert Owen, Labour, is also asking about the eco levies, pointing out they were only introduced in April. \"Many of my constituents don't have the luxury of those discounts because they don't have a dual-fuel bill,\" he adds. So why should they have to pay more? If the green levies are lifted will you pass on the saving to your customers, asks Pincher (Con) referring to David Cameron's pledge to roll back green levies. \"Unquestionably yes,\" says Johnson of nPower. \"Pound for pound, penny for penny, that should come straight off the customer's bill.\" Tony Cocker of E.ON is not giving a yes or no answer. Christopher Pincher, a Conservative member of the committee, is asking nPower's Guy Johnson why their eco levy costs are higher than their competitors. We will do absolutely everything in our interest to deliver them as efficiently as possible. Johnson says fuel poverty is profoundly worrying for him. \"We don't want anybody to be in that situation.\" Back onto the eco levies, Guy Johnson of nPower says the scheme add up to \u00a360 on the bill. Tony Cocker of E.ON, which has not yet raised its prices, says the firm has not yet decided if it will raise its prices. \"We will hold our prices as long as we can.\" This doesn't impress the committee - one MP says \"it means nothing \". Cocker blames the green levies, describing them as \"a regressive poll tax\". Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of the committee, is going after the companies on their price rises, and why despite different strategies they all put up their prices at the same time. William Morris of SSE counters \"things are changing\". He says the firm has made a loss of \u00a321m. Tony Cocker claims E.ON has invested \u00a37bn in the last five years. \"There is some misinformation that investment has stalled in the last five years, that isn't what I am hearing.\" He goes on to claim they have invested 100% of what they have earned in the last 5 years. Stephen Fitzpatrick of Ovo Energy says in January 2012 they were the first energy company to announce a price cut. Although it is worth pointing out this cut was wiped out in the following April with a price rise of 5.8%... Guy Johnson of nPower is being quizzed about profits and whether UK profits are being fed back to the home company. nPower is owned by German utility RWE. He insists \"there is no old fashioned transfer pricing going on\", but acknowledges \"an element of concern and suspicion.. that there are excess profits\". Tony Cocker of E.ON denies the charge that companies are subsidising their retail business. He says his business is very transparent. Stephen Fitzpatrick continues his attack on the big six: \"A significant number of the big six are charging the maximum they can get away with.\" Now up Stephen Fitzpatrick from energy minnow Ovo Energy, based in Bristol with 140,000 customers. I cannot explain any of these prices rises. They are not the prices we see in the liquid wholesale market. Like some of the committee members I have been somewhat confused looking at the explanations for some of the price rises. Morris of SSE is getting grilled over the breakdown of SSE's costs. The wholesale energy proportion of the bill is half the bill, another large proportion is transporting energy, the cost of social and environmental schemes account for 10% of bills and have gone up 13%. \"We would like to see those costs off customer bills and coming out of taxation.\" He says he is paying the same proportion of his income on these levies as someone living in fuel poverty, which \"clearly isn't morally defensible\". William Morris of SSE says that OFGEM have revised their position and says company \"regrets profoundly\" having to put up prices. \"None of us want prices to rise.\" First question is on prices, how can they be explained when Ofgem says wholesale prices have only risen by 1.7%? We are getting started... introductions from E.ON, SSE, NPower and Ovo Energy Some background reading: The BBC has put together this handy explainer on the Big Six The Guardian's energy editor Terry Macalister has set out 5 questions they must answer. Here is a full run down of the agenda. As my colleague Jill Treanor has pointed out, it's worth noting that only E.ON have bothered to put up their UK chief executive. Panel 1 at 2.30pm Tony Cocker, Chief Executive Officer, E.ON William Morris, Managing Director, SSE Guy Johnson, External Affairs Director, RWEnpower Stephen Fitzpatrick, Managing Director, Ovo Energy Panel 2 at 3.30pm Neil Clitheroe, Chief Executive Officer - Retail and Generation, ScottishPower Ian Peters, Managing Director - Energy, British Gas Martin Lawrence, Managing Director - Energy Sourcing and Customer Supply, EDF Energy Ramsay Dunning, Group General Manager, Co-operative Energy Panel 3 at 4.30pm Andrew Wright, Interim Chief Executive Officer, Ofgem Interest in the select committee hearing seems to be huge. Hi Jennifer Rankin taking over from Angela Monaghan. Now moving to one of the most keenly-anticipated event of the day. Energy bosses from the \u2018big six\u2019 energy companies, will shortly appear before the energy and climate change select committee. Energy chief executives are about as popular as bankers, so this should be a charged session. A quick recap: Sir Robert Smith, the Lib Dem chair of the committee, asked the energy companies to appear last week after a wave of price increase. NPower, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power have all said they will increase electricity and gas prices by between 8% and 10.4% while Eon and EDF are expected to follow suit. The increases will take the cost of an average dual-fuel bill to more than \u00a31,400 a year. You can follow the session starting at 2.30 here US consumer confidence dropped to 71.2 on the Conference Board's October index, from 80.2 in September (revised from 79.7). Economists had forecast a much more modest fall to 75. US markets have opened up: Dow Jones: +0.32% at 15,618.58 S&amp;P 500: +0.27% at 1,766.90 Nasdaq: +0.05% at 3,384.39 Weak car sales were a drag in September, pushing overall retail sales down 0.1% on a monthly basis. It wasn't far off economists' prediction of flat sales. Excluding cars, retail sales actually rose by a 0.4%, and sales were 3.2% higher compared with September 2012. Economists said it was difficult to get too excited about the numbers because they related to the period before the US government shutdown. James Knightley of ING said: We have to remember that this was a pre-government shutdown figure and so its usefulness as a guide for Federal Reserve policy is limited. Europe's major indices are still higher. FTSE 100: +0.61% at 6,766.38 CAC 40: +0.5% at 4,272.78 DAX 30: +0.18% at 8,995.09 IBEX: +1.11% at 9,844.6 FTSE MIB: +1.75% at 19,158 London traders returned to their desks today after Britain's worst storm in a decade. While travel was severely disrupted and hundreds of thosands of homes lost power, economics editor Larry Elliot believes the economic impact will be limted. He argues: There are good reasons for expecting Britain's growth rate to slow down as 2013 draws to a close but the storm that has battered the south of England is not one of them. To be sure, a complete shutdown of the country would have an impact on national output, as was illustrated by the blizzards in December 2010. They had a material impact on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of that year because the disruption was widespread and protracted. But that's not going to be the case this time. Firstly, the storm passed quickly and the Met Office gave plenty of warning that the bad weather was coming so people planned to work from home. Secondly, many workers were off anyway because of school half-term holidays. Thirdly, many of those who had an unexpected day off will have spent money in shops and restaurants. Finally, the fact that the bad weather came in October \u2013 the first month of the fourth quarter of 2013 \u2013 means there will be plenty of time to make up for lost output. There will have been some loss of output as a result of the bad weather, but at the most it will have shaved 0.1 points off GDP in the fourth quarter, and probably less than that. Katie Allen, the Guardian's economics reporter, tells how the biggest rise in UK mortgage approvals since February 2008 is \"fanning fears\" of a fresh housing market bubble: Mortgages approved by British lenders jumped to their highest level for more than five years in September, fanning fears the housing market was already heating up even before the latest government support kicked in. Banks, building societies and other lenders approved 66,735 mortgages in September, the biggest monthly total since February 2008, before the global financial crisis took hold. The figures, from the Bank of England, were just ahead of City forecasts for 66,000 and compared with an upwardly revised 63,396 in August. Mortgage approvals are seen by economists as a good early indicator of where the housing market is headed. They follow government data on Monday showing house prices rose in every English region in September and are likely to be seized on by those who argue that the government's Help to Buy scheme risks creating a new bubble. Read the full story here. Lenders from the International Monetary Fund, European Union, and European Central Bank - the so-called Troika - will pay a final visit to Dublin today. It follows the bailout which Ireland was forced into following the near collapse of its banking system at the height of the financial crisis. The country is hoping to become the first to exit the rescue programme. This from our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald, in Dublin: Officials from the International Monetary Fund, the EU and the European Bank will make their 12th and final visit to the Irish capital today to review the Republic's economy as heads towards exiting the bail out. The so-called Troika will examine the progress Ireland is making towards driving down its national debt and moving to restoring economic sovereignty. Ireland will become the first country in the EU to leave the bail out programme. The Republic was forced to borrow 67.5bn euros (\u00a357.4bn) after its biggest banks almost collapsed in November 2010. However, the state's debt-to-GDP ratio is still around 120% and Irish banks have yet to properly deal with the tens of thousands of its customers in mortgage arrears. Meanwhile, unemployment remains more than 14 per cent of the workforce. Our City Editor Jill Treanor is following the session live and tweeting here. Barry Tootell, former chief executive of the bank, has told MPs that the downgrade to junk status by Moody's in May was more severe than expected. He has also denied misleading the market about the state of the bank. See here for a great read on the Co-op fiasco. Turning to Spain, retail sales rose by 2.2% in September compared with the same month a year earlier. It followed a 4.8% drop in August according to official figures, and marked the first annual rise in more than three years. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, puts the rise into context on Twitter: UK mortgage approvals for house purchases (i.e. excluding remortgages) rose 5.3% to 66,735 in September, from 63,396 in August. It was the highest level since February 2008, before the global financial crisis intensified in September that year with the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The Bank of England data will be taken as a further sign that Britain's housing market was warming up even before the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme was introduced earlier this month. However, mortgage approvals are still below pre-crisis levels, with monthly approvals averaging above 100,000 in 2006 and 2007. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, had this to say on the Bank's data: The marked increase in mortgage approvals in September provides compelling evidence that housing market activity was already gaining appreciable momentum even before the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme came into being in early October. While the strength of house price rises in London is becoming an increasing concern and pushing up the overall national increase in house prices, we are currently a long way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging. Nevertheless, there is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially ifalready significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme It is therefore of vital importance that policymakers closely monitor the situation and are prepared to act quickly and decisively if signs of the housing market overheating become increasingly widespread and pronounced. The Bank of England also revealed that lending to non-financial companies rose by \u00a3720m in September., following a \u00a33.7m fall in August. However, while lending to large companies increased by \u00a31.1bn, loans to small and medium-sized enterprises fell by \u00a3383m. Adam Marshall, director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce, said more help was needed for SMEs: It\u2019s good to see overall business lending rise, as this has an impact on business confidence. Yet these new figures show that while large firms have little difficulty tapping debt markets, SMEs \u2013 and particular young, fast-growing firms \u2013 continue to struggle to access growth capital. Both policy-makers and financial institutions need to do more to help fast-growing SMEs access finance. The British Business Bank has a huge role to play here, and should be enhanced with additional capital to help plug the gap. The major European markets are all slightly higher this morning: FTSE 100: +0.36% at 6,749.05 CAC 40: +0.17% at 4,258.99 DAX 30: +0.07% at 8,985.04 IBEX: +0.55% at 9,789.2 FTSE MIB: +1.3% at 19,073.95 BP is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, with shares up 5% at 475p. The company is flying high after a better than expected set of third-quarter results which included a dividend hike and a plegde to return proceeds of asset sales to shareholders. It plans to sell $10bn (\u00a36.2bn) of assets by the end of 2015. MPs on House of Commons select committees are in for a busy day. The main event starts at 2.30 in the Thatcher Room, Portcullis House, when the Big Six energy companies will be grilled on prices by the energy and climate change committee. I think they can expect some fairly robust questioning following the intense debate about rising UK energy bills. First we had Labour Ed Miliband, who pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months should his party be elected at the next election. Then came the prices rises. Four of the Big Six - SSE, British Gas, npower and Scottish Power - moved in quick succession, with some customers facing price hikes of more than 10% just in time for winter. MPs will no doubt try to get to the bottom of what is really happening to wholesale energy prices, and how they affect household bills. As Rowena Mason, The Guardian's political correspondent, reports: Some of Britain's big six energy companies have seen their wholesale electricity costs fall over the last three years while still putting up prices for millions of households. The figures will put yet more pressure on the firms to explain why bills and UK profits have been going up, as they appear before a influential House of Commons committee of MPs. Read the full story here. Other promising sessions today: 9.30am - Business, Innovation and Skills Committee takes evidence on the UK retail sector from witnesses including veteran retailer Bill Grimsey and business minister Michael Fallon. 10am - Treasury Committee takes evidence from former executives of the Co-operative Banking Group on the collapse of the deal to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches, know as Project Verde. Banks are not popular this morning. The FTSE 100 has opened slightly higher, up 0.2% at 6,740, but UK banks are trading lower. Lloyds Banking Group: -3.3% at 77 Royal Bank of Scotland: -2% at 360.2 Standard Chartered: -1.8% at 1,506 Barclays: -1.1% at 260.4 Lloyds has this morning revealed a further \u00a3750m hit for payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the mis-selling scandal to more than \u00a38bn. The hit contributed to a \u00a3440m loss in the third quarter. It was the first update from the bailed out bank since the government started sellling off part of its stake last month.

The Blockbuster announcement came as MPs discussed on Tuesday whether changes to business rates were needed to help retailers. Bill Grimsey, a retail campaigner and former Iceland boss, told the Commons business innovation and skills committee that the government should urgently review the way rates were calculated and scrap a decision to delay a revaluation of rates by two years to 2017. He said: \"The only beneficiaries from this delay are big retailers while small ones in the north of England are suffering.\" Research issued by his team suggested Britain's four biggest supermarkets would save \u00a31.3bn as a result of the delay but independent retailers' rents would remain artificially high. Speaking after the committee hearing, Paul Turner Mitchell, a member of Grimsey's team, accused the government of delaying the change to business rates until after the 2015 election for political reasons because it would result in higher rates in Conservative heartlands in the south of England. But Brandon Lewis, the minister responsible for high streets, batted away suggestions from members of the committee that the government should bring forward a revaluation of rates or undertake research into how the tax could be made more fair. He said the government had delayed plans for a 2015 revaluation of rates until 2017 to protect businesses from \"volatility\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is cutting almost 500 jobs in Scunthorpe, Cumbria and Teeside, blaming a slump in demand across the European construction industry and the cost of green levies. Announcing the cuts, the company and its biggest union called on the government to do more to support the steel sector by helping with exports and encouraging use of UK steel in building projects. About 340 jobs will go in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, where Tata employs 4,000 workers. Almost a third of the 300 workers at Workington in Cumbria will lose their jobs and 40 jobs will go at Teesside, where Indian-owned Tata, which owns what was once British Steel, employs 1,500 people. The cuts come less than a year after 900 steel job losses, mainly in Port Talbot, Wales. Tata said then that the cuts were part of a plan to cope with terrible market conditions. Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, Tata Steel's European chief executive, said: \"European steel demand this year is expected to be only two-thirds of pre-crisis levels after falls in the last two years. On top of the challenging economic conditions, rules covering energy and the environment in Europe and the UK threaten to impose huge additional costs.\" The financial crisis exacerbated overproduction in the European steel industry. China's rapidly expanding capacity has also pushed up the price of iron ore, the sector's main raw material, while putting downward pressure on the price of steel. Eurofer, which represents the steel industry, forecasts that steel consumption will fall 4.5% this year in Europe with only 0.5% growth expected in 2014. Europe has emerged from its long recession but growth is still sluggish and manufacturing is picking up in the UK, albeit from a low base. Tata said steel is one of the last industries to benefit from economic recovery because customers can use stockpiles left over from the boom years before buying more. Tata and the Community trade union, which represents most iron and steel workers, called on the government to do more to support the industry. Michael Leahy, Community's general secretary, said: \"The business has been dealing with a downturn in some of its markets for the past five years. Nevertheless, today's news once again reflects the fragile state of our economy and the lack of any real impetus by government to support our manufacturing base.\" The union called on the government to come up with a proper strategy to support UK industry, including giving companies incentives to use UK steel instead of cheap imports for big infrastructure and building projects. However, the Unite union accused Tata of trying to \"sack its way out of a downturn\". Its national officer Paul Reuter said: \"We are urging the leadership of Tata Steel in the UK to look at what steps are needed to grow the company rather than slashing jobs.\"",

    "webTitle": "Co-op Bank's former chief accused over \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former boss of the Co-operative Bank has been accused by a committee of MPs of running the business with such a tight capital position that a \"puff of wind\" could have blown it over. In an appearance at the Treasury select committee , Barry Tootell was repeatedly asked about the bank's assertions that it was in a strong position at the end of 2012, at a time when regulators were discussing its need for additional capital in the future. He insisted the capital buffer was adequate under the rules in place at the time. The Co-operative Group is ceding control of the bank amid pressure from hedge funds as the supermarket, grocery and funeral homes business races to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. Tootell, who insisted that the bank's capital position had been strong, was also accused of being affected by \"corporate amnesia\" at the Co-op Bank and \"sliding away\" from answers. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, told Tootell that the bank's capital position was such that a \"puff of wind could blow you over\", and accused him of \"sailing close to the wind\" with his assertion that the bank had a strong capital position at the end of 2012. Tootell denied this. The MPs were taking evidence from Tootell, who quit after the bank was downgraded to junk in May, as part of their investigation into the failure of the mutually-owned bank to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group in a deal codenamed Project Verde. He Tootell quit after Moody's downgraded the bank more severely than he had expected, although he told MPs he had indicated his intention to go five months earlier. As finance director at the time when Co-op Bank merged with the Britannia Building Society, which is being blamed in part for the losses at the Co-op, Tootell told MPs he took responsibility for the analysis of the former building society's accounts and refused to blame an analysis by accounting firm KPMG. He said the regulators had scrutinised Britannia three months before the deal with the Co-op and concluded the building society needed up to \u00a340m more in capital. The Co-op had conducted its own analysis and concluded there was a further \u00a3700m of potential \"fair value\" losses by Britannia. \"This was never, ever discussed as a rescue,\" Tootell said when asked if the Co-op had been helping Britannia. He was appointed temporary chief executive in June 2011 after the resignation of Neville Richardson, the former Britannia boss who had been promoted to run the enlarged organisation. Tootell said the Co-op had pulled out of the takeover of the Lloyds branches in April on his recommendation, but he acknowledged that there not been \"unanimous approval at all times\" by Co-op group executives. Tootell set out two reasons for the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall \u2013 the bill for compensating customers for payment protection insurance (PPI) and the losses in its non-core lending, largely stemming from the Britannia acquisition in 2009. The scale of the capital shortfall did not emerge until June, after the Bank of England revealed that Co-op needed to find \u00a31.5bn of extra capital after it had conducted an industry-wide analysis. Tootell said the Co-op had established that its capital position was becoming tighter in November 2012 while it was still in discussions about buying the Lloyds branches. But he felt the bank had a plan \u2013 codenamed Pennine \u2013 to rectify the position by selling its insurance business and cutting back on leverage. Evidence from the former Co-op bank chairman, the Rev Paul Flowers, has been delayed until next week.",

      "body": "<p>The former boss of the Co-operative Bank has been accused by a committee of MPs of running the business with such a tight capital position that a \"puff of wind\" could have blown it over.</p> <p>In an appearance at the Treasury select committee , Barry Tootell was repeatedly asked about the bank's assertions that it was in a strong position at the end of 2012, at a time when regulators were discussing its need for additional capital in the future. He insisted the capital buffer was adequate under the rules in place at the time.</p> <p>The Co-operative Group is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/27/co-operative-group-retail\" title=\"\">ceding control of the bank amid pressure from hedge funds</a> as the supermarket, grocery and funeral homes business races to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall.</p> <p>Tootell, who insisted that the bank's capital position had been strong, was also accused of being affected by \"corporate amnesia\" at the Co-op Bank and \"sliding away\" from answers.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, told Tootell that the bank's capital position was such that a \"puff of wind could blow you over\", and accused him of \"sailing close to the wind\" with his assertion that the bank had a strong capital position at the end of 2012. Tootell denied this.</p> <p>The MPs were taking evidence from Tootell, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/10/cooperative-bank-chief-quits-moodys-downgrade\" title=\"\">who quit after the bank was downgraded to junk in May</a>, as part of their investigation into the failure of the mutually-owned bank to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group in a deal codenamed Project Verde.</p> <p>He Tootell quit after Moody's downgraded the bank more severely than he had expected, although he told MPs he had indicated his intention to go five months earlier.</p> <p>As finance director at the time when Co-op Bank merged with the Britannia Building Society, which is being blamed in part for the losses at the Co-op, Tootell told MPs he took responsibility for the analysis of the former building society's accounts and refused to blame an analysis by accounting firm KPMG. He said the regulators had scrutinised Britannia three months before the deal with the Co-op and concluded the building society needed up to \u00a340m more in capital. The Co-op had conducted its own analysis and concluded there was a further \u00a3700m of potential \"fair value\" losses by Britannia.</p> <p>\"This was never, ever discussed as a rescue,\" Tootell said when asked if the Co-op had been helping Britannia. He was appointed temporary chief executive in June 2011 after the resignation of Neville Richardson, the former Britannia boss who had been promoted to run the enlarged organisation.</p> <p>Tootell said the Co-op had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/coop-pulls-out-talks-buy-lloyds-bank-branches\" title=\"\">pulled out of the takeover of the Lloyds branches in April</a> on his recommendation, but he acknowledged that there not been \"unanimous approval at all times\" by Co-op group executives.</p> <p>Tootell set out two reasons for the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall \u2013 the bill for compensating customers for payment protection insurance (PPI) and the losses in its non-core lending, largely stemming from the Britannia acquisition in 2009.</p> <p>The scale of the capital shortfall did not emerge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/17/co-operative-bank-stock-market-listing\" title=\"\">until June, after the Bank of England revealed that Co-op needed to find \u00a31.5bn of extra capital</a> after it had conducted an industry-wide analysis. Tootell said the Co-op had established that its capital position was becoming tighter in November 2012 while it was still in discussions about buying the Lloyds branches. But he felt the bank had a plan \u2013 codenamed Pennine \u2013 to rectify the position by selling its insurance business and cutting back on leverage.</p> <p>Evidence from the former Co-op bank chairman, the Rev Paul Flowers, has been delayed until next week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Abbott government is pressing ahead with preparations for a high-stakes decision about whether to increase taxpayer support to Australia's struggling carmakers, or stick with its pre-election commitment to reduce industry support by $500m. The government will on Wednesday outline terms of reference for a fast-tracked inquiry by the Productivity Commission to underpin a looming cabinet decision about what interventions the new Coalition government might or might not make in support of Australia's automotive manufacturers. The inquiry will examine the structure of the industry, its work practices and profitability, and its \"long-term sustainability.\" It will also consider \"the changing international automotive environment\" \u2013 including the potential for increasing exports and the \"type and level of support provided to overseas manufacturers\". It will also look at the \"nature of domestic demand and consumer preferences, including demand for new products and technologies\" and Australia's \"attractiveness as an investment location for all phases of automotive manufacturing activity\". The government is requiring interim recommendations by December 20 and a final assessment in March 2014 \u2013 ahead of the budget session in the new parliament. Holden has been warning for some time that without more government assistance it will quit its Australian manufacturing operations. But in unveiling the terms of reference, the government said it intended to respond to the current challenges in a \"measured way\". The government also pointed to \"significant measures\" it was already pursuing in support of the industry, including a decision not to proceed with a proposed tightening of the fringe benefits tax rules for company cars proposed by the ALP and the repeal of the carbon price. The Productivity Commission, an independent advisory body in the treasury portfolio, traditionally takes a \"dry\" line on subjects like industry support \u2013 pointing out the substantial ongoing costs to the taxpayer of subsidies and other business welfare. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, has also argued publicly that governments should not be in the business of propping up failing industries. Hockey has argued the car industry must be sustainable, and that includes pursuing a significant increase in exports. But the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, who is en route to Japan and China for a portfolio visit which, among other things, is expected to include a visit to Toyota, has made little secret of his support for the Australian car makers. Macfarlane has warned publicly that the industry is on the brink and has tried to draw a public line over the policy advocated by Sophie Mirabella, his predecessor in the industry portfolio, which was a reduction in support of $500m. He has suggested that one option to shore up the carmakers in the short term was to take funds from within the existing Automotive Transformation Scheme.

In early October Macfarlane warned that the repercussions of car factory closures would be felt throughout eastern Australia. \"I'm trying not to let [the car industry] down. I'm doing everything I can. But in the end it will be a decision of the government,\" the industry minister said after a visit to Ford in Victoria.",

Photograph: /Fifth &amp; Pacific</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Looking back at your career, it\u2019s interesting that you went from a company like Johnson &amp; Johnson to a fashion retailer such as Kate Spade. Did you have to adjust your leadership style at all when switching between the two industries?</strong></p> <p>In my case, my leadership style is what brought me here. I was a proven leader and know how to get results, and I'm marketing- and brand-driven. I have a certain brand of leadership that we call service leadership. I believe that leaders need to be present and useful to their people.</p> <p>I had developed a certain leadership style, and I think that I was hired for it. There are lots of things you have to do when you change industries.</p> <p>I had been in a number of different industries \u2013 consumer product, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and, in this case, fashion and retailing. Because we're now a true retailer, that in itself has an industrial profile different from that of a wholesaler of fashion goods. You have to have a certain basic set of values to change industries, including the ability to learn, the ability to listen and the ability to adapt to very different business models, and not necessarily cling to one set of truths about how companies work, even leadership models.</p> <p>But leadership style, I would say is something that gets built upon, experience by experience. One thing I will say is there are remarkable similarities between companies in industries as they relate to hiring, leading, developing and motivating people. More than not, the common denominators are actually profound.</p> <p><strong>How do you keep your staff motivated?</strong></p> <p>You know, keeping my team, my staff motivated and inspired comes from keeping them very in touch with a big vision and big goals. The more viscerally people feel about that vision and their near-term and long-term goals, the more inspired and self-motivated and productive they become.</p> <p>I think there's sort of two planes that you always have to work on. Everybody has, what I call, their little fire box \u2013 the thing they're working on, putting out a fire or managing a deadline, the short-term stuff. But it's also very important that \u2013 the forest for the trees analogy \u2013 they constantly re-energize [the team with] big audacious goals that involve disrupting the marketplace, taking market shares, winning over new consumers, growing. I think it's the leader's job to make sure people are connecting to that.</p> <p><strong>What did disrupting the marketplace mean for Kate Spade? Does it mean putting yourself as the company out there and experimenting with the product?</strong></p> <p>Disruption, maybe in the context that you mention it, might be an overused word, because by and large most companies have reached a certain place, and more often than not they're working to further entrench that position. So disruption may be overused and certainly it isn't in our company.</p> <p>We're a company that completely reinvented and remade itself. We've swung from being a very mature and declining US wholesaler of mid-price women's fashion to being a global company with lifestyle brands across-categories, with our own direct-to-consumer channels.</p> <p>The word disruption definitely applies \u2013 and I will use the case of Kate Spade, which in 2007 had a brand far bigger than its business. It was a very well known and well regarded brand that had lost cultural relevance and was managed as a very small business.</p> <p>We took a step back and said we were going to allocate capital for growth directly against the consumer. We were going to take control of our brand and reimagine what Kate Spade was, with the provisional positioning that we were going to modernize it while still being classic. We were truly going to go for lifestyle branding. So what we meant by disruption is that we were literally going to disrupt the market structure and the market share. We saw brands like Coach as having an increasingly vulnerable image; they had gotten to a certain size and presence, almost ubiquitous.</p> <p>So for us, disruption really was about taking a good business, with a big awareness profile, and making the business underneath that profile significant. And we've done it. What we've done is we disrupted consumer perception and market share. We're in the very early stages of it still. This is a company with a long runway for growth but disruption is the name of the game. That meant building our own capabilities in what are called the omni-channel capabilities.</p> <p>One the paradigms that we disrupted is the traditional brick and mortar versus wholesale versus e-commerce component. Everybody is using the words \"omni-channel\" and that's a good thing. Retailers should be using it. But for us, we've reached what I'd call disruptive penetration level for Kate Spade in e-commerce. So that means disrupting behaviors, disrupting thought patterns, disrupting business models, disrupting market segments, disrupting market share, those are the contexts for disruption.</p> <p><strong>Just a few months back, you wrote&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/06/14/father-power-why-men-must-talk-with-their-kids-about-domestic-violence/\">an op-ed</a>&#xa0;about why men should talk about domestic violence with their children. Why do you think it's important for leaders to speak on certain issues such as this one?</strong></p> <p>Well, it's so interesting. First of all, it's a responsibility you have. I mean, I sit on top of this company with more than 12,000 people and I see an awful lot of humanity and a lot of issues. The issue of domestic violence is one that our company has taken a leadership position on for longer than a decade. And we have been actually one of the three most influential companies in the United States in actually creating language and mobilizing people.</p> <p>As a leader of a company that has people in far-flung regions of the world, as well as in tiny cities in American states, I have discovered painfully how the silent problems of domestic violence, beyond being a topic that we chose a long time before I got here, how it actually impacts the business environment.</p> <p>And I will tell you, in my first week here, there was a murder in one of our distribution centers \u2013 where one of our best workers was murdered by her husband. And it immediately brought home the issue, it brought to life the necessity of the workplace being a safe harbor environment for people that can stand up and ask for help. The striking thing about it is, that it's a pervasive problem that strikes every socio-economic class, every age group. There are women CEOs, believe it or not, out there that have a domestic violence problem in their own house.</p> <p>So for me that's the background. Add to that the fact that the world has now gotten to the place where media is very democratic, they are so many places we, as individuals, can step up. Whether it's blogging, whether it's social media, whether it's being very visible. There are so many services where we can stand up and use our voice and our position to lobby and advocate for a solution.</p> <p>So, yes, I think that it's an important part of my job, of any leader's job. I think it's what leadership is about and that particular issue is very important to me.</p> <p>I chose to write that op-ed as a challenge to fathers around the country to talk to their kids over Father's Day weekend. I have three sons, and it's something I've certainly included in my leadership lessons, if you want to call them that: it's what's important in being a great person and a great man.</p> <p><strong>Something that companies tend to struggle with during a transition is staying on message. How did you handle that as you are bringing in people and changing your business?</strong></p> <p>While it sounds like a really daunting task to hire people when you are in effect redressing, or reskinning, the company. I always refer to it as changing tires on the car at full speed. But while it sounds like a daunting task, it wasn't hard here, honestly.</p> <p>Almost without fail, I was able to hire the people that I had identified on the outside. The reason [they came] is that we were selling a very compelling vision. People got it. I would have had a much harder time asking them to come to the old company, which was, honestly,&#xa0;seen as a dying business model and an aged platform \u2013 what I call a sunset situation versus sunrise situation.</p> <p>When we describe how we were structured, our strategy, that we were putting all of our attention and emphasis on creating a brand franchise for consumers and lifestyle branding with global omni-channel \u2013 these are the things that some of the most talented people in the industry were flocking towards.</p> <p>Effectively we were in the headlines reporting negative earnings, going through a really brutal turn in terms of the balance sheet debt, and at times going through uncertainty in terms of working capital and lines of credit. There were rumors of bankruptcy back in 2009. Honestly, people looked around and they said \"You've got the right brand, you've got the right idea, some great people work there. I'm going to take the leap.\" And we got plenty.</p> <p>It separates the strong from the weak. People who need more a comfortable situation, they were not attracted. And I was not attracted to them. I was looking for pioneers, self-starters. I was looking for people who could look me in the eye and say \"Sign me up\" or \"I want to go to battle with you.\"</p> <p>I think it's important, I think it's an interesting fact, it's one that I am proud of \u2013 I didn't even bring with me my administrative assistant from J&amp;J. I didn't bring one person that I had worked with. Not one. It wasn't appropriate here. I really needed the best possible people from this industry. And so in my case, every single person I hired was an experiment. I was taking a risk I had no prior leadership experience with them. But I needed their experience in business. Without fail, that worked.</p> <p>And we did make mistakes. There were times I hired somebody that would have been right in a slightly different situation. And when that happened, usually we mutually reached the same conclusion and they moved on and I would rehire. You'll never have a batting average of a thousand with hiring.</p> <p><strong>Everyone talks about networking as playing a significant role in finding the right job, or even in growing one\u2019s company. What is your take on networking? Have you found it to be useful?</strong></p> <p>I think it's an essential element of humanity and the human condition. We network in our personal lives without even knowing we're networking. It's how humans connect. And so the answer is, networking is incredibly important personally and professionally. It works both ways.</p> <p>As what I will call an \"acquirer of talent\", it's as important for me to have a network and be out networking as it is for people looking to be acquired. In other words, I need to be networking as much as people out in the job market looking to get hired.</p> <p>I have this philosophy: \"Drill a well before you need a drink.\" It relates to a lot of things, but particularly talent and recruiting. And so one of the first things when I got in the industry was I got out there, breakfasts, lunches and dinners, sometimes five days a week, three meals a day meeting some of the famous people in the industry, with competitors who would never come work at my company, or whom I would never be looking to hire. I met with them to to learn, to hear about their experiences, almost to know their brand, if you will, in the labor market of our industry. Invariably it led to friendships, which in turn led to references, which in turn led to connections and the people that I wanted to hire.</p> <p>Today, informally, LinkedIn is an incredible network It's way for people to opt into a network and build friendships and familiarity. We use LinkedIn in a significant way and I use my own page to look at and get to know talent.</p> <p>Networking is incredibly important at the peer level as well. I was very eager to meet, not only the other CEOs and founders that we compete against, but leaders of businesses that we don't compete against. These people have been able to mentor me in an informal way, and I picked up a lot of what I'd call \"dirt under the fingernails\" from some of these people, and over time it's been helpful. People that I in the end was able to call and say who is your distributor in Australia? \u2013 as an example. They make introductions. I would say networking is incredibly important.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of seeking out advice, what is the best business advice that you have ever gotten?</strong></p> <p>Jack Welch, at a dinner I had with him seven years ago, looked me in the eye and said, \"As a CEO everyone would tell you to be careful and slow down and be cautious. But my regrets are always the decisions that I delayed or the situations that I allowed to simmer and to see if they resolved.\" In other words, he said my greatest regrets are the things I didn't do fast enough, not the things I did too fast. And it's the greatest advice I've had. Because, by the way, I will say seven years as the CEO here, I have the same experience. Even to this day, my greatest regrets are not that I moved to fast on anything, but that there are some things I wish I moved faster on.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's hard to imagine Kate Spade as a dying company, but that's what it was in 2006 when it was acquired by Liz Caliborne, Inc for $124m. Within that same week, Liz Claiborne added someone else who was new: former Johnson &amp; Johnson chairman William L McComb, whose job was to take two dowagers of fashion \u2013 Kate Spade and Liz Claiborne \u2013 and make them chic again. In the seven years since McComb took charge of Liz Claiborne, the company has had more than a little surface nip and tuck. Not only did its name change to Fifth &amp; Pacific, but McComb has been hard at work whittling down its portfolio with the focus on building out its flagship brand \u2013 Kate Spade. Most recently, the company sold off its Juicy Couture brand for $195m. According to McComb, the decision to sell Juicy Couture, leaving Fifth &amp; Pacific with just two brands, Lucky and Kate Spade, \u201cis all about bringing Kate Spade to its full potential\u201d. The Guardian sat down with McComb to talk about leadership activism and guiding a company such as Fifth &amp; Pacific through the transition of rebranding. Looking back at your career, it\u2019s interesting that you went from a company like Johnson &amp; Johnson to a fashion retailer such as Kate Spade. Did you have to adjust your leadership style at all when switching between the two industries? In my case, my leadership style is what brought me here. I was a proven leader and know how to get results, and I'm marketing- and brand-driven. I have a certain brand of leadership that we call service leadership. I believe that leaders need to be present and useful to their people. I had developed a certain leadership style, and I think that I was hired for it. There are lots of things you have to do when you change industries. I had been in a number of different industries \u2013 consumer product, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and, in this case, fashion and retailing. Because we're now a true retailer, that in itself has an industrial profile different from that of a wholesaler of fashion goods. You have to have a certain basic set of values to change industries, including the ability to learn, the ability to listen and the ability to adapt to very different business models, and not necessarily cling to one set of truths about how companies work, even leadership models. But leadership style, I would say is something that gets built upon, experience by experience. One thing I will say is there are remarkable similarities between companies in industries as they relate to hiring, leading, developing and motivating people. More than not, the common denominators are actually profound. How do you keep your staff motivated? You know, keeping my team, my staff motivated and inspired comes from keeping them very in touch with a big vision and big goals. The more viscerally people feel about that vision and their near-term and long-term goals, the more inspired and self-motivated and productive they become. I think there's sort of two planes that you always have to work on. Everybody has, what I call, their little fire box \u2013 the thing they're working on, putting out a fire or managing a deadline, the short-term stuff. But it's also very important that \u2013 the forest for the trees analogy \u2013 they constantly re-energize [the team with] big audacious goals that involve disrupting the marketplace, taking market shares, winning over new consumers, growing. I think it's the leader's job to make sure people are connecting to that. What did disrupting the marketplace mean for Kate Spade? Does it mean putting yourself as the company out there and experimenting with the product? Disruption, maybe in the context that you mention it, might be an overused word, because by and large most companies have reached a certain place, and more often than not they're working to further entrench that position. So disruption may be overused and certainly it isn't in our company. We're a company that completely reinvented and remade itself. We've swung from being a very mature and declining US wholesaler of mid-price women's fashion to being a global company with lifestyle brands across-categories, with our own direct-to-consumer channels. The word disruption definitely applies \u2013 and I will use the case of Kate Spade, which in 2007 had a brand far bigger than its business. It was a very well known and well regarded brand that had lost cultural relevance and was managed as a very small business. We took a step back and said we were going to allocate capital for growth directly against the consumer. We were going to take control of our brand and reimagine what Kate Spade was, with the provisional positioning that we were going to modernize it while still being classic. We were truly going to go for lifestyle branding. So what we meant by disruption is that we were literally going to disrupt the market structure and the market share. We saw brands like Coach as having an increasingly vulnerable image; they had gotten to a certain size and presence, almost ubiquitous. So for us, disruption really was about taking a good business, with a big awareness profile, and making the business underneath that profile significant. And we've done it. What we've done is we disrupted consumer perception and market share. We're in the very early stages of it still. This is a company with a long runway for growth but disruption is the name of the game. That meant building our own capabilities in what are called the omni-channel capabilities. One the paradigms that we disrupted is the traditional brick and mortar versus wholesale versus e-commerce component. Everybody is using the words \"omni-channel\" and that's a good thing. Retailers should be using it. But for us, we've reached what I'd call disruptive penetration level for Kate Spade in e-commerce. So that means disrupting behaviors, disrupting thought patterns, disrupting business models, disrupting market segments, disrupting market share, those are the contexts for disruption. Just a few months back, you wrote an op-ed about why men should talk about domestic violence with their children. Why do you think it's important for leaders to speak on certain issues such as this one? Well, it's so interesting. First of all, it's a responsibility you have. I mean, I sit on top of this company with more than 12,000 people and I see an awful lot of humanity and a lot of issues. The issue of domestic violence is one that our company has taken a leadership position on for longer than a decade. And we have been actually one of the three most influential companies in the United States in actually creating language and mobilizing people. As a leader of a company that has people in far-flung regions of the world, as well as in tiny cities in American states, I have discovered painfully how the silent problems of domestic violence, beyond being a topic that we chose a long time before I got here, how it actually impacts the business environment. And I will tell you, in my first week here, there was a murder in one of our distribution centers \u2013 where one of our best workers was murdered by her husband. And it immediately brought home the issue, it brought to life the necessity of the workplace being a safe harbor environment for people that can stand up and ask for help. The striking thing about it is, that it's a pervasive problem that strikes every socio-economic class, every age group. There are women CEOs, believe it or not, out there that have a domestic violence problem in their own house. So for me that's the background. Add to that the fact that the world has now gotten to the place where media is very democratic, they are so many places we, as individuals, can step up. Whether it's blogging, whether it's social media, whether it's being very visible. There are so many services where we can stand up and use our voice and our position to lobby and advocate for a solution. So, yes, I think that it's an important part of my job, of any leader's job. I think it's what leadership is about and that particular issue is very important to me. I chose to write that op-ed as a challenge to fathers around the country to talk to their kids over Father's Day weekend. I have three sons, and it's something I've certainly included in my leadership lessons, if you want to call them that: it's what's important in being a great person and a great man. Something that companies tend to struggle with during a transition is staying on message. How did you handle that as you are bringing in people and changing your business? While it sounds like a really daunting task to hire people when you are in effect redressing, or reskinning, the company. I always refer to it as changing tires on the car at full speed. But while it sounds like a daunting task, it wasn't hard here, honestly. Almost without fail, I was able to hire the people that I had identified on the outside. The reason [they came] is that we were selling a very compelling vision. People got it. I would have had a much harder time asking them to come to the old company, which was, honestly, seen as a dying business model and an aged platform \u2013 what I call a sunset situation versus sunrise situation. When we describe how we were structured, our strategy, that we were putting all of our attention and emphasis on creating a brand franchise for consumers and lifestyle branding with global omni-channel \u2013 these are the things that some of the most talented people in the industry were flocking towards. Effectively we were in the headlines reporting negative earnings, going through a really brutal turn in terms of the balance sheet debt, and at times going through uncertainty in terms of working capital and lines of credit. There were rumors of bankruptcy back in 2009. Honestly, people looked around and they said \"You've got the right brand, you've got the right idea, some great people work there. I'm going to take the leap.\" And we got plenty. It separates the strong from the weak. People who need more a comfortable situation, they were not attracted. And I was not attracted to them. I was looking for pioneers, self-starters. I was looking for people who could look me in the eye and say \"Sign me up\" or \"I want to go to battle with you.\" I think it's important, I think it's an interesting fact, it's one that I am proud of \u2013 I didn't even bring with me my administrative assistant from J&amp;J.

      "bodyText": "Mortgages approved by British lenders jumped to their highest level for more than five years in September, fanning fears the housing market was already heating up even before the latest government support kicked in. Banks, building societies and other lenders approved 66,735 mortgages in September, the biggest monthly total since February 2008, before the global financial crisis took hold. The figures, from the Bank of England, were just ahead of City forecasts of 66,000 and compared with an upwardly revised 63,396 in August. Mortgage approvals are seen by economists as a good early indicator of where the housing market is headed. They follow government data on Monday showing house prices rose in every English region in September and are likely to be seized on by those who argue that the government's Help to Buy scheme risks creating a new bubble. \"All the stimulus thrown at the housing market risks starting another dangerous boom-bust cycle,\" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank. \"The key issue is not where prices are today, rather it is where they will be in a couple of years. Prices and activity are rising fast now. We expect house prices to rise 10% year on year next year \u2026 The measures that selectively boost the housing market, like the Help to Buy scheme, should be scrapped.\" The plan to kickstart the property market and help homebuyers struggling to get on the property ladder gives a taxpayer-backed guarantee to lenders offering 95% mortgages that are open to first-time buyers and home movers on newbuild homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. Despite criticism from the International Monetary Fund and many economists, the scheme was expanded this month. In an attempt to quell criticism of his scheme, the chancellor, George Osborne, recently asked the Bank of England to monitor its impact and report back in a year. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest numbers underlined the need for policymakers to be ready to act \"quickly and decisively if signs of the housing market overheating become increasingly widespread and pronounced\". Archer said it appeared a number of factors were supporting the property market even before the latest phase of Help to Buy was launched: improved consumer confidence, higher employment and extended low mortgage interest rates, the first stage of Help to Buy and the Funding for Lending scheme \u2013 a Bank of England initiative to increase the flow of cheap finance to credit-starved businesses. \"We are currently a long way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging. Nevertheless, there is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme,\" Archer added. Others argued the housing market was still well below its peak and there were few warning signs of a bubble forming. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, emphasised that mortgage lending, at \u00a31bn, was only \"a touch\" above the average of \u00a30.7bn over the previous two years. Mortgage approvals were still close to 40% down on their typical pre-recession levels, he added. \"Given that interest rates on Help to Buy mortgage products look expensive and lending criteria are strict, we doubt the scheme will boost mortgage demand much. Note too that banks appear to have little appetite to substantially increase the size of their mortgage books,\" Tombs said. \"For now, then, there remains little evidence that a renewed boom in the housing market is developing.\" The Bank data contained some evidence that businesses found it easier to get finance in September. After dropping sharply in August, lending to non-financial businesses rose by \u00a3720m, the biggest increase since January. \"While it is important not to read too much into one month's figures, the size of the September increase in business lending reported by the Bank of England provides a significant boost to hopes that banks are now becoming more prepared to lend to businesses, given the improved economic situation and outlook,\" said Archer. The Bank's data showed, however, that within the overall rise, lending to small businesses fell in September. The British Chambers of Commerce said small businesses needed more help to get funds. \"It's good to see overall business lending rise, as this has an impact on business confidence. Yet these new figures show that while large firms have little difficulty tapping debt markets, SMEs \u2013 and particular young, fast-growing firms \u2013 continue to struggle to access growth capital,\" said Adam Marshall, its director of policy and external affairs. \"Both policymakers and financial institutions need to do more to help fast-growing SMEs access finance.\"",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group slumped to a loss in the third quarter after another \u00a3750m hit for payment protection insurance took the bailed-out bank's total bill for the mis-selling scandal to more than \u00a38bn. The industry's total bill for PPI is now close to \u00a320bn and Lloyds said the \u00a38bn included \u00a31.7bn of administrative costs. Chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio added that discussions were under way with the industry regulator to resume dividend payments for the first time since the financial crisis. He also increased his forecasts for the bank's margins and heralded the sale of part of the government's stake last month, which produced a \u00a360m profit. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said it was likely another tranche could be sold off in 2014 and that he supported the government's intention to include retail investors in the next sale. Last month, only City investors could participate in the share sale, when 15% of the tranche was sold off at 75p a share. \"The hard work of the last two and half years is coming to fruition,\" said the Lloyds boss. He stands to receive 3m shares \u2013 worth \u00a32.5m at current prices \u2013 if the share price can remain for 30 days in a row above the 73.6p level at which the taxpayer breaks even on its remaining 33% stake, or if a third of the stake is sold at prices over 61p. But despite his upbeat sentiment, the shares were among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, closing 2% lower at 78p. He promised that Lloyds would be a \"high-dividend\" paying stock in the future. The dividend policy will be outlined at the full-year results in February. \"We are back to being a normal company,\" he said. Although the bank remained profitable over nine months, in the third quarter it slumped to a \u00a3440m loss because of the \u00a3750m provision for PPI and a \u00a3600m shortfall arising from losses on sales of businesses in Germany. Over the nine months, pre-tax profit was \u00a31.7bn compared with a \u00a3607m loss in the same period last year. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said he supported the government Help to Buy scheme, which was leading to a significant jump in mortgage applications. He did not give details of the additional number of applications but said it was not just a London phenomenon. The bank is already providing one in four of home loans to first-time buyers, lending \u00a36.7bn to more than 56,000 people by the end of September. Recruited from the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander to turn Lloyds around, the Portuguese banker said the exit from non-core business had been completed. The bank has pulled out of 21 countries and it is now operating in just 10 as part of its effort to be a largely domestic bank. Troublesome operations in Ireland and commercial banking were also improving, with impairment charges on bad debts falling by 9% to \u00a31.2bn. The bank has spun out 631 branches under the TSB brand to meet EU demands y the EU that itto reduce its branch network as a result of the \u00a320bn of state aid it received during the 2008 and 2009 bank bailouts. This has cost around \u00a31.6bn and the TSB branches will be floated on the stock market, probably next year. Lloyds runs a multi-brand strategy \u2013 with Halifax and Bank of Scotland also competing with its main brand \u2013 and Horta-Os\u00f3rio said Halifax was benefiting from a new service which allows customers to switch bank accounts in seven days.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some of Britain's big six energy companies have seen their wholesale electricity costs fall over the last three years while still putting up prices for millions of households. The figures will put yet more pressure on the firms to explain why bills and UK profits have been going up, as they appear before a influential House of Commons committee of MPs. According to Ofgem, Npower paid an average of \u00a359.61 per megawatt-hour for electricity in 2010. The average wholesale price fell by 4% to \u00a357.32 in 2011 and rose by less than 2% to \u00a358.39 in 2012. The company increased retail prices by 5.1%, 7.2% and 9.1% respectively in those years. Similarly, EDF paid wholesale prices for electricity supplied to households of \u00a358.16MWh in 2010, falling by 0.6% to \u00a357.82 in 2011 and rising less than 5% to \u00a360.68 in 2012. In those years EDF's electricity prices to customers went up by 7.5%, 4.5% and 10.8% respectively. Meanwhile E.ON paid \u00a357.64MWh for its electricity in 2010, rising by 7% to \u00a361.82 in 2011 and falling by 4% to \u00a359.44 in 2012. It raised its power prices twice by a cumulative 20% in 2011, before cutting them by 6% in 2012. Asked why wholesale prices appeared to be out of kilter with increases in bills, companies said network and environmental costs had been the biggest factor in higher electricity bills, which are now around \u00a3600 a year on average. However, figures from Ofgem indicate electricity network costs have only risen by \u00a310 in each of the last four years, while green costs are rising by a similar amount. Green and social levies make up \u00a3112, or less than 9%, of the average household energy bill. With four of the big six \u2013 British Gas, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 announcing big price rises in the last few weeks, the companies are under increasing pressure to justify the increases, after figures from the energy regulator suggested the profit margin made by the companies per household has more than doubled from \u00a345 to \u00a395 over the last year. Ofgem said wholesale energy costs have gone up by just \u00a310 in a year, while VAT, operating and other costs are up \u00a340. The energy companies dispute this analysis and point to higher wholesale costs this winter. Downing Street yesterday said energy companies should account for the latest round of price rises, which have averaged 9% this autumn. Energy bill increases are continuing to cause a headache for the coalition, as a new YouGov poll shows 68% of the public believes Labour's energy price feeze is workable. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, called on the companies to \"come clean about why they are imposing yet another round of inflation-busting price rises this winter, when they are already making huge profits\". \"Revelations about rising profits and the growing gap between wholesale costs and household energy bills highlight why answers are needed,\" she said. Which?, the consumer group, yesterday called on the chancellor to tackle rising bills. The group said it wants the companies broken up and an end to the \"blank cheque\" of allowing energy companies to charge customers whatever they like for a government scheme to cut energy usage for poorer households. Will Straw, associate director at of the IPPR thinktank, also questioned why the big six think \"profits of 5% to 6% are acceptable in a competitive market\". \"In 1998, as the market was liberalised, the regulator believed 1.5% was an adequate margin for energy suppliers. Profits in other sectors like supermarkets are as low as 2%.\" Asked about the wholesale power prices, a spokesman for nPower pointed to comments by Paul Massara, its chief executive, who said earlier this year: \"The main factor behind rising costs is government policy and regulation to fund this country's transition to a more efficient economy, with modern infrastructure and warm, insulated homes for all.\" An EDF spokesman said wholesale energy costs have \"not been the main driver of increases in prices\". He added: \"When we last raised our prices in December 2012 we made it clear that a major driver was the increases we were seeing in the charges for transmission and distribution of energy to our customers.\" He also said EDF made no profit from supplying residential homes in the last three years and said it was impossible to do a \"perfect match-back between the tariff increases and the year-on-year increase in costs\". A spokesman for E.ON acknowledged wholesale prices influenced its power prices but said \"energy bills are about much more than just wholesale costs\", with just over 2% accounting for profit. In the House of Lords last night, Lord Jenkin condemned the energy \"oligopoly\" and tabled an amendment calling for greater competition. Another amendment in favour of decarbonising all of Britain's electricity by 2030, tabled by Lord Oxburgh, a former chairman of Shell, narrowly failed to pass.",
