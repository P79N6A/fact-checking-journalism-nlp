      "bodyText": "A wealthy British investor has been dragged into a deadly dispute over a South African mine, after a community leader was killed amid allegations that excavating the site would damage the environment. Threatening comments by Mark Caruso, the chief executive of the firm at the heart of the dispute, have also served to heighten tensions, say locals. Graham Edwards, chief executive of the property group Telereal Trillium, owns a stake of at least 23% in the Australian mining firm Mineral Commodities (MRC), which wants to mine for titanium at Xolobeni in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape. The plan faces opposition from members of the local Amadiba community, who say it will cause environmental problems and disturb ancestral gravesites on the 14-mile-long stretch of coastal sand dunes. Tensions in the community have escalated since the shooting earlier this year of Sikhosiphi \u201cBazooka\u201d Rhadebe, who was chairman of the Amadiba crisis committee. There is no suggestion that the company had any involvement with violence against opponents of its project. But local people have expressed dismay over the aggressive rhetoric deployed by Caruso, chief executive of MRC. In an email to \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the project in 2015, Caruso quoted the biblical line used by Samuel L Jackson\u2019s character in the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction before he shoots some drug dealers. \u201cFrom time to time I have sought the Bible for understanding and perhaps I can direct you to Ezekiel 25:17,\u201d wrote Caruso. \u201cAnd I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.\u201d In a separate email, Caruso vowed to crush enemies of the project. \u201cI am enlivened by [the] opportunity to grind all resistance to my presence and the presence of MRC \u2026 into the animals [sic] of history as a failed campaign,\u201d he said. In March this year, Rhadebe was shot eight times in the head by men posing as policemen. Several other anti-mining activists have also been killed or injured. The Amadiba community member Sinegugu Zukulu said: \u201cMRC is determined to disrupt our way of life. This proposed mine has brought us conflict in the community since the process was started. \u201cA community that used to live in peace is now in conflict. Graham Edwards must do an honorable thing tell MRC to leave us alone.\u201d Edwards has taken to Facebook to take issue with objections to the mine, after activists staged a protest outside the London offices of Telereal Trillium. \u201cAs I understand it, the mining process here involves taking sand, filtering it with water and magnetism and then replacing the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to understand the ecological damage that this is purported to cause. I would have thought that the economic benefits to the local community would be welcomed, but obviously that is for the local community to decide. \u201cI am surprised that your group feel that they have better information as to who committed this horrible crime than the authorities, but if you really do have evidence as to the guilty party then please do share it \u2013 particularly with the police.\u201d He also shared details of a survey, conducted by an independent firm, into local attitudes to the project. But sources said that while he was still in favour of the project, he was alarmed by the rhetoric employed by Caruso and planned to make his displeasure known. Edwards declined to comment. MRC said a poll of 200 locals showed that 77% either supported the mine unconditionally or wanted it to build local infrastructure. The company declined to comment on Caruso\u2019s biblical quotation. \u201cHistory shows not only have we invested substantially in mining development in South Africa but we have also done so working within the law in discharging our obligations under our prospecting and mining permits,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe believe that it is possible for responsible mining development to co-exist with environmental, social, and cultural purviews and this is what results in sustainable economic development.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is being urged to impose caps on charges for unarranged overdrafts to stop financially vulnerable customers being ripped off by their banks. The Financial Conduct Authority should go further than the competition watchdog, which last week stopped short of issuing mandatory pricing restrictions on banks, according to Rachel Reeves, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee. The Competition and Markets Authority, which has been investigating the banking sector since July 2014, last week said banks should set a maximum charge for unauthorised overdrafts and publish the fee. The banks would be allowed to set their own maximum. The Leeds West MP said that some banks already set a maximum and questioned the effectiveness of this remedy. She cited as examples Barclays\u2019 monthly cap of \u00a335 and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u00a390. Writing to Tracey McDermott, interim chief executive of the FCA, Reeves said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s monthly maximum charge remedy has been portrayed as a cap on unarranged overdrafts, yet it is difficult to see it as such when banks are allowed to set the level of their own cap.\u201d \u201cIndeed, as you will be aware, some banks already limit what they charge customers ... It is therefore hard to see how what the CMA proposed will bring about any fundamental change,\u201d she added. \u201cThe CMA has recommended that the FCA should undertake work to assess the effectiveness of the maximum monthly charge remedy and consider whether further measures could be taken to enhance its effectiveness. However, I ask that the FCA take this opportunity to go further and cap the unarranged overdraft charges,\u201d she said. The FCA declined to comment. The competition watchdog, which must publish its final report by 12 August, said last week that its aim was to halve the \u00a31.2bn customers pay in unauthorised overdraft fees each year. It has been looking at ways to boost competition in the current account and small business banking sectors, through which the industry generated \u00a314bn of revenue in 2014. Despite the arrival of new entrants, the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays have a 77% market share of current accounts. The CMA wants to encourage customers to switch providers through the creation of price comparison websites \u2013 but it is regarded as particularly difficult for customers with overdrafts to shop around. Reeves said in her letter: \u201cSome banks continue to rip off their customers with exorbitant charges for what are often minor account problems ... These charges unfairly penalise account holders who are struggling to stay on top of their finances. It is unjust that banks should push them into further financial hardship just because they are keen to make a quick buck.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green, who offloaded BHS for \u00a31 leaving a \u00a3571m deficit in its pension fund, could work with MPs on drafting new laws to ensure pensioners are protected in future, the MP Frank Field has suggested. Field, a co-chair of the parliamentary inquiry into the controversial sale of the stricken retailer, which has left around 13,000 employees facing pension losses, said Green could advise on new legislation regarding occupational schemes. As MPs prepared to question advisers and directors of Green\u2019s businesses involved in the sale, Field said there needed to be a new framework to guard against schemes being left underfunded. \u201cThe question is: what is the duty of these companies to these wonderful, magnificent but beached whales of occupational pension schemes that promised the earth in the days when we had high returns on capital?\u201d Field said MPs wanted Green\u2019s help in shaping a \u201cmega pension bill\u201d. He said: \u201cI mean that quite seriously. He\u2019s an intelligent man. He can be a key player in telling us what is the best deal we can get for many of the thousands of occupational pension schemes remaining \u2013 many of which are in big trouble.\u201d His words appear to represent something of an olive branch after Field had earlier suggested Green should be stripped of his knighthood unless he contributed sufficiently towards plugging the BHS pension fund deficit. Green and his family took a total of \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans from BHS during the 15 years he owned the high street chain. The pensions regulator is investigating whether Green\u2019s Arcadia group avoided financial obligations to the pension schemes. A spokesman for Green declined to comment. BHS was sold in March 2015 to Retail Acquisitions and went into administration at the end of last month, putting 11,000 high street jobs at risk. On Monday the parliamentary inquiry, conducted jointly between Field\u2019s work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee, will hold the second of five sessions of evidence, questioning advisers from banks and law firms behind the deal and unpicking how its buyer was considered to be suitable. Field said the inquiry would be trying to understand what advice was provided by the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs and on what basis: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this strange business where we\u2019ve got Lord Grabiner [a non-executive board member of Goldman Sachs International and chairman of Green\u2019s Taveta Investments vehicle] saying we didn\u2019t charge for our advice. What does that mean? Does that mean that the quality of advice is better with a fee, or is this the Pontius Pilate way out of trouble?\u201d Directors involved in the sale, including the chief executive of Arcadia Group, Ian Grabiner, a second cousin of Lord Grabiner, will be questioned in a separate panel. Lord Grabiner, who had attempted to avoid attending the committee, wrote in a statement that Green and the board had come to the conclusion in early 2015 that BHS should be sold: \u201cThe deterioration in the BHS business was such that the only practical alternative was to place the company into administration.\u201d However, more than \u00a325m was then paid out from the department store to its new owner Retail Acquisitions in its 13-month tenure before BHS collapsed into administration. The inquiry will hear from BHS pension trustees later in the week, before grilling Retail Acquisitions directors early next month. The hearings will culminate with Green facing MPs on 15 June.",

On Monday the parliamentary inquiry, conducted jointly between Field\u2019s work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee, will hold the second of five sessions of evidence, questioning advisers from banks and law firms behind the deal and unpicking how its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-olivia-petroleum\">buyer was considered to be suitable</a>.</p> <p>Field said the inquiry would be trying to understand what advice was provided by the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs and on what basis: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this strange business where we\u2019ve got Lord Grabiner [a non-executive board member of Goldman Sachs International and chairman of Green\u2019s Taveta Investments vehicle] saying we didn\u2019t charge for our advice. What does that mean? Does that mean that the quality of advice is better with a fee, or is this the Pontius Pilate way out of trouble?\u201d </p> <p>Directors involved in the sale, including the chief executive of Arcadia Group, Ian Grabiner, a second cousin of Lord Grabiner, will be questioned in a separate panel. </p> <p>Lord Grabiner, who had attempted to avoid attending the committee, wrote in a statement that Green and the board had come to the conclusion in early 2015 that BHS should be sold: \u201cThe deterioration in the BHS business was such that the only practical alternative was to place the company into administration.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m was then paid out from the department store to its new owner Retail Acquisitions</a> in its 13-month tenure before BHS collapsed into administration. </p> <p>The inquiry will hear from BHS pension trustees later in the week, before grilling Retail Acquisitions directors early next month. The hearings will culminate with Green facing MPs on 15 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A series of terrorist attacks, geopolitical unrest and an unabating migration crisis have dealt a severe blow to the tourist economies of north Africa and the near east, figures suggest. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released on Friday show that the numbers of British nationals travelling to past holiday hot spots such as Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey are in sharp decline. That picture is backed up by figures from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), which show those countries\u2019 tourism economies collapsing amid a sense that they have become no-go areas for foreign tourists. The as yet unexplained crash of a Cairo-bound EgyptAir passenger jet on Thursday with 66 people on board, months after the downing of a Russian jet in Sinai was claimed by Islamic State, is likely to cement that impression. Amanda Diboll from Leicestershire has previously holidayed in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey. But she told the Guardian: \u201cObviously in all these areas there have been a number of major incidents that have made us feel that the risk has become too great for a return visit.\u201d Since Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution, subsequent counter-revolution and the emergence of its own incipient Islamic State franchise, travel by UK nationals to the country has plummeted by nearly 50%, the ONS figures show. Tourists spent 4% less in Egypt last year compared with the year before, according to the WTTC, which forecasts a further 4% fall in 2016. Curiously, the ONS figures show a 2% rise in British nationals travelling to the country in 2015, but that came from a historic low in 2014. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said a fall in bookings with Abta members to Egypt could partly be explained by continuing doubts over the safety of Sharm el-Sheikh airport, the departure point for the Russian airliner that crashed over Sinai last October, and the gateway to the country\u2019s most popular tourist area. A Department for Transport edict still bans travel there from UK airports, Tipton said. While Egypt has suffered, the most dramatic impact of terrorism on tourism has been in Tunisia. The country where the Arab spring began in 2010 had seemed to have gained the most from revolution, with a quick transition from dictatorship to liberal democracy. By 2014 the country\u2019s tourist economy was booming again, with 417,000 visits to the country by British nationals. Then Seiffeddine Rezgui walked on to a beach last June and gunned down 38 people, mostly tourists enjoying the blazing Mediterranean sun. The attack, coming three months after the massacre of 22 people \u2013 again mainly foreigners \u2013 in a Tunis museum, prompted the British Foreign Office and many of its equivalents across Europe to advise against all but essential travel to the country. That warning remains in place and is part of the reason for the collapse of Tunisia\u2019s tourism industry. Visits by British nationals fell by nearly 40% in 2015 and, according to the WTTC, overall foreign spending in Tunisia fell by 37%. The picture in Turkey, long a European package tour favourite, is more nuanced. On the eastern frontier of Europe, with a bitter civil war playing out over its border with Syria, visits by British nationals fell 21% between 2011 and 2013. But since then, numbers have been on the rise. Now, with an increasingly visible role in the refugee crisis, strident international criticism of the government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and a growing conflict with Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority, the jitters are setting in again. Tipton said bookings for Turkish holidays were down a third, while the WTTC predicts a fall in tourist revenue of 2% in 2016. Amid an overall rise in holiday bookings in the past year, these countries\u2019 losses have been western Europe\u2019s gain. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a marked shift [in package holiday bookings] towards the western Mediterranean,\u201d said Tipton. \u201cThat\u2019s been the case since December really, that\u2019s what the booking patterns have shown.\u201d Portugal has seen the greatest benefit, according to Abta data, with an increase of almost a third in the number of package holiday bookings to the country, while its neighbour Spain has seen rises of more than a quarter. With sunseekers swarming to the costas, Tipton advised booking early before resorts fill up. The ONS data, which gives a wider picture of holiday habits but is less up to date, also reflects changing tastes \u2013 with a few surprises. It shows big gains between 2011 and 2015 for, among others, Barbados, Mexico and Morocco, as well as old favourites such as Italy, Portugal and Spain. Andrew Russell from Wimbledon, London said he would be happy to take his partner and their teenage children to Turkey, \u201cas the tourist destinations are nowhere near the trouble zones and I believe the terrorist threat is low\u201d. While mindful of the security situation in north Africa, he saw the fears over some other destinations as an opportunity for a less crowded break. \u201cApparently Spain is booming as the safe summer option, but I believe it would be a good time to go to Greece [or the] Greek islands,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they are no-go areas due to the refugee crisis. It should also be easier to get decent accommodation with less competition for places.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a highly critical report last month, the British government came under fire for what the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said was a failure to tackle the problem of food poisoning, which results in 20,000 people being hospitalised and 500 deaths every year. The thinktank blamed the worsening situation on a substantial fall in the number of food standards and environmental inspections between 2004 and 2013. The lack of inspections resulted in a cut in prosecutions, the thinktank said, and allowed sloppy procedures in the food industry to go unchecked. Now scientists in South Korea have developed a laser that can spot the presence of bacteria on the surface of food. The device could be used as an early warning system for consumers in the home and in restaurants, takeaways and grocery shops. The researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) envisage that their laser could eventually be used in a dongle attached to a mobile phone so that when people are shopping, they will be able to scan a piece of meat to see if harmful bacteria are present. Prof Paul Park, the principle investigator on the project, said the unit could also be installed as part of a \u201csmart\u201d fridge that would notify users when their food was dangerous to eat, or on the production line in a factory when meat was being processed. The laser works by recognising the movement of bacteria across the surface of food. It is cheap and can, in theory at least, be retrofitted to equipment. Since the laser can read through packaging and works on cooked and uncooked food, its use could be relatively widespread. When the red laser beam hits the food, the reaction of the light to the surface \u2013 the scatter pattern \u2013 can be read. If bacteria are present, this affects the reaction of the light and produces a different scatter pattern as they move around. A camera that takes images at a rate of 30 times a second is used to spot the differences. This means the laser can recognise when harmful bacteria are present, and warn the user of the phone, fridge or any other device in which it is housed. \u201cYou can install this technique into your refrigerator because it can use very tiny laser diodes and image sensors which can be found in your smartphone, and those are the only two important parts that you have to consider putting in,\u201d said Park, who specialises in diagnosing disease using lasers. So far, the technology has been able to detect the presence of Bacillus cereus and E coli. Bacillus cereus is a bacteria which causes food poisoning resulting in diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Feed infected with Bacillus cereus caused the death of three babies in 2014. Last November, the Chipotle chain temporarily shut 43 of its locations in the United States after an E coli outbreak. The tests carried out by the Korean scientists started on chicken breasts, which were infected and then examined using the laser and camera apparatus. While the laser can detect the presence of both of the types of bacteria, it cannot distinguish between them in the early tests. Because the equipment involved is relatively simple, it leaves a wide scope for how it can be used, Park said. This could extend from an attachable dongle for a smartphone, which could be pointed at food by a shopper in a supermarket, to one on a production line that scans food as it goes past. \u201cWe can simply implement this technology into [the] smartphone. You only need the small laser diodes which means that when you go to the restaurant and you order the food and you are not sure this is safe, you can just tap. You can go to the grocery market and see the chickens and other food and you can [test] by yourself.\u201d Park and his colleagues now aim to commercialise the technology and have suggested that it could be part of a \u201csmart\u201d fridge within the next two years. A prototype device is currently being developed, which will then be put through trials. \u201cI hope that within two years, we will see the smart refrigerator with this feature,\u201d he said. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how the Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic problem is easy to identify. As a nation, we live beyond our means. Consumption exceeds production. Exports are lower than imports, resulting in a balance of payments deficit that has got bigger over time. None of this is new. George Osborne is not the first chancellor of the exchequer to arrive in office expressing concern about the unbalanced nature of UK growth. Nor, as things stand, will he be the last. Some chancellors find that their biggest headache is the trade deficit and decide that the answer is to suck spending power out of the economy. If the slowdown goes too far and recession ensues, the trade deficit problem becomes a budget deficit problem. Really unfortunate chancellors have to cope with both at once. Osborne is one of those. The latest data show that the current account deficit is running at a record 7% of national output, while despite the improvement since 2010 the budget deficit in the last financial year was 4% of GDP. That is a twin deficit problem with a vengeance. Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps provided the template for how to cope with a twin deficit problem: stimulate growth through low interest rates while simultaneously tightening fiscal policy to bring down the budget deficit and to keep inflation in check. Add in a devaluation of the currency to boost exports and there\u2019s your recipe for rebalancing the economy. Figures provided by the House of Commons library show just how tight fiscal policy was in the years immediately after the second world war. The cost of the conflict meant that Britain had a budget deficit of just over 6% of GDP in 1946-47, but within three years this had been turned into a surplus of 4.6% of GDP. This was austerity red in tooth and claw. Other chancellors have trodden the same path. In the aftermath of the 1967 devaluation, Roy Jenkins wanted to make sure that the cheaper pound would boost exports rather than domestic consumption. The subsequent squeeze turned a 4% of GDP budget deficit into a 2% of GDP surplus within two years. Ken Clarke did the same after Black Wednesday in September 1992. Again there was a determination not to fritter away the gains from devaluation, so fiscal policy was tightened aggressively in the mid-1990s. The budget deficit peaked at 7% of GDP in 1993-94, but was showing a small 0.5% surplus within five years. With growth biased towards exports, the current account deficit almost disappeared. By the time Gordon Brown became chancellor, the twin deficit problem had disappeared. But only temporarily. In the years running up to the financial crisis, the current account deficit grew steadily bigger and, after running a budget surplus for three consecutive years around the turn of the millennium, Brown borrowed to finance public investment. The budget deficit on the eve of the Great Recession was 2.6% of GDP, but within three years had ballooned to a peacetime record of just over 10% of GDP. For a while, the 25% depreciation of sterling that occurred between mid-2007 and early 2009 helped the current account. But then a combination of factors made the picture rapidly worse. The financial crisis ended a period when the UK had been enjoying big surpluses on investment income. Declining North Sea production meant the UK became a net importer of oil. The crisis in the eurozone affected exports to Britain\u2019s biggest market. And, by historical standards, Osborne\u2019s attempt at diverting resources away from consumption and into production was modest. As an austerity chancellor, he simply has not been in the same league as Clarke or Jenkins, let alone Dalton and Cripps. This is obvious from the House of Commons library figures. These show that on current plans it took six years for Osborne to reduce the budget deficit by six percentage points of GDP \u2013 something Jenkins achieved in just two and Clarke in four. Progress in Osborne\u2019s first two years at the Treasury stalled in year three, 2012-13, when the deficit rose as a share of GDP. Given the sluggishness of the economy in the first half of the last parliament, it is easy to see why the chancellor failed to stick to his original deficit reduction targets. Indeed, it would have been self-defeating had he tried to do so, since higher taxes or lower spending would have led to even slower growth and greater pressure on the public finances. By giving himself more time to hit his fiscal targets, Osborne got the growth he was looking for. But it was the wrong sort of growth, the sort of growth that Dalton, Cripps, Jenkins and Clarke had expressly been seeking to avoid. In a sense what happened is understandable. Export-led growth was a challenge in 2012, since the eurozone was in near meltdown and the pound was rising on the foreign exchanges as a result. UK exports became less competitive at a time when demand was weakening. One alternative to export-led growth would have been investment-led growth. This, though, would have required action by the government, either through higher spending on infrastructure or through a national investment bank. Osborne could have squeezed current government spending harder in order to free up extra resources to finance higher investment spending. This would have led to faster and more sustainable growth. It is what Dalton and Cripps did in the late 1940s. Instead, capital spending was cut aggressively in the early years of the last parliament, and incentives were provided for banks to lend money for mortgages. It didn\u2019t take long for the housing market to recover, with knock-on effects for consumer spending. But this was never going to be the basis for a strong or lasting recovery. Britain now has house price inflation running at 10 times the level of general inflation, rising household indebtedness as individuals run down their savings to finance consumption and a whopping trade deficit. In the past, these have traditionally been the classic signs of overheating. Yet, in other respects the economy is clearly not overheating. Earnings growth is running at around 2% a year; manufacturing output is 10% lower than it was before the Great Recession; and the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index is rising at an annual rate of 0.3%. Osborne has a balanced budget rule, under which the government will be obliged to run budget surpluses unless growth is particularly weak. Balanced budgets are not unprecedented \u2013 Conservative chancellors kept a tight grip on the public finances in the 1950s and 1960s, with the exception of the pre-election years of 1959 and 1964. But the real challenge, then as now, was to cure Britain\u2019s supply-side problems: under-investment; poor management; inadequate skills; weak productivity. What Britain needs is a balanced economy rule. If that were adhered to, the deficits would look after themselves.",

      "bodyText": "The rise of Nigel Farage, Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen is often blamed on the angry, reaction of blue-collar workers to decades of falling living standards. The financial crash of 2008 only served to make the situation worse. And so the west finds itself in the grip of powerful protest movements that seek to brush aside failing, sclerotic institutions like the US congress and EU parliament in favour of more locally democratic administrations (or possibly right-of-centre governments with autocratic leaders). Yet the protest goes beyond a hard core of people who believe immigration has driven down their wages, filled their local school with children who can\u2019t speak English and denied them social housing. As a new documentary on release now shows, the pressures of modern work go well beyond the factory floor. The Divide reminds us of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett\u2019s book The Spirit Level, which documents how those in better-off societies and better-off jobs are making themselves unhappy. Globalisation is to some extent at fault, though not necessarily in the way we previously thought. A recent study of US wages data found that despite China, Russia and the previously communist east European countries entering the global economy in the late 20th century, wages generally increased until the turn of the century and the first term of George W Bush\u2019s presidency. It was not until 2003 that most household incomes went into decline. So rather than the previous narrative of stagnant wages for three decades, it seems that the incomes of all but the lowest-skilled blue-collar workers followed a rising arc in the 1980s and 1990s before a sudden reversal soon after the year 2000. This more recent decline in incomes was matched by rising costs, in particular one cost that is deliberately not captured in official inflation figures: property. For most people, that is not an insignificant expense, and, as we know, house prices began to rise steeply from the late 1990s, pushing up monthly mortgage payments. From 2001 we saw a flurry of initiatives designed to deal with falling incomes and rising costs in a desperate attempt to maintain living standards. Labour\u2019s introduction of tax credits in 2003 was the main prop under household incomes, extending as it did to those earning up to \u00a360,000. But other ways to maintain incomes \u2013 for instance, flexible working \u2013 allowed parents to dovetail working hours to minimise childcare costs. Flexibility came in the form of self-employment, flexible rotas and, to a lesser extent, zero-hour contracts. Each of these has transformed the labour market. The numbers of those in self-employment, after decades hovering around the 3 million mark, began to increase in 2001. Now there are 4.6 million self-employed people and they account for 15% of the workforce. There is scant research into what the newly self-employed do. The Royal Society of Arts has reported that thousands are young digital entrepreneurs. Others have set themselves up as drivers delivering the ever-growing mountain of stuff bought online. To a greater or lesser extent, they are using the internet to start businesses and cut costs. Most recently we have seen this in the technology that allows an estimated 30,000 self-employed Uber drivers to ply London\u2019s roads. In the five years after the financial crash the majority of new jobs were part-time, temporary or self-employed. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that full-time employment edged into the lead. We also see the search for cost-efficiency through flexibility in the public sector. What is the junior doctors\u2019 dispute if not a row about efficiency being put above the interests of family life? For years, the health service has maintained a low basic wage for Monday-to-Friday daytime working and higher rates for other times of the day and week to persuade staff to work unsociable hours. That\u2019s not enough any more, apparently: despite being highly coercive, it still gives the employee too much power. It is already common to find radiographers and phlebotomists on zero-hours contracts and tied to a bank of staff who must cater for a range of hospitals, minor injury units and GP practices. They sign up to monthly rotas and can\u2019t plan for a holiday or persuade a high street lender their work is secure enough to gain a mortgage. If the 1990s was characterised by increasing debt to fund a decent living, flexible working is the cancer eating away at 21st century workers. The defenders of flexible working argue that people like it. They are supported by surveys that show most appreciate being offered it. But as employment expert John Philpott points out, those who say they like zero-hours contracts are generally students and older workers, who have another income to fall back on. Even full-time workers say the flexibility they like does not come from draconian rota systems, but from time off to look after a sick child, and the opportunity to take leave or make up the hours another time. Working weekends and nights is rarely a pleasure. Regulators like the Bank of England are oblivious to the problems that are being stored up. Almost everyone on its interest-rate-setting committee believes that GDP growth will bring back permanent full-time employment. They should realise that, in an era of corporate anxiety and low investment, the trend will remain in the opposite direction.",

What is the junior doctors\u2019 dispute if not a row about efficiency being put above the interests of family life?</p> <p>For years, the health service has maintained a low basic wage for Monday-to-Friday daytime working and higher rates for other times of the day and week to persuade staff to work unsociable hours. That\u2019s not enough any more, apparently: despite being highly coercive, it still gives the employee too much power.</p> <p>It is already common to find radiographers and phlebotomists on zero-hours contracts and tied to a bank of staff who must cater for a range of hospitals, minor injury units and GP practices. They sign up to monthly rotas and can\u2019t plan for a holiday or persuade a high street lender their work is secure enough to gain a mortgage.</p> <p>If the 1990s was characterised by increasing debt to fund a decent living, flexible working is the cancer eating away at 21st century workers.</p> <p>The defenders of flexible working argue that people like it. <a href=\"http://natcen.ac.uk/media/27899/fourth-work-life-balancestudy.pdf\" title=\"\">They are supported by surveys</a> that show most appreciate being offered it. But as employment expert John Philpott points out, those who say they like zero-hours contracts are generally students and older workers, who have another income to fall back on.</p> <p>Even full-time workers say the flexibility they like does not come from draconian rota systems, but from time off to look after a sick child, and the opportunity to take leave or make up the hours another time. Working weekends and nights is rarely a pleasure.</p> <p>Regulators like the Bank of England are oblivious to the problems that are being stored up. Almost everyone on its interest-rate-setting committee believes that GDP growth will bring back permanent full-time employment. They should realise that, in an era of corporate anxiety and low investment, the trend will remain in the opposite direction.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another week, another load of folk being hauled in front a parliamentary select committee to talk about BHS. In attendance will be Ian Grabiner (pronounced like Ribena), chief executive of Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group \u2013 a former BHS owner \u2013 and his second cousin Lord Grabiner (pronounced less pretentiously), a board member at Green\u2019s holding company, Taveta Investments. Meanwhile, advisers to Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Green, will also show up, with the latter group appealing to aficionados. Among the details about Retail Acquisitions the committee may be hoping to glean is exactly how long Dominic Chappell (pronounced \u201cShapp-elle\u201d; the 90% owner of Retail Acquisitions) was working with one Paul Sutton, a 59-year-old businessman who was, separately, found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002. Sutton was originally in negotiations with Green to buy BHS, and internal documents show that he ran that bid under the project name Swiss Rock. Witnesses to some of those negotiations have also placed Chappell in Swiss Rock meetings during 2014, although he insisted last year that the pair had cut ties in February 2014. Confusingly, Retail Acquisitions used to be called Swiss Rock and Chappell has insisted he has no idea how that coincidence came about. Easy? Not with Stelios involved Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is a man with a consistent business plan. He uses his \u201ceasy\u201d brand to launch all kinds of ventures \u2013 and then he falls out with the management. This is an exaggeration, perhaps, but after years of sniping at the easyJet board \u2013 as well as another aviation venture, FastJet \u2013 Stelios had a little spat with the directors of easyHotel earlier this year: he reckons they are trousering too much pay. We may find out whether the Greek tycoon has a point, when easyHotel announces interim results. The company has actually been on a half-decent run of late: last month it unveiled a trading statement that cheered its house broker, Investec, with increased forecasts and a prediction that the shares could reach 120p (they closed Friday at 98p). \u201cThe company identified the potential for 12,000 owned and 15,000 franchised easyHotel rooms and is currently reviewing a range of office conversions, greenfield developments and the conversion of existing hotels to help achieve this potential,\u201d Investec gushed, while puffing the shares. Sounds OK. But will more of the same this week cheer up Stelios? Green tries to unseat MPs Sir Philip Green may have done his old mate Mike Ashley a favour when it comes to select committees. The collapse of BHS \u2013 and the subsequent probes into what went on there \u2013 have diverted some of the attention away from the issue of whether the Sports Direct founder might bother gracing Westminster with his presence, having been summoned to answer questions on working conditions at his firm. Having previously refused to rock up, Ashley performed a U-turn last week, saying that he would attend the business, innovation and skills committee \u2013 but only if MPs visited his Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire the day before. Anyway, the committee will meet this week to decide on how to react to this unconventional invitation, when they will surely send someone to the parliamentary archives to explore precedent (did Rupert Murdoch answer questions on phone hacking only after meeting MPs at private investigator Glenn Mulcaire\u2019s pad?). Also, Ashley has attempted to sweeten his invitation by offering to fly the parliamentarians to Shirebrook in his helicopter, which, like a Sports Direct sales promotion, might not prove to be the offer it appears. The select committee has 11 MPs (plus staff). Ashley\u2019s AgustaWestland seats eight.",

      "bodyText": "Another Sunday, another vote in the Greek parliament, another self-imposed punishment beating as the parliament in Athens votes through fresh austerity measures. There will be higher VAT and an increase in taxes on all the pleasures of life: coffee, booze, fags, gambling, even pay TV. And just in case Greece might need to tighten its belt by another couple of notches to meet stringent budget targets, there will be additional measures that will kick in if there is any fiscal slippage over the next couple of years. George Harrison started his song Taxman with the words: \u201cLet me tell you how it will be/There\u2019s one for you, nineteen for me.\u201d The Greeks know exactly what he meant. Greece\u2019s predicament is simple. It has debt repayments to make this summer and it doesn\u2019t have the money to pay the bills. The European Union can solve this acute cashflow problem by unlocking the funds pledged to Greece under the terms of last summer\u2019s bailout agreement, but it will only do so if Athens demonstrates that it is serious about sorting out its budget. Austerity today will lead to generosity from EU finance ministers when they meet on Tuesday. That, at least, is the hope of Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, who is looking for a package in which he gets debt relief in return for austerity. Here\u2019s where things get interesting. The difference between this Sunday and all the other tension-packed Sundays that have studded the Greek crisis over the past six and a half years is that, this time, the battle is not between Greece and the \u201ctroika\u201d of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Instead, there is a face-off between Europe and the IMF. The Europeans badly want the fund to be part of Greece\u2019s bailout and to contribute money to it. But Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, says her support is conditional on two things: a credible deficit reduction plan and a decent slug of debt relief. Hardline EU governments, led by Germany, have resisted this idea, fearing the Greeks will interpret any writedown of its debts as a sign of weakness that Athens will exploit to avoid meeting its budgetary commitments. EU finance ministers have sought to bridge the gap with the IMF by saying debt relief will be provided \u201cif necessary\u201d at the end of the bailout in 2018. This has the advantage, as far as Berlin is concerned, of deferring a decision until after German elections next year. The IMF is not going to swallow this classic piece of Brussels fudge. It wants debt relief for Greece and it wants it now. If not, the fund will walk away. This has been made abundantly clear by Lagarde and her officials. There is no prospect of Europe agreeing to write off a chunk of Greece\u2019s debt, so as an alternative to a \u201chaircut\u201d, the fund has proposed exceptionally soft terms: nothing until 2040, a 40-year repayment period thereafter lasting until 2080, and a 1.5% cap on interest rates. The fund believes this sort of package is necessary because Greece is expected to do the impossible \u2013 run a budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP excluding debt interest payments for two decades. So how will this end? With a compromise, probably, but one in which Europe will have to give most. There are two reasons for thinking that. The first is that the fund holds the better hand. Angela Merkel, for example, made fund involvement a prerequisite for Germany to agree a third Greek bailout. The threat of the IMF walking away is both real and powerful. The second reason is that the fund\u2019s proposal makes more sense. A long grace period, coupled with a cap on interest rates and more realistic budget surplus target, will not solve Greece\u2019s problems by any means. But they would help. Confused by pensions? So\u2019s the Bank The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, indulged in a little false modesty last week when he announced: \u201cI consider myself moderately financially literate. Yet I confess to not being able to make the remotest sense of pensions.\u201d Coming from someone widely considered one of the biggest brains in central banking, it was a damning indictment of the pensions system. Haldane didn\u2019t pull his punches: \u201cConversations with countless experts and independent financial advisers have confirmed for me only one thing \u2013 that they have no clue either.\u201d He went on to make a crucial point: not only is the pensions system fiendishly complicated, the onus is increasingly on individuals to understand it. Haldane is right. Financial decisions once made by the state or companies must now be shouldered by employees. Changes ushered in by George Osborne have only intensified that trend. The chancellor talked about \u201cfreedom and choice\u201d when, in his 2014 budget, he removed key restrictions on access to pension pots, ending the requirement to buy an annuity. But with freedom come risk and responsibility. There have been warnings against using pension savings for spending sprees, yet billions of pounds have been withdrawn since the change came into force. It would appear some people took Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb at his word when he said people should be free to blow their pension pot on a Lamborghini. These newly available pots of money have also turned some retirees into targets for con artists. In principle there are many merits to individuals being able to make their own decisions. But they need clearer information, the UK generally needs better financial education and, most importantly, the pensions system itself must be made simpler and governments must stop tinkering with it. Constant permutations and endless acronyms are a huge problem. If the Bank of England\u2019s top brain doesn\u2019t get it, what hope for the rest of us? M&amp;S needs to finds a profitable pattern for its clothing Sell more clothing at full price. That\u2019s basically what Steve Rowe, the new boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, needs to do to halt its losing streak in fashion. It\u2019s a simple formula and shouldn\u2019t use up much of the two hours set aside to brief City analysts at his maiden full-year results on Wednesday. Clothing remains M&amp;S\u2019s problem child, and despite rave reviews from the fashion press, women continue to turn away unless 20% off is dangled in front of them. Rowe, who is simultaneously a new broom and an old hand after 26 years at the retailer, is reviewing a wardrobe full of labels that increasingly blur together: when does North Coast reach Blue Harbour or M&amp;S Collection become a Classic? He\u2019s already promised to sharpen prices and become more fashionable, but in a tough retail climate he needs, ultimately, to pick a side. Does he want to dress older or younger shoppers, the well-off or the cost-conscious? M&amp;S can no longer be all things to all people \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work any more.",
