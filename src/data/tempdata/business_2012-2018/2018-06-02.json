      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s new government has a loose collection of contradictory policies that, if implemented, will quickly unravel. That is the view of the senior economist who, until Friday, was on track to become Italy\u2019s finance minister in the government of experts commissioned by the country\u2019s president. Marcello Messori, the director of the School of European Political Economy at Luiss University in Rome, stepped aside after the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League \u2013 the winners in Italy\u2019s recent general election \u2013 succeeded at the second attempt in hammering out a coalition deal. As a quiet weekend beckoned, Messori was contemplating the list of ministers put forward by the coalition\u2019s pick for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte \u2013 a little-known law professor who belongs to neither of the main parties and is not a member of parliament. Conte was blocked earlier in the week by Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, from appointing a Eurosceptic economy minister \u2013 a decision that provoked the anti-immigration, far-right League and the anti-establishment M5S to walk away from the talks. With emotions raw, Conte agreed to look elsewhere for an economy minister, and alighted on Professor Giovanni Tria, whose main claim to prominence was as president of the Italian National School of Public Administration, the main training ground for senior civil servants. Messori fears that Tria and Conte will struggle to reconcile tax and spending policies that together could send the public deficit spiralling out of control. \u201cWe have a joke in Italy about having a friend who is a drunk and yet carries around a full bottle of wine. It\u2019s a joke because it is impossible,\u201d he says. \u201cThe current contractual arrangement between the two parties is not only incompatible with European Union rules, but with economic stability,\u201d he adds. \u201cSmashing together their policies when they were not only very different but contradictory is a disastrous way to go about politics.\u201d The coalition is seeking to increase public spending on welfare and infrastructure while introducing a flat tax on individuals of 15% and on companies of 20%. \u201cThe coalition is aiming to redistribute income to poorer households, but if you do it through the tax system in this way, the government will run out of money and the welfare payments they rely on will be cut, leaving them worse off,\u201d he says. Flat taxes are well known to offer huge benefits to those who pay the most tax, while households on low incomes gain only slightly. Initially, the government would also suffer a huge drop in income. But difficult times deserve radical policies, says the coalition, which has even proposed creating a parallel electronic currency as a backdoor attempt to reduce the cost of Italian exports. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s describes the use of such \u201cmini-BoTs\u201d \u2013 named after Italian Treasury bills, known as BoTs \u2013 as calling into question the survival of Europe\u2019s monetary union and a \u201cred alert\u201d to international investors. But there is plenty of economic data that shows the coalition can take its time before making any radical decisions. For one thing, it inherits an economy that in some ways is in better shape than at any time since the 2008 crash. The country exports more than it imports, with the result that it had a balance-of-payments surplus of $46bn last year. The government runs a budget deficit that is low at 2.3% and falling. And its nominal growth rate \u2013 before inflation is taken into account \u2013 is faster than the rate at which it is borrowing, which means that Rome\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is declining. In its latest assessment, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that exports and business investment are increasingly driving a solid recovery. However, the report also gives the coalition plenty of ammunition if it wishes to assert that the economy needs radical medicine. Italy\u2019s GDP growth rate matched that of France and the UK last year, hitting 1.6%. But it is expected to fall to 1.4% this year and 1.1% the next. This arc of decline is partly explained by a decline in global growth. But it is also the result of structural problems that have dogged Italy\u2019s economy for decades. Low productivity is commonplace in regions outside the north-eastern powerhouse that runs from Milan across to Venice. Public investment is low and has been hampered in recent years as much by new public procurement rules as by tough spending limits. The level of female employment remains low by OECD standards, and results in overall employment of 58%. By contrast, the UK\u2019s employment rate is above 72%. Tax rules remain byzantine, even by European standards, and mean that a start-up company can sometimes be told to pay crippling levels of tax, even amounting to 120% of its income. It\u2019s no wonder thousands of business people try to hide their incomes until they have reached a size that takes them into a lower tax bracket. Cronyism in public life, and nepotism in the private sector, remain rife despite the efforts of Matteo Renzi\u2019s short-lived social democrat government to push through vital reforms to employment contracts. Italy\u2019s banks are stuffed with bad loans that the government has sought to alleviate, not by forcing them to write off debts, but by pumping more cash into their reserves. Last year, the government accepted an increase in its budget deficit from 1.9% to 2.3% as the price of boosting the banks\u2019 balance sheets. Unfortunately many of these institutions went back to their bad old ways and used the cash to buy Italian government debt. This can be justified only as long as the government is stable and the European Central Bank (ECB) acts as a guarantor. Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment analyst at BCA Research, says that, as a rule of thumb, investors start to get nervous about a bank\u2019s solvency when share capital \u2013 the funds held by shareholders \u2013 no longer covers net non-performing loans. \u201cOn this rule, the largest Italian banks now have \u20ac165bn of equity capital against \u20ac130bn of net non-performing loans, implying excess capital of \u20ac35bn,\u201d he said. It follows that there would be fresh doubts about Italian banks\u2019 solvency, Joshi says, if the bank\u2019s own borrowings, which amount to \u20ac350bn, become more expensive to service. They could quickly find that \u20ac35bn is whittled away by extra borrowing costs, and that would trigger a further flight of investors. The delicate state of Italian banks and public spending shows, Messori says, how carefully any Italian government must steer its course. It\u2019s a lesson that appears lost on M5S\u2019s leader, Luigi di Maio, and the League\u2019s Matteo Salvini, who is set to be sworn in as interior minister. Within hours of their second attempt at forming a government receiving the green light, they were locked in a war of words with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who told the new administration to fund its own spending programme for the poor south rather than look to the EU. His comments followed those of European Central Bank vice president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, who said any extra funding by the central bank would come with the same set of strings attached as those offered to Greece. It was a hard line that leaves the coalition on a collision course with its creditors. For a country with the third largest debt mountain after the US and Japan, the risks of a Greece-style debacle \u2013 only multiplied by 10 \u2013 cannot be discounted.",

      "bodyText": "This week, corporate America faced a test of nerve. Other giants watched as Starbucks implemented company-wide anti-bias training in an attempt to repair brand damage after the arrest of two black customers in a Philadelphia store. There was also the start of a US-European trade war. Then came Roseanne Barr\u2019s racist tweets about the former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. ABC-Disney cancelled her show but after Barr blamed her comments on her use of Ambien sleeping pills, drug giant Sanofi was forced to tweet that \u201cracism is not a known side effect\u201d of any of its medication. Finally, the comedian Samantha Bee called first daughter Ivanka Trump a \u201cfeckless cunt\u201d on her late night TV show. The White House called Bee \u201cvile and vicious\u201d and leaned on Time Warner to repudiate her. Two advertisers, Autotrader and State Farm insurance, walked away. Bee apologised, saying she \u201ccrossed a line\u201d. For big business in America, there is no safe political ground. Its willingness to support Trump cooled dramatically after the president equivocated over racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August. Soon after, corporate America was identified collectively by conservative media as \u201cpart of the opposition\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stay out of the fray,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School and author of Forged in Crisis, who said that from her 30 years as a business historian, she could not think of a comparably unsettled period. \u201cThe stakes are very high and the turbulence is intensifying.\u201d Koehn said that in a striking reversal from a time when corporate America frequently ducked responsibility for fear of alienating consumer groups, corporate leaders now cannot afford to be silent on political issues, lest they risk the reputation of their companies. That new willingness to take a stand could be seen after Charlottesville, when corporate leaders abandoned Trump\u2019s business councils. \u201cI feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d wrote Kenneth Frazier, the boss of Merck, a pharma giant. It happened again after the Parkland school shootings, when Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods took assault rifles off their shelves. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more CEOs putting their stake in the ground in relation to their companies around political issues,\u201d said Koehn, who added that corporate leaders recognize \u201ca real danger that in discourse and policy what counts as the fundamental values of a democratic society are now vulnerable. There\u2019s isn\u2019t a leader I\u2019ve spoken to who isn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d The larger question of what this might mean for the future of corporate America is harder to answer. \u201cThe simple answer is that it means nothing good,\u201d said Koehn. \u201cThere is nothing good for business leaders in the turbulence that is being fomented by the president and his administration without rhyme and reason or any attention on the long-term stability of the US economy.\u201d What, for instance, should a manager at Anheuser-Busch do or say about buying aluminium for beer cans when a metals trade war has been threatened for the past four months? There may be 50 such examples like that, Koehn said, that \u201cthe purposeful turbulence is making it very difficult for business leaders of any stripe to make smart bets in this environment\u201d. One answer to more sociological concerns, said Jenny Abramson of the diversity-conscious venture capital fund Rethink Impact, is to stress gender and racial diversity. An area once largely avoided is now considered a bulwark against chaos, she said. Simply put, it is bad business to risk being identified as racist, sexist or intolerant. \u201cWhen you put the cultural awareness of #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up with business data on gender and racial diversity,\u201d Abramson said, \u201cyou can see it\u2019s good for the world and good for business. It may have taken going to another extreme to get people here, but its affecting a real change in US business.\u201d Trump may be only reinforcing a longer-term trend for business to become more outspoken, said Koehn, but his administration has effectively forced companies to expand their view of social responsibility. \u201cThe job of government is not being done,\u201d she said. \u201cSo business leaders are trying to step in. Are they doing it perfectly? No. But this is an unprecedented situation. They\u2019re trying to learn to do it, in their own ways, and with respect to their stakeholders.\u201d",

Bee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamsambee/status/1002252496532856832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F05%2F31%2Fpolitics%2Fsamantha-bee-ivanka-trump%2Findex.html\">apologised</a>, saying she \u201ccrossed a line\u201d.</p> <p>For big business in America, there is no safe political ground. Its willingness to support Trump cooled dramatically after the president equivocated over racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August. Soon after, corporate America was identified collectively by conservative media as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/17/corporate-antifa-ceos-revolt-against-american-democracy/\">part of the opposition</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stay out of the fray,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School and author of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nancykoehn.com/splash.html\">Forged in Crisis</a>, who said that from her 30 years as a business historian, she could not think of a comparably unsettled period. \u201cThe stakes are very high and the turbulence is intensifying.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re seeing more CEOs putting their stake in the ground in relation to their companies around political issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Koehn said that in a striking reversal from a time when corporate America frequently ducked responsibility for fear of alienating consumer groups, corporate leaders now cannot afford to be silent on political issues, lest they risk the reputation of their companies.</p> <p>That new willingness to take a stand could be seen after Charlottesville, when corporate leaders abandoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/donald-trump-advisory-councils-disbanded-ceos-charlottesville\">Trump\u2019s business councils</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d wrote Kenneth Frazier, the boss of Merck, a pharma giant.</p> <p>It happened again after the Parkland school shootings, when Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/dicks-sporting-goods-guns-assault-rifle\">took assault rifles off their shelves</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more CEOs putting their stake in the ground in relation to their companies around political issues,\u201d said Koehn, who added that corporate leaders recognize \u201ca real danger that in discourse and policy what counts as the fundamental values of a democratic society are now vulnerable. There\u2019s isn\u2019t a leader I\u2019ve spoken to who isn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d</p> <p>The larger question of what this might mean for the future of corporate America is harder to answer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c7f987ace04e657b858430071643044f9fa778b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c7f987ace04e657b858430071643044f9fa778b/77_133_3841_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ABC this week cancelled Roseanne Barr\u2019s show after she tweeted a racist insult.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ABC this week cancelled Roseanne Barr\u2019s show after she tweeted a racist insult.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe simple answer is that it means nothing good,\u201d said Koehn. \u201cThere is nothing good for business leaders in the turbulence that is being fomented by the president and his administration without rhyme and reason or any attention on the long-term stability of the US economy.\u201d</p> <p>What, for instance, should a manager at Anheuser-Busch do or say about buying aluminium for beer cans when a metals trade war has been threatened for the past four months? There may be 50 such examples like that, Koehn said, that \u201cthe purposeful turbulence is making it very difficult for business leaders of any stripe to make smart bets in this environment\u201d.</p> <p>One answer to more sociological concerns, said Jenny Abramson of the diversity-conscious venture capital fund Rethink Impact, is to stress gender and racial diversity. An area once largely avoided is now considered a bulwark against chaos, she said. Simply put, it is bad business to risk being identified as racist, sexist or intolerant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/trump-trade-war-global-peace-president\">Trump\u2019s trade war threatens global peace | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you put the cultural awareness of #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up with business data on gender and racial diversity,\u201d Abramson said, \u201cyou can see it\u2019s good for the world and good for business. It may have taken going to another extreme to get people here, but its affecting a real change in US business.\u201d</p> <p>Trump may be only reinforcing a longer-term trend for business to become more outspoken, said Koehn, but his administration has effectively forced companies to expand their view of social responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cThe job of government is not being done,\u201d she said. \u201cSo business leaders are trying to step in. Are they doing it perfectly? No. But this is an unprecedented situation. They\u2019re trying to learn to do it, in their own ways, and with respect to their stakeholders.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of small businesses based in railway arches across the UK are facing \u201cextermination\u201d as Network Rail seeks to push through a billion-pound asset sale. From bakers to bike shops, mechanics to restaurants, many of the 5,500 arches across the UK\u2019s major cities are home to traders and shop owners. But since announcing they would be selling their commercial property business, Network Rail has been accused of trying to strong-arm many of them out of their arches with threats of eviction if rent increases of between 300% and 500% are not met. There are also fears about what will happen to the businesses when the sale goes through, with a number of private equity firms interested in acquiring the vast block of real estate. An action group called Guardians of the Arches has been set up in response and is being backed by Big Issue founder Lord John Bird. George Grant, 56, who owns Clapham North MOT in London and co-founded the action group, said Network Rail told him his rent would be increased fivefold. He took on the business from his 93-year-old father Ronnie, a second world war D-day veteran who set it up in an arch 60 years ago. \u201cAt the time Network Rail couldn\u2019t get rid of the arches, they just wanted people to come in and look after them,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWhen my father moved in there were three light bulbs and that was it, so he set about renovating it and they said do what you want as long as you pay your rent. \u201cThey have absolutely never looked after us. We have built a business in those arches to serve the community. \u201cThese businesses are the lifeblood of the communities of this country but Network Rail don\u2019t understand this. They are basically exterminating the small business entrepreneurs in this country. \u201cWith this sale of the assets nobody has been consulted. The government just said we are going to sell the arches. There was no consultation with the tenants or the general public. And the public don\u2019t want their local businesses to be exterminated, because they use them.\u201d This story is being repeated across the country, leaving business owners facing an uncertain future. Dipak Patel, 39, runs a cafe and repair shop called Popup Bikes in Manchester with his brother Prakash, but is facing the threat of having to pack up and leave if his three-month rolling lease ends. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s how big business works. It\u2019s what they do, in search of profits the little guy gets shoved to the side. \u201cThe important thing here is the public know this is going on and how it will affect them in the future. What will it leave them with in their cities and towns? What will happen if the nice independent coffee shop that used to be there will get replaced by a multinational chain? \u201cWe are a hub for the community. Before we came in six years ago there were just smackheads hanging around. People couldn\u2019t even park their cars here but now they can as the whole area has improved. But all that will go out the window if we are forced to leave. \u201cWhat we will end up with is a monoculture where there are no Popup Bikes, no great MOT places, just the same big chains everywhere. There will be no choice and we just have to buy the same stuff that everyone else buys.\u201d According to reports, there are said to be around 20 parties interested in the \u00a31.2bn rail property arm, including private equity firms Terra Firma and Blackstone. But Guardians of the Arches says momentum is starting to build and they have gained 3,500 signatures in just one week on a letter addressed to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, which they plan to deliver to Downing Street this month. Leni Jones, 38, whose husband Marcus established Rosso Corse, a Ducati specialist based in Bethnal Green, said they feel like they are being held to ransom by Network Rail. Jones acts as a director of Guardians of the Arches after being told Rosso Corse\u2019s rent would increase almost fourfold. \u201cWe feel we are being held to ransom, they\u2019ve given us zero time to relocate and they\u2019ve removed all our security by taking away our security of tenure. And they own all the arches so they control the entire market,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not opposed to rent reviews, but what they are proposing is not comparable to what is charged locally. The business is our baby and what it represents to us is the culmination of my husband\u2019s journey and all the love we\u2019ve put into it. \u201cWhen we received the letter we felt very alone and so started talking to our neighbours to find out their situations and found out a number of the arches on our road are in the same situation, all given rent increases in excess of 300%, with the threat of eviction. \u201cThis is where the concept came from, we shouldn\u2019t be facing Network Rail alone, we should pool this knowledge and speak as a group. We\u2019ll happily sit down and negotiate.\u201d Network Rail refused to comment on why certain tenants were facing rent increases of between 300% and 500% but said they aim to make rents competitive. A spokesman said: \u201cThe sale of Network Rail\u2019s arches will enable the company to raise funds to reinvest in much-needed railway projects to expand and improve the railway network for the benefits of millions of daily users. \u201cRent reviews happen as tenancies expire, which can be as long as seven years. We benchmark against similar commercial premises in the local area and aim our rents at the lower end to make them competitive. \u201cSome areas have seen marked regeneration in recent years, which can lead to increased rents but we will always do our best to stagger any increase.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2018. The original said that Rosso Corse was London\u2019s only Ducati service centre.",
