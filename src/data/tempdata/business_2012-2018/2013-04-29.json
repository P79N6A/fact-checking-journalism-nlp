The harms we have found include HIV and malaria outbreaks, shortages of essential medicines, lost healthcare access, and an avoidable epidemic of alcohol abuse, depression and suicide, among others. \"Our politicians need to take into account the serious, and in some cases profound, health consequences of economic choices. But so far, Europe's leaders have been in denial of the evidence that austerity is costing lives.\" The evidence Stuckler and Basu use from the UK includes a drop in National Health Service satisfaction rates that has coincided with cuts, as well as a jump in the number of families pushed into homelessness since the austerity drive started. Basu said: \"Ultimately, what we show is that worsening health is not an inevitable consequence of economic recessions; it's a political choice. Austerity is bad for your health. But there is another way. In this book, we show how a new New Deal could work to improve economies and our nations' health.\"",

      "bodyText": "Business minister Michael Fallon has fired the starting gun on a \u00a33bn privatisation of Royal Mail and described the sell-off as a \"practical, logical, commercial decision\". At least 10% of the shares will be handed to Royal Mail employees, but the government refused to say whether staff would get the shares free or at a discount. \"I strongly believe that employees should share in the company's future success and dividends,\" Fallon said in a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank on Monday night. \"And it is our intention to have such a scheme in place at the time we conduct a sale of Royal Mail.\" It will be the largest employee share scheme since the privatisation of British Gas 26 years ago. About 140,000 postmen and women and delivery office workers are expected to each collect shares worth about \u00a31,500 on average. The public will also be able to buy shares alongside banks and institutional investors. The government is likely to launch an advertising blitz along the lines of the \"Tell Sid\" campaign to encourage the sale of British Gas shares in 1986. Fallon said that unless Royal Mail passed into private hands, it would not be able to access equity markets, without which \"every \u00a31 it borrows is another \u00a31 on the national debt\". The sell-off will formally begin on Tuesday with the government issuing tendering documents to banks to prepare for Royal Mail's flotation on the London Stock Exchange before April 2014. It is the most ambitious sale of a state-owned business since the railways were privatised in the 1990s. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was attracted to an initial public offering (IPO) flotation as \"the preferred method of sale\", but Royal Mail could be sold to a trade buyer, sovereign wealth fund or private equity house. Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, famously refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". But Fallon, Tory MP for Sevenoaks, said the government's decision to go ahead with the sale of the 497-year-old postal service was \"not based on ideology\". The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said postal workers oppose privatisation, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\". Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, said: \"Privatisation is an old-fashioned idea. We don't believe it's in the interests of customers, the workforce or the wider industry. We want a modern Royal Mail in full public ownership and able to deliver the universal service six days a week to all parts of the UK.\" He said postal workers would not \"sell their soul\" for a 10% stake in the company. \"Postal workers up and down the country know there are no free lunches,\" he said. \"What they want is real money in their pockets. Postal workers know that privatisation would mean the break-up of the company, more job losses, worse terms and conditions and attacks on their pensions. It would be a wrecking ball to the industry they work in.\" Fallon promised that privatisation would not threaten Royal Mail's pledge to deliver mail six days a week to villages as well as cities at the same prices (pdf). \"A change of ownership in Royal Mail will not mean that Royal Mail can stop delivering to rural areas,\" he said. \"Royal Mail will remain the UK's designated universal postal service provider and must continue to provide a six-day-a-week service throughout the UK.\" A forerunner to Royal Mail was set up by Henry VIII in 1516. The General Post Office (GPO) was established in 1660 and adhesive postage stamps introduced in 1840.",

      "bodyText": "High street bakery chain Greggs has warned that its profits this year will fall short of expectations, blaming cold weather, tough competition and \"promiscuous\" shoppers for an unexpected fall in sales of sausage rolls and sandwiches. The announcement, just four months into the chain's financial year, sent Greggs' shares tumbling nearly 9%, or 40p, to 423p - their lowest level for more than three years. The baker did not reveal how far profits would fall, saying only they would be \"slightly below the lower end of the range of market expectations\" of \u00a347.5m. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the main cause of Greggs' problems was customers being drawn away by rivals. Greggs saw like-for-like sales in the 17 weeks to the end of April fall 4.4% because of the snow in January and some of the coldest March weather in 50 years. However, sales have failed to bounce back in recent weeks, falling 1.5% in the last fortnight compared with a weak April last year. Whiteside said: \"We are not putting this all down to the weather. The trend of the last few weeks shows there are fewer customers shopping. \"This is drawing us to the conclusion that weather can no longer be a factor [in the decline].\" Last year Greggs' profits fell for the first time in five years, with Whiteside blaming the poor weather for a 2.2% fall in pretax profits to \u00a352m, with underlying sales down 2.7%. However, he now believes part of the fall could be due to casual customers opting for rivals. \"Customers have become more promiscuous, looking for the best deal. The economy has been bumping along the bottom and there has been a compounding effect which means people have to be very careful about the pound in their pocket.\" He said the company's stores in traditional high street locations were suffering as customers saved money by eating at home. At the same time sites in railway stations and commuter hubs - or \"non-conventional\" locations - were trading well. That means 75% of new stores will be located away from the high street, with an increase in promotions, following successful breakfast and lunch meal deals. Whiteside said: \"There's a growing trend of people shopping online, which means they are not going to the high street.\" Sales in the past 17 weeks were up 3%, as a result of 18 store openings, a successful partnership with Moto service stations and an extension of Greggs-branded frozen food sold in Iceland supermarkets. Whiteside said: \"We do not think the supermarket sales are cannibalising our own store sales. \"We've looked at this very closely but cannot find any evidence of this. They are two separate markets.\"",

This was an ambitious government programme.</p> <p>He talked about introducing a new electoral law; reforming the constitution to give the lower and upper houses of parliament different roles, and abolishing an entire level of government (that of the provincial administrations). But the latter was one of the few indications of where Letta intended to get the cash for what appear to be ambitious plans to boost spending and cut taxes.</p> <p>This was the second point, and I\u2019m not entirely sure that the markets \u2013 understandably relieved that the political deadlock here has been broken \u2013 have taken it on board. Letta said he would drop an unpopular tax on first homes that brought several billion last year. He plans to reduce employers\u2019 contributions (the \u2018tax on jobs\u2019) and he said he was mulling a safety net benefit for families in difficulty because of the recession.</p> <p>&#xa0;This is all fine stuff, and it is in line with what many economists would recommend. But it\u2019s not exactly the kind of fiscal austerity that Berlin (and the markets, for the most part) have continued to demand of southern European countries like Italy.</p> <p>&#xa0;Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s people were visibly delighted.

      "bodyText": "Having won tonight's test, Enrico Letta's government faces a second vote of confidence on Tuesday in the Senate. That vote, though, could be overshadowed by his visit to Berlin to meet Angela Merkel. Letta's vow to spare Italy from the threat of death through 'fiscal consolidation alone' could set up a clash with the German chancellor. Here's AP's take on tonight's vote: Italy's new government has easily won a confidence vote of confirmation in the lower house of Parliament. Premier Enrico Letta's coalition of rival political blocs won the backing of the Chamber of Deputies on Monday night in a mandatory confidence vote on his coalition. The Chamber voted 453 to approve the government, and 153 voted no. The government faces a required second vote Tuesday in the Senate, where Letta's center-left forces don't have the majority. But media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's center-right party, which is part of the tense coalition government, is expected to give Letta sufficient backing. Earlier, Letta told the Chamber's lawmakers he intended to lower the tax burden on Italians in hopes of stimulating economic growth. That's all for tonight. I'll be back tomorrow - until then, goodnight, and thanks. GW Finally, news from Rome - the Italian government has won its confidence vote in the lower house of parliament, by a comfortable margin of 453 votes versus 153. One other thing to flag up tonight -- the Cyprus government has said it plans to limit the immunity from prosecution enjoyed by its president, Nicos Anastasiades. It's an attempt to rebuild public confidence in the nation's government following the traumatic way in which its bailout was handled. Reuters has full details: Cyprus to limit president's immunity from prosecution. (thanks to reader Hill777 in the comments below for flagging up) A quick recap on the sitation tonight, while we wait for the result of the vote of confidence in the Italian parliament. \u2022 Italy's new prime minister, Enrico Letta, has pledged to pursue a new growth agenda at home and across Europe, in his first speech since taking office. Letta opened a confidence debate in the lower house of the Italian parliament by warning that Italy faces a serious economic situation. The 46-year old declared that the country desperately needed a new economic strategy, saying: We will die of fiscal consolidation alone, growth policies cannot wait any longer. Letta, who is due in Berlin for talks with Angela Merkel on Tuesday, told MPs that he would cut workplace taxes, and make it more affordable for firms to employ young peope. He also pledged to reform the welfare system, abolish the housing tax introduced by his predessor, Mario Monti, and hopefully cancel a planned rise in sales tax due this summer. We have highlights of Letta's speech from 2.23pm onwards, with photos at 3.22pm \u2022 Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, said Letta had offered an \"an ambitious government programme\". The lack of commitment to austerity might concern Germany, though (see 3.56pm for John's reaction in full). \u2022 Letta's speech came after the financial markets responded positively to the news of a new government in Italy. Shares rallied in Milan and Italian government bonds strengthened, driving down the yield (or interest rate). (see 5.11pm for closing prices) \u2022 Italy also sold \u20ac6bn of new government debt at the lowest yields since October 2010. Some analysts, though, questioned whether the country was really such a safe credit risk (see 10.31am onwards). And in other eurozone news... \u2022 Spanish retail sales continued to slump in the face of its ongoing recession. They tumbled 8.9% on a year-on-year basis in March (see 9.25am). \u2022 Eurozone consumer and economic confidence also remained worryingly low, according to the latest survey from the EC (see 10.16am) And tomorrow... the Cyprus government will vote on the terms of its bailout plan (see 6.02pm). Tomorrow, we're expecting the Cypriot parliament to vote on the terms of its own bailout package. The government is expected to narrowly win. But, as the Open Europe think tank flags up, it could be close..... amid talk that Cyprus could yet quit the eurozone. Open Europe has also published an interesting piece about how German politicians have been unphased by a strong attack on Angela Merkel from the French socialist party (so far, anyway): Sorry - who are you again? The rather indifferent German response to French socialists' attack on Merkel Standard &amp; Poor's has announced tonight that the creation of the new Italian coalition has 'no immediate implications\" to the country's credit rating. S&amp;P indicated that Enrico Letta will struggle to bring in the pro-growth reforms he spoke about today. A tag cloud analysis of Enrico Letta's speech shows that the new prime minister didn't say much about one of the key challenges facing Italy - how to liberalise and reform its economy: That's from Europa - click here to see the original. Angelino Alfano, the deputy leader of the new Italian government (and key member of the centre-right), has welcomed Enrico Letta's speech. And as our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, points out, that won't displease the head of the radical Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo, who has already denounced the coalition as a cosy stitch-up betweeen the established parties: Europe's stock markets have given the new Italian government a cautious welcome today, with the main indices all closing higher - led by Milan. As Chris Beauchamp of IG Index explains: Investors may not have broken open the champagne to celebrate Mr Letta\u2019s incumbency, but any progress in the tortured world of Italian politics is to be welcomed. He now faces the problem of balancing the demands of bond markets with the expectations of an austerity-weary Italian populace, but the \u2018grand coalition\u2019 nature of his administration raises hope that the Italians will unite behind him to put the eurozone crisis firmly behind them. Italian FTSE MIB: up 364 points at 16929, + 2.2% Spanish IBEX: up 153 points at 8450, + 1.85% FTSE 100: up 31 points at 6458, + 0.5% German DAX: up 58.7 points at 7873, + 0.75% French CAC: up 58.6 points at 3868, +1.5% Enrico Letta is expected to hold talks with the head of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, on Wednesday after his meeting with Angela Merkel tomorrow night: Enrico Letta's pledge to create a new growth strategy for Italy should be welcomed in the US, which hasn't hidden its frustration over Europe's economic plans. Last night, Barack Obama said he hopes to work with Enrico Letta to stimulate economic growth, in an official statement from the White House congratulating Letta and his ministers. The United States and Italy share an enduring and essential friendship -- one built on shared values and common commitment to promote peace, liberty, and prosperity both regionally and across the globe, including as NATO allies. The President looks forward to working closely with Prime Minister Letta and President Napolitano as our two countries jointly seek to promote trade, jobs, and growth on both sides of the Atlantic and tackle today\u2019s complex security challenges. Earlier this month, Treasury secretary Jack Lew visited Brussels to urge leaders to stimulate economic demand. And here's Associated Press's first take on the Letta speech: Italy's new premier says his broad coalition will work to heal the nation's finances while encouraging economic growth. Enrico Letta is laying out his vision Monday of a pro-European Italy focused on spurring investments and job creation. The center-left leader, who has brought media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's conservatives together in a tense coalition, is seeking support as he faces for confidence votes in Parliament. Appeasing Berlusconi, Letta said Italians won't have to pay an unpopular property tax this June while a system fairer to the less affluent is devised. Financial markets have already signaled approval of this apparent end of the months-long political deadlock. Letta says he'll soon go to Brussels, Berlin and Paris to reassure EU allies about Italian economic seriousness. Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, provides this rapid analysis of Enrico Letta's speech this afternoon: Two things strike me immediately about Letta\u2019s speech. The first is that it was not that of a man who expects to pass a few basic reforms and then clear off. This was an ambitious government programme. He talked about introducing a new electoral law; reforming the constitution to give the lower and upper houses of parliament different roles, and abolishing an entire level of government (that of the provincial administrations). But the latter was one of the few indications of where Letta intended to get the cash for what appear to be ambitious plans to boost spending and cut taxes. This was the second point, and I\u2019m not entirely sure that the markets \u2013 understandably relieved that the political deadlock here has been broken \u2013 have taken it on board. Letta said he would drop an unpopular tax on first homes that brought several billion last year. He plans to reduce employers\u2019 contributions (the \u2018tax on jobs\u2019) and he said he was mulling a safety net benefit for families in difficulty because of the recession. This is all fine stuff, and it is in line with what many economists would recommend. But it\u2019s not exactly the kind of fiscal austerity that Berlin (and the markets, for the most part) have continued to demand of southern European countries like Italy. Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s people were visibly delighted. But I suspect that Letta will be in for a rather cautious welcome when he goes to see Mrs Merkel tomorrow. Shares on the Italian stock market have rallied higher as Enrico Letta outlined his legislative plans. The FTSE MIB is now up 345 points, or 2.1%, at 16911. Enrico Letta will fly to Berlin on Tuesday night for talks with Angela Merkel, part of a flying trip around key European capitals. The German government just announced that the two leaders will hold a press conference around 6pm local time (5pm BST) before having dinner together. Here's a couple of photos of Italy's new prime minister speaking at this afternoon's vote of confidence debate, in which he pledged to deliver economic growth, reform welfare provision and clean up the Italian political system (see 2.23pm onwards) And here's a photo of MPs applauding Pier Luigi Bersani, who is stepping down as Democratic Party (PD) leader. After failing to agree a coalition deal himself, Bersani must now watch his former deputy, Letta, take power. Turning to the Italian electoral system, Letta told parliament that Italy must make a commitment to making reforms in time for the next election. This is a key demand from Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, who has threatened to resign unless changes were made. Letta said his government would examine the state of progress in 18 months, and warned of 'consequences' (which weren't defined) if the process were blocked. Enrico Letta's government will cut ministers' \"supplementary salaries\" and other benefits, as part of a drive to cut spending. He also told parliament he would work with Italy's unions to bring down unemployment: We need a welfare system which is more universal, more focused on young people and women, extending it to those who are not covered, especially temporary workers. Plans to increase Italy's VAT rate by 1 percentage point, to 22%, will be dropped. Here's the key quote from Enrico Letta's speech this afternoon, explainign the urgent need for growth: We will die of fiscal consolidation alone, growth policies cannot wait any longer. (that's via Reuters). Enrico Letta is pledging to reduce taxes on workers and young people, in a drive to stimulate economic growth. He also said he would halt the unpopular IMU housing tax from June, as demanded by Silvio Berlusconi (see 11.28am for details). That should ensure the support of Berlusconi's PdL party in this evening's vote. Letta also vowed to fight corruption in the Italian system by strengthening its justice system. Enrico Letta, the new Italian prime minister, is teling MPs in Rome that Italy faces a \"serious economic situation\". He kicked off today's confidence debate by warning that the country simply cannot cope without new policies for growth. Letta told MPs that he would visit Brussels, Paris and Berlin this week to meet fellow EU leaders and top officials and demonstrate that he is still committed to Italy's budget targets. But he also insisted that Europe must change its approach to the financial crisis, so that it can become a \"motor for growth\". More to follow Enrico Letta has begun speaking in the Italian parliament, as today's confidence debate gets underway (with a vote scheduled for around 8pm CET). The Bank of Italy has warned that bad debts across the country's banking sector will continue to rise this year. BOI's latest financial stability report shows that 7.2% of all corporate loans are now in arrears, led by the building industry. It warned that the situation is getting worse: There is an increase above all in bad loans to companies, especially in the construction sector.. According to leading indicators a further deterioration is underway. Not surprising, given Italy's economy is set to keep shrinking this year. Consumer prices in Germany fell by 0.5% in April compared with March, and were just 1.2% higher than a year ago, according to fresh inflation data released this afternoon. That might just make it even easier for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates when it meets on Thursday (although whether that would do much good is a moot point ...) CNBC has published a nice piece about Italy's new economy minister, Fabrizio Saccomanni, and his close links to the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi: It explains that Saccomanni's job is to reassure the financial markets that Italy hasn't lost its commitment to fiscal responsibility: When Mario Draghi left the Italian central bank to go to the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2011, he backed his number two to replace him - only for then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to oppose the move. Now that Fabrizio Saccomanni has \"made it\" to head the economy ministry, markets may expect him to be the ECB's new man in Rome. \"Saccomanni is definitely the guy that can keep the dialogue open between Italy and the European Central bank,\" Giada Giani, European economist at Citigroup told CNBC on Monday. \"He was Draghi's appointed number two at the Italian central bank so he was already his man within the bank. He was definitely one of the favorite guys to succeed him when he left to go to the ECB,\" Giani added. Here's the full article: Is Italy's Economy Minister Draghi's Man in Rome? Saccomanni gave a fairly broad-brush interview yesterday in which he suggested that he would aim to cut taxes, \"restructure the state budget\" and cut wasteful areas of public spending (Reuters has more details). We should get more details in this afternoon's condidence debate (which starts around 2pm BST). In Milan, the main Italian stock index is up 1.5% this lunchtime - as the stock market rally following the creation of Enrico Letta's new government continues. Italian government bonds have also continued to strengthen, pushing down yields (Italy's implicit cost of borrowing) following today's succesful bond sale (see 10.31am onwards). \u2022 10-year Italian bonds yields: down 12.5 basis points at 3.94%. And here's the latest stock market prices: Italian FTSE MIB: up 239 points at 16084, +1.44% FTSE 100: up up 6 points at 6432, + 0.1% German DAX: up 29 points at 7841, + 0.35% Spanish IBEX: up 85 points at 8383, + 1.0% French CAC: up 34 points at 3844, +0.8% J\u00f6rg Asmussen, the German member of the European Central Bank's governing council, insisted today that the eurozone will survive the current crisis, and emerge from it in a stronger position -- with more countries joining it in future. Speaking in Berlin today, Asmussen insisted that it still makes sense for some nations, particularly in Eastern Europe, to join the eurozone despite the current crisis. He cited lower transaction costs and the removal of exchange rate risks. Asmussen said: I recognise that, at present, the euro area is not an excellent advertisement for stability given the difficulties facing a number of its members. I also think it is important not to read too much into the current situation. Latvia remains on track to become the 18th member of the euro area, having filed its application in March. Back to Greece briefly, and the latest opinion poll data shows that New Democracy (the senior member of the coalition) holds a narrow lead over the opposition Syriza party. ND has 20.5% support, followed by Syriza with 19.9%. Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi group, is third with 9.3%. Angela Merkel has phoned Enrico Letta to wish him luck, and to invite the new Italian prime minister to the German capital soon. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, has just tweeted: Chancellor Merkel has spoken by phone with PM Letta, wished his government success and invited him to a visit to Berlin soon Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper,. reports heightened security in Rome following the shooting of two policemen yesterday: Germany's Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmarker, admitted this morning that it has been hit by the slump in demand for new vehicles in Europe. Operating profits at its VW brand are down by 45% in the first three months of 2013, as profits margins are squeezed by the recession. Chief executive Martin Winterkorn explained: The current environment is definitely a tough challenge for the entire industry. Europe's car industry has been emitting danger signs for months. In March, sales tumbled by over 10% (as covered here in the liveblog last week). Ansa, the Italian news agency, reports that Letta will give his speech to the Italian parliament at 3pm local time, or 2pm BST. The actual confidence vote is scheduled for 8pm CET, or 7pm BST. Robin Bew, editorial director and chief economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that Enrico Letta's government could soon be blown apart. Bew fears that disagreements between Letta's Democratic Party (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi's People of Liberty (PdL ) could force Italy back to the polls this year. One particular \"old\" policy is already looming over the new government -- the housing tax imposed by Mario Monti. PdL wants to hear Letta promise today to abolish the tax and repay the money already paid (around \u20ac8bn in total). If not, the party is threatening not to back the coalition. Renato Brunetta, its leader in the lower house, told the Il Messaggero news paper: If the prime minister doesn't make this precise commitment we will not give him our support in the vote of confidence. (more details here on Reuters). Here's an early round-up of analyst reaction to today's successful Italian debt sale (see 10.31am) (via Reuters) Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy reckons that today's sale was \"brilliantly timed\", as the fears following February's inconclusive general election faded away. While post-crisis market sentiment towards Italy has never been better, economic conditions have never been worse - as this morning's bleak business and economic confidence surveys show..... The disconnect between Italy's bond market and the real economy is likely to increase further in the coming days and weeks. This will throw the mispricing of Italian sovereign debt into sharper relief, particularly given concerns about the durability of Mr Letta's government. Spiro added that Italy's ability to borrow at below 4% for 10-years today was \"one of the greatest anomalies in European sovereign credit\". Meanwhile Luca Cazzulani of Unicredit was cheered by the auction results: The positive outcome of the auction reflects an improved situation compared with the previous auctions, helped by the announcement of a new government. The government still needs a confidence vote but this is not perceived as a problem. Success for Italy in the bond markets this morning, as traders give an early thumbs-up to prime minister Enrico Letta. The Italian Treasury has sold its five and ten-year bonds at the lowest interest rates since October 2010. Here's the details: \u2022 \u20ac3bn of 10-year bonds sold at average yields of 3.94%, down from 4.66% last time. \u2022\u20ac3bn of 5-year bonds at average yields of 2.84%, down from 3.65% last time. That's reassuring news for Enrico Letta as he gets down to business in Rome. Unlike Mario Monti, whose first task 18 months ago was to win back the confidence of the financial markets, Letta's priorities are domestic -- fixing the bleeding economy and reforming the political landscape. Consumers and businesses acrosst the eurozone remain gloomy about the economic situation, data just released showed. The European commission's monthly measure of economic sentiment fell this month to 88.6, down from March's 90.1. Firms also reported that their business climate has deteriorated this month. Consumer sentiment improved slightly, but was still deep in negative territory - at minus 22.3, from minus 23.5 in March. There were protests in Athens yesterday as the Greek government approved legislation that will mean 15,000 civil servants are laid off by the end of next year. Demonstrators marched past the parliament building, and also burned an effigy of a Greek worker, as MPs debated the bills. The legislation was passed despite the protests, meaning Greece will now receive its next tranche of bailout loans, worth around \u20ac8.8bn. The debate was pretty lively, especially after finance minister Yannis Stournaras introduced a last-minute amendment that would allow firms to avoid paying the minimum wage Greece's Kathimerini has details: Opposition parties complained that the amendment was submitted without prior notice and only a few minutes before the vote was due to take place. They also complained that the minimum wage was being by-passed. Stournaras defended the measure. \u201cIt is true that \u20ac490 is a low wage but do not forget that in these cases we are talking about unemployed people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a relief for them.\u201d Another piece of grim economic news from Spain - Spanish retail sales fell by a jaw-dropping 8.9% year-on-year in March, the thirty-third monthly decline in a row, following a 7.7% decline in Febuary. Another signal that the slump in Spain is actually getting worse, following last Thursday's record unemployment data. The Atlantic ran a very good blogpost on the jobless crisis in Spain over the weekend: Spain Is Beyond Doomed: The 2 Scariest Unemployment Charts Ever Here's one of the charts: and here's a flavour of the piece: Here's the story of Spanish unemployment in three acts. During the boom, joblessness was relatively high due to persistent structural problems. Then it shot up fast and faster as Spain's building bust and then Lehmangeddon hit in 2008. But it has kept climbing up since the panic abated, albeit at a less catastrophic pace, due to the toxic combination of too tight money and budgets. In other words, austerity hasn't been the path to prosperity. It's been the path to perma-slump. But the real story of the Spanish depression has been the story of the indignados: the mostly young, long-term unemployed. It's a bit hard to see just how dramatic it's been in the chart above, so I converted it to a line chart below. Almost all of the increase in unemployment since 2010 has been due to the increase in long-term unemployment of two years or more. Bond market-maker Gus Baratta has the details of this morning's Italian bond sale, which takes place in around 90 minutes time: Shares are rattling higher in Milan too. The FTSE MIB Index has risen 283 points at 16846, up 1.7%. Letta's appointment, though, doesn't mean Italy is out of the woods -- and analysts are warning that the new PM must quickly devise a coherent economic plan. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets points out that Letta must maintain working relations with the centre-right PDL party, and his eurozone partners. The new government will face its first test of cohesion soon enough in June with respect to a new housing tax which Berlusconi\u2019s party has demanded be scrapped, and could well also stress test the new Italian governments relationship with Brussels and Berlin. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, also senses trouble ahead: Italian sovereign debt is rising in value this morning as traders welcome the news that Enrico Letta's government has been sworn in. This has pushed the yield on its 10-year bonds down to 3.97%, from 4.06% on Friday (and down from over 7% eighteen months ago, when Mario Monti took over). That suggests this morning's bond auction could be a success... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone and the wider global economy. A new era is underway in Italy today as the government led by Prime minister Enrico Letta gets to work, and announces how it will tackle the economic and political crisis raging in the country. Having been sworn in on Sunday, Letta's government's first task is to win a confidence vote in the Italian parliament. While that shouldn't be a problem for the centre-left and centre-right coalition, the debate will allow the new Italian leader to articulate his vision for the country. Letta's priorities, in his own words, are to tackle the \"enormous, unbearable\" economic emergency in Italy, change the pace of Europe's austerity programmes, and reform the discredited Italian electoral system. He takes over a country suffering a deep recession -- and which is still shaken by the shooting yesterday of two Italian policemen in Rome as the swearing-in took place. One man was hit in the neck, and a second in the leg, while the alleged gunman has been named as Luigi Preiti, 49, from Calabria, a southern agricultural area suffering high unemployment and organized crime (more details here). That attack shows the depth of the social crisis suffered by Italians, argued lower house speaker Laura Boldrini, who added: There's a social emergency that needs answers and our politicians have to start giving them. The financial markets will also give their verdict on Letta today, when the Italian Treasury holds an auction of five and 10-year government debt. That sale will be closely watched to see whether investors are still confident in buying Italian debts. I'll be tracking events in Italy, and beyond, through the day....",

The incident followed a fire in July 2011 at a platform on the Valhall field, also in the North Sea, which forced a shutdown of more than two months and was also investigated by Norway's PSA. No one was seriously injured in that incident either, but the regulator warned that the fire could easily have spread and caused fatalities. Both incidents were an embarrassment to BP, which has been under fire for its safety breaches, notably the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, which killed 11 workers and led to the worst offshore spill in US history, and the Texas City refinery disaster in 2005, in which 15 workers were killed. The PSA's investigation into the Ula leak, the results of which were made public on Monday, identified \"a number of serious breaches of the regulations, related in part to BP's management system for activities\" in Norway's North Sea oil and gas fields. The PSA issued BP with an order to review its systems. After the 2011 fire on the Valhall installation, BP was also served with similar orders to review and assess its \"maintenance management on ageing installations and ensuring that maintenance programmes and the execution of such work were tailored to the age and condition of the installations and equipment\". But even after those reviews, from its investigation of the Ula incident, the PSA has concluded that \"deficiencies still exist in the maintenance system\". The PSA said an order of the type issued to BP was \"a powerful preventive measure and legally binding on the recipient\". BP said: \"[We have] received the PSA's investigation report following the hydrocarbon leakage on Ula last year. The findings closely match BP's own investigation and work has already started to address the issues raised.\" The oil and gas leak at Ula was caused by \"fracturing of the bolts holding together a valve in a separator outlet\", the PSA found. Seepage from the valve exposed the bolts to water with a high content of chlorides at a temperature of about 120C, resulting in stress corrosion cracking, which weakened the bolts to the extent that in the end they fractured.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's struggling construction sector suffered another blow on Monday as building firm Balfour Beatty issued its second profit warning in six months. The company, whose shares tumbled nearly 14% in early trading, blamed the declining construction sector and poor management in its UK division for the announcement, which will wipe \u00a350m off profits in the current financial year. It comes less than a week after the latest GDP figures showed construction output was one of the weakest areas of the UK economy, falling 2.5% in the last quarter. A list of major Balfour Beatty projects underlines the UK building industry's reliance on government-backed schemes, with the company's signature building achievements of recent times including the Olympics Aquatics Centre, the revamp of Blackfriars rail station in London and the widening of the M25 motorway. The company told shareholders: \"The UK construction market has been a challenging environment in which to win and execute work. Market conditions which deteriorated significantly in the second half of 2012 continue to be difficult. \"Change in procurement trends, which we have previously highlighted, have persisted, allowing customers to impose increasingly stringent conditions on to contractors.\" It revealed that new chief executive, Andrew McNaughton, who joined last month, will take charge of the UK division after an internal review found significant failings and \"specific instances of poor operational delivery\". The review scrutinised nearly 1,000 contracts at Balfour Beatty's regional UK operations, including social housing and road contracts, and found problems with several deals, ranging from overruns to overspends. Most of the problems were linked to contracts in south England. Balfour Beatty was keen to stress that the profit warning was due to its UK division, highlighting that operations in Asia, the Middle East, US, Australia and Germany were in line with expectations \u2013 although there will be a \u00a310m dent to profits from its German railway operations. Analysts at Oriel Securities were unimpressed, accusing the company of reacting slowly to trends such as government delays in school building plans and a lack of power projects. \"This is somewhat disappointing given comments from peers like Kier Group that UK construction markets had not worsened over the past six months. It will cast a negative shadow over most of the sector today, but we think a lot of this is Balfour specific, being slow to react to these trends,\" said Oriel. Andy Brown, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: \"While we know that the UK market is a tough place it appears that the business review has thrown up operational issues. Clearly these need to be resolved swiftly to ensure investor confidence can return.\" A previous profit warning in November last year was also blamed on the poor UK construction sector, with a dearth of major construction projects and new public sector contracts unlikely to materialise until 2014 or 2015. The profit warning came as MPs on the public accounts committee warned that the government's \u00a3310bn plan for boosting UK infrastructure is beset with uncertainty about funding. Arguing that investment in power generation, roads and railways is \"crucial\" for economic growth, the report said: \"We are not convinced that a plan requiring \u00a3310bn of investment is credible given the economic climate, the cutbacks in public finances and the difficulty in raising private finance.\" With no new major projects on the horizon, Balfour Beatty's UK operation has already been revamped, with 650 job losses. The company, which reported a 7% fall in 2012 profit last month, has been restructuring its British construction business to reduce costs, and plans to sell most of its businesses in mainland Europe in favour of seeking growth in Australia and elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "Justin King spent much of the weekend denying he would step down as chief executive of J Sainsbury, following reports the supermarket group had appointed headhunters to find a replacement. There had been much talk King could join Formula One - his son is a racing driver who is believed to have F1 aspirations - or Marks &amp; Spencer. But King said in a TV interview: I am not planning on going anywhere. I see myself staying at Sainsbury's...I cannot see any reason why I would go to [M&amp;S]....I am not aware there is a vacancy [at F1]. Sainsbury shares have fallen 6.2p to 376.6p but that follows a downgrade by Citigroup, which has cut from buy to neutral.
