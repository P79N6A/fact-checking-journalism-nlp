      "bodyText": "Gary Mulgrew's mother had always taught him, when he was grappling with a particularly knotty dilemma, to scribble down his concerns, so he decided to approach being sent to a notoriously violent, gang-dominated jail in a Texas desert in the same way. Sitting at a bare table in his rented Houston flat, Mulgrew laid out a sheet of white paper and some coloured pens. \"PRISON\" he wrote in the centre in capitals. Then, in red, \"rape\", then \"buggery\". \"Shagged\". \"Buggery\" again. Then \"violence\", \"darkness\", \"murder\", \"extortion\", \"blackmail\", \"bitch\", \"knives\", \"death\", \"gangs\", \"gang rape\". Using different colours, he scribbled down other fears \u2013 notably the dark, a paralysing phobia since he was a very young child. Finally, on another sheet, he divided the scribbled words between two columns: \"BAD\" and \"FUCKING CATASTROPHIC\". At least the bad ones didn't look so bad. It was a technique Mulgrew had used many times in his career as an investment banker, and to no little success. Starting out as an ordinary cashier in a Glasgow branch of NatWest, he had risen rapidly to become a senior vice-president for strategy, working from Tokyo and New York, before being put in charge of Greenwich NatWest, a small, London-based investment banking subsidiary of the high street bank. He had acquired, along the way, all the trappings of the boom-times banker: big house, big salary, big bonus, big ego. But Mulgrew's management techniques \u2013 and his judgment \u2013 had failed him, and with one very bad deal his life had collapsed spectacularly; once charmed, now unquestionably catastrophic. Mulgrew's name may not be immediately familiar, but there was a time, six or so years ago, when he acquired a sudden and very strange kind of celebrity. Some years earlier, in 2000, Mulgrew and two colleagues at GNW had made seven-figure personal windfalls by quietly investing their own money in a $20m offshore deal that, it turned out, was part of an elaborate fraud against the US energy giant Enron, brokered by the company's then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The multibillion-dollar corporation, with which GNW had worked closely, would collapse the following year in one of the biggest corruption scandals in US history. As Enron tumbled, the three men \u2013 Mulgrew, David Bermingham and Giles Darby \u2013 approached the Financial Services Authority in London, they say, to report their dealings with the firm and to draw the regulator's attention to what they now realised might be a questionable deal. No action was taken by the FSA. But as US prosecutors gathered evidence against senior Enron executives, including Fastow, their attention turned to the dodgy-looking Cayman Islands deal he had cooked up involving the three British bankers. In 2002, the US sought the Britons' extradition on seven counts of fraud. It was not the facts of the case that catapulted the three to attention, but the circumstances of their extradition, under the terms of a supposedly bilateral treaty that allowed the US to seize British suspects without presenting a substantial case against them, and that Congress itself had not ratified. Newspapers wrote angry editorials; hundreds of businesspeople marched indignantly through Westminster. The Commons held an 11th-hour emergency debate during which the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, condemned the \"unfair, unequal treaty\". The press, with the enthusiastic encouragement of a canny PR campaign, dubbed the men the NatWest Three, in the manner of an egregious miscarriage of justice. It's almost laughable, Mulgrew notes drily, to imagine three millionaire bankers mustering that level of support today. \"If it happened now, people would probably get a bus and drive us over [to America].\" They lost the extradition battle in July 2006 and, after agreeing a plea bargain with US prosecutors in which they admitted one charge, were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. The funny thing is, Mulgrew says, \"People get much more bent out of shape about me being an ex-banker than they do about me being a convicted fraudster. 'You were a banker, oh my God!' Convicted fraudster was the first step of my rehabilitation.\" Mulgrew is 50 now, greyer and a little thinner than before he was extradited, and living in Brighton, where we meet in a quiet pub of which he owns a share. (Of his partners, he says, \"I've been amazingly lucky with how faithful, loyal and decent they were.\") He speaks quickly, in a strong Glasgow accent, but surprisingly softly, and with a vulnerability that is at times quite unsettling. He has now written a book, Gang Of One, about his time in Big Spring Federal Correctional Institution, one of a number of US prisons he passed through before seeing out the rest of his sentence, of which he served just over half, in Britain. It's an entertaining read, focusing on his menacing, sometimes comical dealings with his fellow inmates and the assorted gangs that competed over the prison's corridors. There is an element, perhaps inevitably, of setting the record straight, as he sees it \u2013 throughout the book, Mulgrew refers to the offence that landed him in prison as no more than a breach of his employment contract. But while he says his legal fight has virtually wiped him out financially, the book was not written for money \u2013 most of any income will go to charity. He has a much more compelling reason for telling his story. A week after Mulgrew was extradited, his ex-wife, Laura, rang to let him speak to their five-year-old daughter, Cara Katrina. The couple had separated two years earlier, in the fallout of the extradition drama, and while their son Calum, then eight, had opted to live with his father, Cara Katrina divided her time between both parents. Mulgrew's new partner had taken over Calum's care when he was extradited; he says Laura, at that time, was increasingly \"vague\" about her whereabouts. When he tried to call Cara Katrina again, the mobile number went unanswered \u2013 and he has had minimal contact with her since. Laura fled the country with her shortly after Mulgrew's extradition, later marrying a Tunisian man called Abdul. Mulgrew doesn't know where they are now. Calum has had very occasional letters from his mother via his school, but there is never a return address. \"It's about my daughter,\" Mulgrew says of the book. \"I think this is the mechanism that will probably help me find her. I'm hoping somebody will read this and will have maybe seen her. That's what I hope.\" He also wants to create a record for Cara Katrina while she's gone, to prove to her \"that I was always trying, that she was always loved and it wasn't her fault. \"Your love for your children doesn't diminish,\" he says. \"It just doesn't. And it's very, very difficult to, um\u2026 it's difficult to see\u2026 to function normally, right? Unless you feel\u2026 I have to feel every day that I've done just a little bit. It just helps me.\" Whatever his history, Mulgrew does not now fit the archetype of the bumptious banker bestriding the financial markets with unshakable self-assurance. He talks, I suggest quite early in our meeting, with the sometimes lacerating self-awareness of someone who has spent time in therapy. \"Er\u2026 A little bit. \" It's more the case, he volunteers later, that he has always carried with him a powerful sense of self-doubt and a \"terrible\" need to be liked, even when he found himself at the very top of the money tree. Mulgrew was born in 1962, the youngest of three sons, to a young Glasgow couple whose ill-starred marriage was over when he was a baby and his mother only 21. Unable to cope, she temporarily placed the boys in foster care and then, when Mulgrew was four, in an orphanage. It was here, thanks to repeatedly being locked in a garage as a punishment, that Mulgrew acquired his crippling fear of the dark. (Happily, he was to find that in his 80-man \"cell\" \u2013 more like a warehouse \u2013 in the Texas prison, the lights were never switched off.) They returned after two years to live with their mother in a Glasgow tenement; he heard nothing from his father until he was 11. His brother went back to the home once, he says, and found a report that had been written of their time there. \"It was heartbreaking. It was terrible. I had once given somebody something, a cross or something, to 'be my best friend'. They said I\u2026 They describe me as a 'needy child'. I'm kind of pissed off about that, because why wouldn't you be, for fuck's sake. Of course I was needy. \"And when I read that, it was terrible, I thought, fuck, that's me, I've lived my whole life like that. That was\u2026 that was bad. Er\u2026\" He coughs. \"That was when I was four, I think. And then, that's it. That's me, end of story.\" He carried that eagerness to please through his childhood, he says, and through Strathclyde University, where he studied business. Before he graduated, he'd already secured a job interview at NatWest. He found he was good at it, he says, and was fast-tracked by supportive bosses. \"And I'm appalled to say I had read Kane And Abel and really liked that kind of banker thing. I was quite proud of it.\" His people-pleasing tendencies may even be part of what made him so successful, he thinks. He now says he was not the only one desperate to make an impression. \"You sit in meetings and everyone is talking about mathematical stuff and 'the probability of default is zero point such-and-such based on this and this' and you're sitting looking at everyone else and thinking, do you understand this? \"Now to say, 'Hold on a minute, I'm really sorry, I don't understand this. Can you explain this to me?' That is just incredibly difficult to do. People just sat there and everybody was too frightened to ask.\" How much did he earn? He gets up and puts a log on the fire. \"Do you really want to know that? Well, I got paid more in a year than I made in that deal [the one that landed him in prison]. I got paid a phenomenal amount of money. And I'll tell you something, I never asked for it. I was amazed when I got it, and what it meant for me was\u2026 Me! Me. Look at me. I've made it in this business, I can't bloody believe it.\" He's been described by former colleagues as arrogant, I say. \"I think I had moments of extreme arrogance.\" GNW's most important relationship was with Enron, whose team hosted the wildest and most lavish business trips, and had millions at their fingertips to invest through their bankers. The company, Mulgrew now says, \"was the epitome of the capitalist model. When you went into their buildings in London or Houston, they had the share price everywhere, even in the elevators. And everybody, from the secretaries and janitors up to the big guy, got paid in shares\u2026 So almost all of them are sitting there with their own mental calculation, all the time, of how much wealthier they had got.\" He admits he was \"dazzled\" by it, and particularly by Fastow. \"He's the CFO of America's hotshot company, he's 36 years of age, an Ivy League guy. He has all those nice things in life: nice teeth, nice hair, shakes your hand properly. So when he offered me the investment, if he'd asked me to invest in a pizza parlour with him, I would have done it.\" \"The investment\", needless to say, is the most tangled part of Mulgrew's story. \"Are you going to ask me about innocence and guilt, all that?\" he asks abruptly early in our interview. The three men had insisted on their innocence of the fraud while fighting extradition; their later plea bargain was taken by some as proof of their venality. So, is he guilty? He answers with a question. \"Do you like football? Well, Kenny Dalglish, first time he was a manager, was asked after a game that ended 1-1 and he got a dubious penalty, and the guy said to him, 'Was it a penalty?' and he said, 'Of course it was. The ref gave it, so it was a penalty.' In law, it's a fact that I'm guilty. I am guilty. Definitely, I have to be. I went to jail.\" It was the turn of the millennium, and NatWest was fighting two hostile takeover bids that put in doubt the future of its hotshot investment banking division. Mulgrew, as GNW's leader, was talking secretly with a number of other banks about taking over his team wholesale. In the midst of this turmoil, he says, \"Fastow said to me, 'If you do leave, do you want to do this deal?'\" The deal involved the three men recommending to NatWest that it sell a stake it owned in an offshore investment vehicle called Swap Sub for $1m, without informing their employers who was buying it \u2013 in fact, a company controlled by Giles Darby. The three had put up $250,000 of their own money for the purchase. Fastow, meanwhile, had persuaded Enron to buy the stake for $20m. When the deal went through, he and a colleague pocketed $12.3m between them, while the three Britons shared $7.35m. (In 2002, Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to repay $23.8m in stolen money, after turning informant against his former Enron colleagues.) The US indictment on which the men were extradited stated that the men knew NatWest's Swap Sub stake was worth vastly more than they sold it for, and had conspired with Fastow to defraud Enron, at one point flying to Houston to present a seminar on how it should be conducted. \"The concept of saying, 'Right, we're going to do a presentation on how do to a fraud,' it's fucking ridiculous,\" Mulgrew says. He also disputes vigorously that he undersold the Swap Sub stake. The US quickly dropped the conspiracy line of inquiry after Fastow insisted he had acted alone. But the three accepted, as laid out in a \"statement of facts\" negotiated tortuously between prosecutors and the men's lawyers, that they were guilty of breaching NatWest's internal compliance rules that required they inform their employers of the deal \u2013 the basis of Mulgrew's assertion that he just breached his contract \u2013 and a \"theft of opportunity\" against NatWest, depriving the bank of the opportunity to make the money that they had pocketed. \"My lawyer took me out for coffee the day we were doing the statement of facts, to explain why I was signing it. And he assures me that that is known as a theft of opportunity. Did I deliberately defraud NatWest? Absolutely not.\" They took the plea bargain rather than fighting the case, he says, because every (London-based) witness they wanted to call to back up their story, now represented by NatWest's lawyers, refused to travel to testify, and losing held out a prospect of at least 20 years in prison. Guilt, though, is a mischievous thing. In the book, Mulgrew describes facing his first shift cleaning the prison toilets and experiencing \"an overpowering sense that I'd been found out, and placed where I really belonged. Maybe I deserved this prison after all. Maybe I deserved a lot worse. I'd climbed the ladder of success only to realise I'd perched my ladder against the wrong wall.\" Does he mean he took a wrong moral turn? \"There's a lot of that. Should we have seen Fastow for what he was becoming? Should we have known better? You look at some transactions\u2026 and you think, hmm, maybe we should have blown the whistle there and we didn't. I have a lot regrets about that. I have a lot of regrets about not\u2026 being strong enough as a person.\" Two months after they had done the deal with Fastow, Mugrew says, he saw him in Miami. \"Of course, I was fascinated about how he had made so much money [on the Swap Sub deal]. And, of course, I never asked him. I thought about asking him, but instead I decided to act like I did that every Tuesday, that I was cool. And when I look at that now I just\u2026 I think I was a horse's arse. Those are the kind of bits where I think I must have been polluted by it. All I did was thank him. 'Thanks very much, that was great. Maybe we'll do some more in the future.' I just stood there like a big diddy. And that's dreadful, I think.\" The consolation to his critics, he notes wryly, is that he has \"lost it all\". He spent millions on legal fees, he says, and still has debts to settle. As well as the share in the bar and \"some other ones\", all he owns is a small building company in Lewes. His priorities, though, are rebuilding his relationship with Calum, now 16, and finding Cara Katrina, the imagined horrors of whose absence, for someone who was abandoned by his own father and still lives with the legacy of childhood terrors, is, he says, a \"designer nightmare\". After Calum was born, he didn't speak to his own father for three years, he volunteers at one point (the pair had forged a relationship of sorts as he grew into adulthood), unable to deal with the enormity of what that abandonment meant. Eventually his father, who has since died, wrote Mulgrew a letter, having seen an article about him in the City press, that read: \"Congratulations. Looks like you've finally beaten me.\" \"So I phoned him, went for a drink, and eventually I said to him, 'What did you mean by that letter?' He said, 'Well, you've always been driven by me. You've always wanted to beat me.'\" That's an extraordinary thing to say to the son you abandoned until he was 11, I say. \"I think so,\" Mulgrew says. \"But that was him. I said, 'I didn't speak to you because I had a son, and I couldn't believe that you had fucked off and not been there. I can't understand that. I would never leave my kids.'\" He stops suddenly. \"That would be a good ending to a movie, wouldn't it? As I left them to go to prison. And everything that has gone wrong since.\"",

Photograph: Rex  </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's almost laughable, Mulgrew notes drily, to imagine three millionaire bankers mustering that level of support today. \"If it happened now,&#xa0;people would probably get a bus and drive us over [to America].\" They lost the extradition battle in July 2006 and, after agreeing a plea bargain with US prosecutors in which they admitted one charge, were each sentenced to 37&#xa0;months in prison.</p> <p>The funny thing is, Mulgrew says, \"People get&#xa0;much more bent out of shape about me being&#xa0;an ex-banker than they do about me being a&#xa0;convicted fraudster. 'You were a&#xa0;banker, oh my God!' Convicted fraudster was the first step of my rehabilitation.\"</p> <p>Mulgrew is 50 now, greyer and a little thinner than before he was extradited, and living in Brighton, where we meet in a quiet pub of which he owns a share. (Of his partners, he says, \"I've been amazingly lucky with how faithful, loyal and decent they were.\") He speaks quickly, in a strong Glasgow accent, but surprisingly softly, and with a vulnerability that is at times quite unsettling.</p> <p>He has now written a book, Gang Of One, about his time in <a href=\"http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/big/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Big Spring Federal Correctional Institution</a>, one of a number of US prisons he passed through before seeing out the rest of his sentence, of which he served just over half, in Britain. It's an entertaining read, focusing on his menacing, sometimes comical dealings with his fellow inmates and the assorted gangs that competed over the prison's corridors.</p> <p>There is an element, perhaps inevitably, of setting the record straight, as he sees it \u2013 throughout the book, Mulgrew refers to the offence that landed him in prison as&#xa0;no more than&#xa0;a breach of his employment contract. But&#xa0;while he&#xa0;says his legal fight has virtually wiped him out financially, the book was not written for money \u2013 most of any income will go to&#xa0;charity. He has a much more compelling reason&#xa0;for telling his story.</p> <p>A week after Mulgrew was extradited, his ex-wife, Laura, rang to let him speak to their five-year-old daughter, Cara Katrina. The couple had separated two years earlier, in the fallout of&#xa0;the extradition drama, and while their son Calum, then eight, had opted to live with his father, Cara Katrina divided her time between both parents. Mulgrew's new partner had taken over Calum's care when he was extradited; he says Laura, at that time, was increasingly \"vague\" about her whereabouts.</p> <p>When he tried to call Cara Katrina again, the mobile number went unanswered \u2013 and he has had minimal contact with her since. Laura fled the country with her shortly after Mulgrew's extradition, later marrying a Tunisian man called Abdul. Mulgrew doesn't know where they are now. Calum has had very occasional letters from&#xa0;his mother via his school, but there is never a&#xa0;return address.</p> <p>\"It's about my daughter,\" Mulgrew says of the book. \"I think this is the mechanism that will probably help me find her. I'm hoping somebody will read this and will have maybe seen her. That's what I hope.\" He also wants to create a&#xa0;record for Cara Katrina while she's gone, to prove to her \"that I was always trying, that she was always loved and it wasn't her fault.</p> <p>\"Your love for your children doesn't diminish,\" he says. \"It just doesn't. And it's very, very difficult to, um\u2026 it's difficult to see\u2026 to function normally, right? Unless you feel\u2026 I have to feel every day that I've done just a little bit. It just helps me.\"</p> <p>Whatever his history, Mulgrew does not now fit the archetype of the bumptious banker bestriding the financial markets with unshakable self-assurance. He talks, I suggest quite early in our meeting, with the sometimes lacerating self-awareness of someone who has spent time in therapy. \"Er\u2026 A little bit. \" It's more the case, he volunteers later, that he&#xa0;has always carried with him a&#xa0;powerful sense of self-doubt and a&#xa0;\"terrible\" need to be liked, even when he found himself at the very top of the money tree.</p> <p>Mulgrew was born in 1962, the youngest of three sons, to a young Glasgow couple whose ill-starred marriage was over when he was a baby and his mother only 21. Unable to cope, she temporarily placed the boys in foster care and then, when Mulgrew was four, in an orphanage.</p> <p>It was here, thanks to repeatedly being locked in a garage as a punishment, that Mulgrew acquired his crippling fear of the dark. (Happily, he was to find that in his 80-man \"cell\" \u2013 more like a warehouse \u2013 in the Texas prison, the lights were never switched off.) They returned after two years to live with their mother in a Glasgow tenement; he heard nothing from his father until he was 11.</p> <p>His brother went back to the home once, he says, and found a report that had been written&#xa0;of their time there. \"It was heartbreaking. It was terrible. I had once given somebody something, a cross or something, to 'be my best friend'. They&#xa0;said I\u2026 They describe me as a&#xa0;'needy child'.&#xa0;I'm kind of pissed off about that, because why wouldn't you be, for fuck's sake. Of&#xa0;course I&#xa0;was needy.</p> <p>\"And when I read that, it was terrible, I thought, fuck, that's me, I've lived my whole life like that. That was\u2026 that was bad. Er\u2026\" He&#xa0;coughs. \"That was when I was four, I think. And then, that's it. That's me, end of story.\"</p> <p>He carried that eagerness to please through his childhood, he says, and through Strathclyde University, where he studied business. Before he graduated, he'd already secured a&#xa0;job interview at&#xa0;NatWest.</p> <p>He found he was good at it, he says, and was fast-tracked by supportive bosses. \"And I'm appalled to say I had read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_and_Abel_(novel)\" title=\"\">Kane And Abel</a> and really liked that kind of banker thing. I was quite proud of it.\" His people-pleasing tendencies may&#xa0;even be part of what made him so successful, he thinks.</p> <p>He now says he was not the only one desperate to make an impression. \"You sit in meetings and everyone is talking about mathematical stuff and 'the probability of default is zero point such-and-such based on this and this' and you're sitting looking at everyone else and thinking, do you understand this?</p> <p>\"Now to say, 'Hold on a minute, I'm really sorry, I don't understand this. Can you explain this to me?' That is just incredibly difficult to do. People just sat there and everybody was too frightened to ask.\"</p> <p>How much did he earn? He gets up and puts a&#xa0;log on the fire. \"Do you really want to know that? Well, I got paid more in a year than I made in that deal [the one that landed him in prison]. I got paid a phenomenal amount of money. And I'll tell you something, I never asked for it. I was amazed when I got it, and what it meant for me was\u2026 Me! Me. Look at&#xa0;me. I've made it in this business, I&#xa0;can't bloody believe it.\" He's been described by former colleagues as arrogant, I say. \"I think I had moments of extreme arrogance.\"</p> <p>GNW's most important relationship was with Enron, whose team hosted the wildest and most lavish business trips, and had millions at their fingertips to invest through their bankers. The company, Mulgrew now says, \"was the epitome of the capitalist model. When you went into their buildings in London or Houston, they had the share price everywhere, even in the elevators. And everybody, from the secretaries and janitors up to the big guy, got paid in shares\u2026 So almost all of them are sitting there with their own mental calculation, all the time, of how much wealthier they had got.\"</p> <p>He admits he was \"dazzled\" by it, and particularly by Fastow. \"He's the CFO of America's hotshot company, he's 36 years of age, an Ivy League guy. He has all those nice things in life: nice teeth, nice hair, shakes your hand properly. So when he offered me the investment, if he'd asked me to invest in a pizza parlour with him, I&#xa0;would have done it.\"</p> <p>\"The investment\", needless to say, is the most tangled part of Mulgrew's story. \"Are you going to ask me about innocence and guilt, all that?\" he asks abruptly early in our interview. The three men had insisted on their innocence of the fraud while fighting extradition; their&#xa0;later plea bargain was taken by some as proof of their venality. So, is&#xa0;he guilty?</p> <p>He answers with a question. \"Do&#xa0;you like football? Well, Kenny Dalglish, first time he was a&#xa0;manager, was asked after a game that ended 1-1 and he got a dubious penalty, and the guy said to him, 'Was it a penalty?' and he said, 'Of&#xa0;course it was. The ref gave it, so&#xa0;it was a penalty.' In law, it's a fact that I'm guilty. I am guilty. Definitely, I&#xa0;have to be. I went to jail.\"</p> <p>It was the turn of the millennium, and NatWest was fighting two hostile takeover bids that put in doubt the future of its hotshot investment banking division. Mulgrew, as GNW's leader, was talking secretly with a number of other banks about taking over his team wholesale. In the midst of this turmoil, he says, \"Fastow said to me, 'If you do leave, do you want to do this deal?'\"</p> <p>The deal involved the three men recommending to NatWest that it sell a stake it owned in an offshore investment vehicle called Swap Sub for $1m, without informing their employers who was buying it \u2013 in fact, a company controlled by Giles Darby. The three had put up $250,000 of their own money for the purchase.</p> <p>Fastow, meanwhile, had persuaded Enron to buy the stake for $20m. When the deal went through, he and a colleague pocketed $12.3m between them, while the three Britons shared $7.35m. (In 2002, Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to repay $23.8m in stolen money, after turning informant against his former Enron colleagues.)</p> <p>The US indictment on which the men were extradited stated that the men knew NatWest's Swap Sub stake was worth vastly more than they sold it for, and had conspired with Fastow to defraud Enron, at one point flying to Houston to present a seminar on how it should be conducted. \"The concept of saying, 'Right, we're going to do a presentation on how do to a fraud,' it's fucking ridiculous,\" Mulgrew says. He also disputes vigorously that he undersold the Swap Sub stake. The US quickly dropped the conspiracy line of inquiry after Fastow insisted he had acted alone.</p> <p>But the three accepted, as laid out in a&#xa0;\"statement of facts\" negotiated tortuously between prosecutors and the men's lawyers, that they were guilty of breaching NatWest's internal compliance rules that required they inform their employers of the deal \u2013 the basis of Mulgrew's assertion that he just breached his contract \u2013 and a \"theft of opportunity\" against NatWest, depriving the bank of the opportunity to make the money that they had pocketed. \"My lawyer took me out for coffee the day we were doing the statement of facts, to explain why I&#xa0;was signing it. And he assures me that that is known as a theft of opportunity. Did I deliberately defraud NatWest? Absolutely not.\"</p> <p>They took the plea bargain rather than fighting the case, he says, because every (London-based) witness they wanted to call to back up their story, now represented by NatWest's lawyers, refused to travel to testify, and losing held out a prospect of at least 20 years in prison.</p> <p>Guilt, though, is a mischievous thing. In the book, Mulgrew describes facing his first shift cleaning the prison toilets and experiencing \"an overpowering sense that I'd been found out, and placed where I really belonged. Maybe I deserved this prison after all. Maybe I deserved a&#xa0;lot worse. I'd climbed the ladder of success only to realise I'd perched my ladder against the wrong wall.\"</p> <p>Does he mean he took a wrong moral turn? \"There's a lot of that. Should we have seen Fastow for what he was becoming? Should we have known better? You look at some transactions\u2026 and you think, hmm, maybe we should have blown the whistle there and we didn't. I&#xa0;have a lot regrets about that. I have a&#xa0;lot&#xa0;of regrets about not\u2026 being strong enough as a person.\"</p> <p>Two months after they had done the deal with Fastow, Mugrew says, he saw him in Miami. \"Of course, I&#xa0;was fascinated about how he had made so much money [on the Swap Sub deal]. And, of course, I never asked him. I thought about asking him, but instead I decided to act like I did that every Tuesday, that I was cool. And when I look at that now I just\u2026 I think I was a horse's arse. Those are&#xa0;the kind of bits where I think I&#xa0;must have been polluted by it. All I&#xa0;did was thank him. 'Thanks very much, that was great. Maybe we'll do some more in the future.' I just stood there like a big diddy. And that's dreadful, I think.\"</p> <p>The consolation to his critics, he notes wryly, is that he has \"lost it all\". He spent millions on legal fees, he says, and still has debts to settle. As well as the share in the bar and \"some other ones\", all he owns is a small building company in Lewes. His priorities, though, are rebuilding his relationship with Calum, now 16,&#xa0;and finding Cara Katrina, the imagined horrors of whose absence, for someone who was abandoned by&#xa0;his own father and still lives with the legacy of childhood terrors, is, he says, a \"designer nightmare\".</p> <p>After Calum was born, he didn't speak to his own father for three years, he volunteers at one point (the pair had forged a relationship of sorts as he grew into adulthood), unable to deal with the enormity of what that abandonment meant. Eventually his father, who has since died, wrote Mulgrew a letter, having seen an article about him in the City press, that read: \"Congratulations. Looks like you've finally beaten me.\"</p> <p>\"So I phoned him, went for a drink, and eventually I said to him, 'What did you mean by that letter?' He said, 'Well, you've always been driven by me. You've always wanted to beat me.'\"</p> <p>That's an extraordinary thing to say to the son you abandoned until he was 11, I say.</p> <p>\"I think so,\" Mulgrew says. \"But that was him. I&#xa0;said, 'I didn't speak to you because I had a son, and I&#xa0;couldn't believe that you had fucked off and not been there. I can't understand that. I would never leave my kids.'\" He stops suddenly. \"That would be a good ending to a movie, wouldn't it? As I left them to&#xa0;go to prison. And everything that has gone wrong since.\" <strong> </strong></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece is on the verge of a breakthrough in talks with its creditors that could wipe out up to 70% of its debts and alleviate the crisis in the eurozone. An outline deal, hurriedly endorsed by Brussels, came after a frantic three days of negotiations that at one time appeared to be heading for deadlock. It appeared that Greece had secured a deal to pay an interest rate of 3.1%, rising to 4.75%, on new 30-year bonds created from its outstanding \u20ac360bn (\u00a3300bn) debt burden. The effect would be for creditors to accept writedowns of up to 70% on many of their loans. Sources close to the Greek government said it was still possible that major lenders could walk away if there was a failure to get agreement on some of the fine detail, but Athens was confident that further talks over the weekend would bring a comprehensive deal. Before the news, trading on world stock markets was subdued, indicating the importance attached to a Greek deal as investors waited for the outcome before committing funds. The FTSE 100 finished the day down 12 points at 5728.55, closing before speculation surfaced that a Greek deal was imminent. The French CAC and the German Dax were also down 7 and 11 points respectively. The Dow Jones followed a more positive path closing up 96.5 points at 12720.48. Greece has become the focus of tension in the eurozone for the third time in as many years after first announcing it was in trouble in the spring of 2010. It was bailed out along with Ireland and Portugal, then in May last year it became clear that the \u20ac110bn Athens had received would be insufficient to finance its growing debts and that a second bailout was necessary. German resistance to giving any more financial support without a sacrifice by creditors of at least 50% of their loans has held up attempts by Brussels to co-ordinate a second bailout. Greece's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, has spent the last two weeks locked in discussions with a team representing the banks, insurers and hedge funds that hold Greek debt. It is understood a framework deal is in place outlining the basic structure of a bond swap that Venizelos wants to present at the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on Monday. He needs a deal in place, and approval for a second bailout plan, before a \u20ac14.5bn loan refinancing in March. \"The atmosphere of the talks is good, they are continuing today and we hope they will be concluded very soon,\" a government spokesman said. \"This is very important for the sustainability of the national debt and our ability to handle the debt.\" European Union ministers will be meeting in Brussels to reach agreement on a new pact enforcing stricter budget controls in the eurozone that could allow the single currency area's highest court to fine countries that fail to adopt key rules. The European Central Bank wrecked an earlier draft of the agreement after warning that the enforcement powers it proposed were weak and would fail to keep errant countries in line. Under the guidance of Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, Brussels has drafted a tighter pact that would allow the courts to punish a country that refuses to implement a balanced budget rule in its national law with a penalty of up to 0.1% of GDP. Every EU country except Britain is expected to sign off on the pact when leaders meet at a summit on 30 January. The debt talks in Greece were expected to continue into Friday evening to thrash out the fine print of the deal. Even if a decisive agreement were to be reached, the proposals will have to be put to the technocrats and they would be likely to change it again. But the prospect of a deal seemed to encourage investors to move away from safe havens in favour of riskier assets for the first time in several months. US bond prices slipped and German bonds followed suit, both on hopes for a deal and on more upbeat news from the US housing market. Kevin Flanagan, chief fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said the drop in demand for US bonds, and therefore decrease in the price, \"seems due to a combination of developments beginning with yesterday's US jobless claims figures (which showed a sharp drop in the newly jobless) and reports that the Greek negotiations with private sector investors may yield results after all.\" Benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 2.01% from 1.97% late on Thursday. The rise in the yield, which follows a decline in the price, were in line with a decline in German bunds, another safe-haven asset. \"Europe is calmer. Their auctions have gone OK, and the euro has responded,\" said David Ader, head government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group. But he added that the \"myopic focus\" on rumours about Greece underscored the market's general lack of confidence. Earlier, France's president Nicolas Sarkozy, warned that Europe remained at risk and urged Greece's political leaders not to delay important decisions to stabilise their debt-ridden economy. \"The eurozone remains in danger. The whole of Greece's political class must understand that it cannot put off decisions needed to resolve the country's crisis,\" he told a meeting with ambassadors.",

The festive performance was helped by the company calling a temporary halt to site improvements, and opening up delivery slots which it had expected to be hit by snow.</p> <p>With renewed speculation of possible bid interest from Morrisons or Marks and Spencer, the shares jumped 7.55p to 87.65p yesterday in reasonable volume. One chunk of 265,000 shares changed hands at 95p each. But City analysts are sceptical about takeover tales, with Clive Black at Shore Capital saying recently:</p> <blockquote> The appetite for outsiders to bid for a problem and complex facility distributing for Waitrose is not clear to us. <br> </blockquote> <p>More fundamentally the company is due to report full year figures at the end of the month.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 12.60 points lower yesterday at 5728.55p. But the leading index still improved by 92 points during a week which saw growing hopes of a resolution to the eurozone crisis. Investors took Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of nine eurozone countries, as well the European Financial Stability Fund, in their stride.

      "bodyText": "Ocado shares have been steadily recovering from recent lows after the online grocer reported better than expected Christmas trading, and yesterday they moved higher still on the back of vague takeover talk. The company, whose main supplier Waitrose is increasing rolling out a rival delivery service, fell to around 52p last year following problems with its warehouse and distribution system and amid fears of growing competition. The festive performance was helped by the company calling a temporary halt to site improvements, and opening up delivery slots which it had expected to be hit by snow. With renewed speculation of possible bid interest from Morrisons or Marks and Spencer, the shares jumped 7.55p to 87.65p yesterday in reasonable volume. One chunk of 265,000 shares changed hands at 95p each. But City analysts are sceptical about takeover tales, with Clive Black at Shore Capital saying recently: The appetite for outsiders to bid for a problem and complex facility distributing for Waitrose is not clear to us. More fundamentally the company is due to report full year figures at the end of the month. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 12.60 points lower yesterday at 5728.55p. But the leading index still improved by 92 points during a week which saw growing hopes of a resolution to the eurozone crisis. Investors took Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of nine eurozone countries, as well the European Financial Stability Fund, in their stride.

      "bodyText": "Crisis-hit Athens has turned to the glory that was Greece to help its ruined economy. The debt-choked nation has taken the dramatic step of deciding to exploit some of its past majesty by utilising the Acropolis and other antiquities \u2013 cultural gems until now considered too sacred to besmirch with commerce. Under a scheme revealed this week, foreign film crews, advertising agencies and other commercial enterprises will be allowed to photograph 5th century BC Periclean masterpieces such as the Parthenon, in the hope that it will help boost the country's coffers and image abroad. Archaeological treasures including the temple of Delphi, the most popular site after the Acropolis, will be available as backdrops for filming and photographic shoots for as little as \u20ac1,600 (\u00a31,339) a day. But acutely aware of the sensitivity surrounding the move, officials cautioned that the opening of sites would still be strictly controlled. Following uproar in the Greek media, the culture minister himself, Pavlos Geroulanos, tweeted that any suggestions the relics would be \"rented out\" were simply \"untrue\". No company or individual would be given \"exclusive rights\" to them, officials said. The move follows intense pressure from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, the foreign lenders keeping the nation afloat. With fears of Greece defaulting on its debt mounting by the day, EU officials stepped in saying the time had come for its cultural treasures to be put to work. Culture ministry officials agreed to legislation facilitating access to sites by lowering the costs of permits. Policymakers both in and outside Greece have long contended that the country's classical masterpieces have been under-utilised despite being \"the greatest brand name on earth\". \"It will be to our benefit if what we have to show is shown,\" said former finance minister Stefanos Manos. Previously the country's central council of archaeology, one of the nation's most powerful bodies, had steadfastly refused to grant access to the treasures for anything other than scientific research. Filming requests were rebuffed or granted only for an astronomical fee. With professional photographers unable to access sites, international book publishers had stopped printing contemporary pictures. In its 2,500-year history the Acropolis has only ever been rented out for filming to Francis Ford Coppola and to Nia Vardalos, the Greek-Canadian star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, for her sequel My Life in Ruins. At the time Vardalos complained that she had spent \"an awful lot of energy and time\" trying to convince Greece that the move would be to its benefit. Forced to survive on a mere 0.7% of the national budget, the culture ministry hopes the fees will help boost its ability to look after monuments that have been badly hit by Greece's economic crisis. Lack of maintenance funds have meant that workers could only start building a new staircase in Delphi this week. All the revenues will be used by the ministry, whose funds have been cut by more than 30% since 2010. \"This is a very big step and we are not going to stand idly by if we feel the monuments are being used improperly,\" said one archaeologist. She said many of her colleagues were \"not happy\".",

There are a number of other important territories that also tax capital gains made by foreign investors on disposals of shares in companies in their territory (notably China). Foreign investors in such territories can breathe a little easier as a result.\" Foreign investors have been pulling out of India as the country continues to struggle with inflation and a series of high profile corruption scandals \u2013 in one of the biggest a former minister has been charged with taking millions in bribes during the sale of 2G mobile phone spectrum. Using a subsidiary registered in the Netherlands, Vodafone bought 67% of Hutchison Essar from the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, via a company registered in the Cayman Islands, in 2007. The Indian government argued Vodafone should have held back from Whampoa a sum equivalent to the capital gains tax due on the deal. Vodafone is buying out its remaining partner in the business, Essar Group, having agreed to pay \u00a33.2bn for the Indian firm's 33% stake in the joint venture. India's economic growth has been revised down to 7.2% this year, from previous estimates of 9%, and lower than the 8.5% expansion in 2010-11.",

The deal is believed to include Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers, Sony Music, Universal Pictures and Disney. It is not thought to include games console suppliers, leading to immediate speculation that HMV may choose to refocus its product mix, expanding film and music and down-playing games. Shops are also expected to accelerate plans to resurrect vinyl offers. HMV's commitment to generate a third of sales from technology lines such as headphones and iPads is likely to remain. The deal with suppliers was accompanied by a relaxation of HMV's banking covenants. Loan terms were last relaxed only seven months ago, when HMV was forced to seek new emergency facilities from its lenders, led by state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Under the punishing terms of previous loan agreements, chief executive Simon Fox had admitted HMV was some way from being able to tell shareholders it had a \"full, credible equity story\". Asked if he could now tell investors that the group did have a story to tell, he said: \"I don't thing we can quite say that. [But] this clearly represents a material improvement in our financial position.\" Fox believes net debt will reach something between \u00a3175m and \u00a3180m by the end of April, but \u2014 based on current trading patterns \u2014 can be halved within three years. This target excludes any proceeds from the likely disposal of the group's Live business, which is expected to raise about \u00a360m. David Joseph, executive chairman of Universal Music UK said: \"HMV is a vital part of the UK music industry and we are delighted that the support of the film studios and music companies is helping to secure its future. We look forward to working closely with HMV in the years ahead.\"",
