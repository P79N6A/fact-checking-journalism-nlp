      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, is preparing to hand out multimillion-pound share awards to 1,000 of its top staff as it attempts to bypass the new European Union rules capping bankers' bonuses. HSBC, which has previously admitted it was considering salary rises across the board to tackle the limit on bonuses, has been discussing with its key investors ways of making quarterly payments of shares to keep up the level of its top bankers' pay. The cap, which came into force on 1 January, bars banks from paying bonuses worth more than individuals' salaries, unless shareholders approve the payments, in which case they can be only twice the size of the salaries. The rule is opposed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who is taking legal action against it, and by the Bank of England, which has warned it would push up the costs of running banks. HSBC's chairman, Douglas Flint, said last year he was confident that the bank's shareholders would back any schemes that kept the bank competitive. Its staff will be subject to the bonus cap wherever they work in the world, while employees of US and Asian banks will only fall under the restrictions if employed in the EU. HSBC, which would not comment, is proposing that the top bankers who receive the extra awards of shares will be required to retain them for five years after selling some to meet their tax obligations. The plans to tackle the bonus cap are the latest to be exposed at a time when major banks across the City are preparing to award bonuses for 2013 \u2013 not affected by the limitations \u2013 starting with the US banks such as Goldman Sachs next week. Barclays is preparing to hand monthly allowances to its staff \u2013 probably in shares rather then the initial proposal of cash. Other banks may yet attempt to opt for salary rises.

    "webTitle": "JP Morgan Chase to pay more than $2bn in penalties for Madoff ties", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JP Morgan has agreed to pay a record $2bn to settle charges that it knowingly ignored evidence that convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme was \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d The settlements, announced Tuesday, included a so-called deferred prosecution agreement that requires the bank to acknowledge its failures but also allows it to avoid criminal charges provided reforms are enacted at the bank within two years. No individual executives were accused of wrongdoing. The US attorney's office for the southern district of New York said the bank it had lodged two charges against JP Morgan for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in connection with Madoff\u2019s con. The act requires banks to file suspicious activity reports when they \"detect certain known or suspected violations of federal law or suspicious transactions\". To settle those charges, JP Morgan has agreed to pay $1.7bn. The penalty, which is subject to court approval, is the \"largest ever bank forfeiture and largest ever [Department of Justice] penalty for a Bank Secrecy Act violation,\" according to the attorney\u2019s office. JP Morgan will pay another $350m to settle with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over related issues. Shares of JP Morgan were down 1.3% at $58.26 in afternoon trading. Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, said JP Morgan held suspicions about Madoff as early as 1998 but continued to take his business. One fund manager warned the bank in December 1998 that Madoff\u2019s returns were \u201cpossibly too good to be true\u201d and raised \u201ctoo many red flags\u201d to invest. \u201cJP Morgan as an institution failed, and failed miserably,\u201d said Bharara at a New York press conference. There were \u201clots of failures by lots of people outside the bank,\u201d said Bharara but the bank allowed Madoff to operate for years despite its own concerns about his operations. \u201cThe bank connected the dots when it came to its own profits but was not so diligent when it came to its legal obligations,\u201d said Bharara. Bharara said the bank had plenty of reasons to be suspicious of Madoff. \u201cThe sheer volume and use of the funds in Madoff,\u201d should have alerted the bank, said Bharara. Some $150bn went in and out of the account between 1998 and 2008 and none of it was used to buy securities, which was ostensibly Madoff\u2019s business, said Bharara. \u201cWhen it came to its own money JP Morgan knew how to connect the dots and protect itself against risk,\u201d said Bharara. In 2007 there were grave concerns within the bank that Madoff was a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d. The bank redeemed $275m of its own money from Madoff funds between October 2008 and December 2008. After Madoff\u2019s arrest on December 11 2008 a supervisor at the bank wrote to a JP Morgan analyst: \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the analyst. Madoff was arrested at his Manhattan penthouse five years ago last month after his $20bn scam came to light. He is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence. JP Morgan was his bank for two decades and the US authorities charge that the bank continued to service his business even though staff suspected something was wrong. The fraudster himself predicted the bank would one day face a big fine over their relationship. In a 2011 interview with the Financial Times he said: \u201cJPMorgan doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell of not coming up with a big settlement.\u201d He claimed: \u201cThere were people at the bank who knew what was going on.\u201d The payment brings the total of fines imposed on JP Morgan to nearly $20bn in the past year. The bank has also been fined for its mortgage bond sales and still faces an investigation into its hiring of the children of Chinese officials, a move allegedly made to drum up business. JP Morgan will have to make quarterly reports to the US authorities for the next two years in order to prove it is in compliance with the BSA and anti-money laundering legislation. The bank has agreed not to write off the $1.7bn penalty against tax. The money will go to victims of Madoff's fraudulent activities. US authorities believe that Madoff Securities operated as a Ponzi scheme for more than three decades. While Madoff claimed to have technical formula that allowed him to produce outsized returns, he was in fact paying people with money taken from new clients in a giant pyramid scheme. At the time of its collapse in December 2008 Madoff Securities claimed to have assets of more than $65bn. In fact its assets were worth around $300m. The US authorities claim JP Morgan bankers were aware that Madoff was running a scam, one that was run almost exclusively through the bank. This arrangement continued even as the bank\u2019s own analysts were worried that Madoff was a fraudster. In October 2008, a derivative analyst wrote a memo in which he questioned Madoff\u2019s alleged investment strategy. The memo questioned Madoff\u2019s \u201codd choice\u201d of a small, unknown accounting firm to audit his books and that the bank seemed to be relying on \u201cMadoff\u2019s integrity\u201d with little to validate that decision. \u201cThere are various elements in the story that could make us nervous,\u201d the memo stated, including an \u201capparent fear of Madoff, where no one dares ask any serious questions as long as the performance is good.\u201d According to court papers filed by Irving Picard, the trustee charged with recouping losses for Madoff\u2019s victims, another JP Morgan banker claimed Madoff\u2019s \u201cOz-like signals\u201d were difficult to ignore some 18 months before the scheme collapsed. Picard\u2019s filings also quote a June 2007 email from a senior JP Morgan banker warning colleagues that another banker \u201cjust told me that there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme.\u201d In late October 2008 the bank alerted the UK\u2019s serious organised crime agency that Madoff\u2019s returns were \u201ctoo good to be true \u2013 meaning that it probably is.\u201d However it did not file a suspicious activity report with the US authorities. The attorney general\u2019s agreement states that JP Morgan \u201cwilfully\u201d failed to report Madoff\u2019s suspicious activity and that its own internal compliance systems were inadequate. JP Morgan has always denied wrongdoing in the case. In a statement the bank said it \u201ccould have done a better job pulling together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff from different parts of the bank over time.\u201d But the bank added that it did not believe any JP Morgan employee had knowingly assisted Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme. \u201cMadoff\u2019s scheme was an unprecedented and widespread fraud that deceived thousands, including us, and caused many people to suffer substantial losses,\u201d said the bank. John Coffee, Columbia law professor, said: \u201cJP Morgan worked with Madoff for 20-odd years. It appears they didn't want to look too closely at a large and presumably profitable client.\u201d That said Coffee said JP Morgan was not the only organisation that failed to stop Madoff. \u201cThe securities and exchange commission failed to spot him too,\u201d said Coffee. JP Morgan's deep pockets $2bn paid on Tuesday for failing to alert US authorities about Madoff Ponzi scheme, despite suspicions. $13bn paid in November to settle charges that it routinely bundled bad home loans into securities sold as high-quality to investors. $4.5bn in November to settle allegations it mis-sold mortgage bonds to pension funds and other investors. $920m paid in September to settle US investigations into the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading scandal. $470m paid in September in ($390m refunds and $80m in settlement) for billing customers for identity theft protection they did not receive. $410m paid in July in penalties and repayments for alleged manipulation of California and midwest electricity markets. $100m paid in March to former customers of collapsed investment firm MF Global. $850m (approximately) paid in January for robosigning \u2013 automatic home repossessions. $6.4bn \u2013 the total of nine separate fines paid in 2011 and 2012. Total fines in the past three years = $28.7bn",

      "bodyText": "Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire who made hundreds of millions engineering the sale of a 45% stake in Boots to US retailer Walgreen, will face a potential investor rebellion over concerns he could have \"undue influence\" over the company. Leading US investor CtW Investment Group has called on shareholders to back its proposals to limit Pessina's influence on the company. Pessina, executive chairman of Boots owner Alliance Boots, controls 8% of Walgreen's shares and has a seat on the board. His stake will increase to 16% if Walgreen buys the rest of Boots, which it has the option to buy for $9.5bn by 2016. In a letter to investors, CtW said: \"The sudden concentration of ownership in a single individual marks a significant shift in Walgreen's governance structure, raising questions about whether Pessina could have undue influence. \"Walgreen has embarked on a dramatic and potentially risky transformation of its strategy, board and ownership structure, placing a high premium on the additional protections proxy access affords shareholders.\" CtW, which represents union-sponsored pension funds that have $250bn of assets under management and are major investors in Walgreen, is calling for a change in the US company's governance rules to allow shareholders with just a 3% stake to nominate directors to the board. The shareholder body, which owns 0.5% of Walgreen's publicly floated shares, said its proposals would safeguard against \"potential abuse by special interests and short-term activists\" and allow long-term small investors to act in the event of \"costly transactional failure or other material governance failure\". Michael Pryce-Jones, senior governance policy analyst at CtW, said several big pension funds, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), had already said they will vote in favour of the motion at Walgreen's annual meeting in Chicago on Wednesday. He said there was a \"very good chance\" that the proposal will get voted through. \"We are concerned that he [Pessina] could have undue influence, and where will accountability come from.\" Shareholder advisory groups ISS and PIRC have encouraged shareholders to back the proposal. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 9 January 2014.

      "bodyText": "Hindsight is a regulator's worst enemy. Even so, Clive Adamson, the regulator who approved the Rev Paul Flowers as chairman of the Co-op Bank in 2010, would have done better on Tuesday to say he made a straightforward mistake. Adamson's plea that the decision was justified given \"the information I had at the time\" was deeply unconvincing. Forget this year's allegations of drug-taking against Flowers. Forget, too, his conviction in 1981 for gross indecency; Flowers volunteered the information at interview with Adamson but, given that the conviction was spent, it was fair to dismiss its relevance. Two separate factors were most definitely relevant in 2010. First, Flowers had no senior banking experience. Given the appalling record in the crisis of banks chaired by non-bankers (Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS) a red flag should have been raised. Second, Adamson opted for a messy arrangement that was bound to cause trouble. He decided that Flowers, despite his lacking of banking expertise, could be approved if two experienced deputy chairmen were on hand. This apparent safeguard was no use to anybody. Rodney Baker-Bates and David Davies do not appear to have been told they were semi-official spies in the cab. Worse, when the two deputies warned about the dangers of Co-op Bank's vainglorious attempt to buy 631 Lloyds branches, nothing happened. Flowers' appointment, in other words, was a muddle. If the Co-op Bank's board was regarded in 2010 as \"unruly\" \u2013 Adamson's description \u2013 the right regulatory response would have been to insist on a slimmer version under an experienced and competent chairman. The calamity at the Co-op \u2013 it needs stating \u2013 had deeper roots than Flowers' elevation to the chairmanship. For a start, the bank's misguided takeover of Britannia building society happened in 2009. It would be quite wrong if Flowers is made the fall guy. But Adamson's approval of Flowers was still \"a negligent decision, a very poor decision\", as Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, put it. If that judgment is repeated in the committee's final report, Adamson's hold on the post of head of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority will be extremely weak. Centrica's loss Is Nick Luff, Centrica's brain-box numbers man since 2007, quitting to join publisher Reed Elsevier because he's bored or ambitious, or is he merely in search of quieter pastures where Ed Miliband won't threaten to impose price controls? Hard to say, as the man himself did not share his career thinking with either set of shareholders. But he's swapping the finance director's job at a high-profile company worth \u00a317bn for the finance director's same job at a low-profile company worth \u00a319bn. On the face of it, the move does not obviously represent advancement. Luff, it is said, held no ambitions to succeed Sam Laidlaw as Centrica's chief executive. In that regard, his exit is different in character to that of Phil Bentley, boss of British Gas, a year ago. But, from Centrica's point of view, Luff's departure is more troubling. Yes, Reed Elsevier , under chairman Anthony Habgood and chief executive Erik Engstrom, has become a quietly successful international business. And, yes, the seven-year itch is a fact of life in the executive lane. But is hard to believe that Laidlaw had imagined his finance director would be vulnerable to poaching from that direction. Call it a comedown for Centrica and a small recruitment victory for Reed. Retail sales You've got to laugh, writes Larry Elliott. Announcing that prices have been falling in the high street even more quickly than they were during the depths of the slump of 2008-09, the British Retail Consortium said its members were doing their bit to help consumer budgets go a bit further at Christmas. Well, that's one way of looking at it. What really happened was that retailers had too much stock and panicked, slashing prices in the hope of drumming up some business. No retailer willingly takes the axe to profit margins at the busiest time of the year. Consumers were the big winners from the traditional Christmas showdown. But news that a brutal deflation gripped the high street also takes the pressure off Mark Carney at the Bank of England. If the BRC's survey is accurate, inflation will fall below its 2% target in December, removing any immediate pressure for an increase in borrowing costs.",

Announcing that prices have been falling in the high street even more quickly than they were during the depths of the slump of 2008-09, the British Retail Consortium said its members were doing their bit to help consumer budgets go a bit further at Christmas.</p> <p>Well, that's one way of looking at it. What really happened was that retailers had too much stock and panicked, slashing prices in the hope of drumming up some business.</p> <p>No retailer willingly takes the axe to profit margins at the busiest time of the year.</p> <p>Consumers were the big winners from the traditional Christmas showdown. But news that a brutal deflation gripped the high street also takes the pressure off Mark Carney at the Bank of England.</p> <p>If the BRC's survey is accurate, inflation will fall below its 2% target in December, removing any immediate pressure for an increase in borrowing costs.</p>",

The complex finance deals on offer pit dealers against customers on the forecourt, with each one trying to outwit the other to achieve the best deal, usually over three years.</p> <p>If the trend continues, the UK\u2019s workforce will be in a similar position to their counterparts in the US, where to lose your job is not only to put your house at risk but also your car. The rise of the Repo Man (and woman) is upon us.</p> <p>In parts of the continent car buying is suffering a long term fall. France has been badly hit as customers attempt to run their Renaults and Peugeot-Citroen for a little longer.&#xa0;</p> <p>But they scoff when the UK boasts that it has seen a surge in car buying, leaving rival countries to eat dust. The UK car purchase is not a purchase. The car is not owned. When the monthly payments cannot be made, it can be repossessed.</p> <p>Of course, car loans have been a feature of the market for decades. But they demanded a large deposit and the car was owned at the end of the deal. Now customers put down only a fraction of the car price tag and don\u2019t own the car at the end, but must pay off the difference or sign up for a new deal, making the monthly payment a permanent feature of their outgoings, like their mortgage and other direct debits.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cbcf7be4b09f9df01d2652\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-07T10:01:17.303Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer</strong> says today's figures show how UK consumer confidence picked up last year, despite Britain experiencing a prolonged squeeze on income&#xa0;with real wages still falling.</p> <p>Here's his early reaction:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A superb end to 2013 for the auto industry and encouraging news for the economy overall, as car sales jumped 23.8% year-on-year in December. This was a 22nd successive increase and meant that car sales grew by 10.8% overall in 2013 to reach a 5-year high of 2,264,737.</p> <p>&#xa0;Private new car sales rose 19.8% year-on-year in December, and were particularly healthy through 2013 supported by a combination of much improved consumer confidence, rising employment, attractive offers and packages, and motorists\u2019 desire to buy more fuel efficient cars given relatively high petrol prices.</p> <p>Furthermore, there are likely a substantial number of people who have held off for an extended period from replacing their car due to difficult times that have now reached the stage where they really need to act and are more prepared to do so due to the brighter outlook.</p> <p>&#xa0;The strong increase in private car sales in December&#xa0;indicates that demand for cars is holding up well despite consumers\u2019 purchasing power being squeezed by inflation persistently running well above earnings growth.</p> <p>The auto industry will clearly be hoping that UK economic activity holds up well through 2014 and beyond, and that this underpins consumer and business confidence and their willingness to splash out on new cars. The auto industry will also be hoping that the squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power eases over the coming months. Currently, the SMMT expects car sales in 2014 to come in around 2013\u2019s level.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cbcd26e4b09f9df01d2647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-07T09:48:10.601Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/si42/statuses/420482559156695040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/graemewearden\">@graemewearden</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian\">@guardian</a> bah, largely PCP-pumped</p>&mdash; Si C (@si42) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/si42/statuses/420482559156695040\">January 7, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>(<em>PCP =&#xa0;personal contract purchase, where a consumer buys their car on credit</em>)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cbc9eee4b053cde70d0234\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-07T09:46:38.329Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Car sales - early reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCEmmaSimpson/statuses/420488233936355328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>UK car sales have had their best year since &#39;07. 3/4 of sales via finance deals.

Ireland's successful 10 year bond issue, falling German unemployment and rising retail sales, along with a dip in eurozone inflation which was not enough to prevent further ECB stimulus, all helped to push shares and government bonds higher. A smaller than expected US trade deficit was another positive factor. So the final scores read: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 24.77 points or 0.37% higher at 6755.45 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.83% to 9506.20 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.83% (as well) at 4262.68 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.22% higher at 19,468.75 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 2.93% to 10,178.7 Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.64% or 105 points higher. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. And here is the statement from finance minister Michael Noonan on the Irish bond sale, as mentioned by Reuters. Here's more on the successful Irish bond sale, which was three times oversubscribed, courtesy of Reuters: Ireland made a storming return to the international bond market on Tuesday, with bumper demand for the country's first debt sale since exiting its EU/IMF bailout helping to drive down yields across the euro zone's periphery. Investors bid more than \u20ac14bn ($19bn) for the new 10-year bond sold via syndication, nearly four times the size of the final 3.75 billion euro issue, the country's NTMA debt agency said. The bond - the first Dublin has sold since last March - was priced at mid-swaps plus 140 basis points, giving a yield of just over 3.5%, and marked a substantial step towards a target of raising \u20ac6-10bn this year. \"This sale shows that Ireland has fully exited the EU/IMF (bailout),\" Finance minister Michael Noonan said in a statement. \"The yield of 3.54% illustrates the strength of Ireland's international reputation and brings us far closer to the borrowing rates of the strongest European economies.\" Ireland's cost of borrowing over 10 years has tumbled from a peak of about 15%, hit in 2011 as the euro zone's debt crisis intensified. A test of market confidence in Ireland's recovering economy, which grew 1.7% year on year in the three months to September, the sale also sets a benchmark for Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, the eurozone states still under sovereign bailout programmes. \"Such extremely heavy demand reinforces the recent positive sentiment towards Ireland,\" said Ryan McGrath, a Dublin-based bond dealer with Cantor Fitzgerald. \"This bodes well for upcoming issuance by other euro zone peripheral countries.\" Yields on Spain's 10-year benchmark bond fell nearly 10 basis points to 3.81%, while their Greek equivalent fell by 37 basis points. \"The deal has attracted a lot of international interest, and with many of those orders unable to be filled, these investors have had to look elsewhere,\" said Dan Shane, head of SSA syndicate at Morgan Stanley, one of the banks leading the deal. Ireland's 10 year bond issue has raised \u20ac3.75bn at a yield of 3.54%, the country's debt agency has confirmed. It received some \u20ac14bn of bids, marking a strong return to the bond market following the country's exit from its bailout programme. The two Goodyear managers taken hostage by workers at a plant in Amiens in northern France have now reportedly been freed after police intervention. AP reports: The director and human resources chief at the plant in Amiens in northern France walked out of the factory Tuesday afternoon. Minutes earlier, two police officers had entered the facility while a dozen others waited outside. The plant in Amiens, which Goodyear has tried to sell or shutter for five years, has become an emblem of France's labor tensions. The seizure on Monday morning of the two managers appeared to resurrect the once-common practice of \"boss-napping.\" The Goodyear plant's workers, having failed to get guarantees to keep the factory open, are demanding larger severance payments. Breaking news from the US, where the country's biggest bank JP Morgan has agreed a $1.7bn deal with US authorities over violations relating to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Madoff swindled some $20bn from investors and the bank was accused of turning a blind eye to what was the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. The deal includes a two year deferred prosecution agreement with US attorney Preet Bharara.Such an agreement would list all of JP Morgan\u2019s alleged criminal wrongdoings but stop short of an indictment as long as the bank acknowledges wrongdoing and pays the fines. Somf of the funds from the settlement are expected to be used to compensate Madoff's victims. Here is our story from last month which details the background: JP Morgan facing $2bn fine for involvement in Madoff ponzi scheme Despite the fact that the US Federal Reserve announced in December it would trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme by $10bn, investors still try and read the runes whenever a Fed member speaks. And it seems the dovish members of the Fed remain dovish even now the so-called tapering has begun. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a speech in Hartford, Connecticut, that in economic terms \"we remain far from where we need to be\", and that stimulus programmes should be wound down only gradually. The improvement in confidence and demand were positive signs for the 2014 outlook, but Rosengren warned of the damage high unemployment could continue to do, leaving scars on both the labour market and the overall economy. Rosengren - now a non-voting member but the only dissenting voice against tapering last month- said: These long-term labor markets scars, which result from a very slow recovery, lead me to believe that the Federal Reserve should remain highly accommodative and wind down our extraordinary programs only very gradually, in order to minimize the costs and risks of not returning to full employment more quickly. Over in the US, the trade deficit is the smallest for four years, according to figures just released. Exports hit a record high in November and weak oil prices kept imports in check, so the trade gap fell 12.9% to $34.3bn, its smallest deficit since October 2009. Economists had forecast a shortfall of around $40bn. The figures showed that exports to China were the highest on record, while there were also increases in exports to Germany and Japan. And with further growth in demand expected as the European economy continues to recover, the outlook for the US continues to brighten. James Knightley at ING said: This is an encouraging sign for fourth quarter GDP growth \u2013 note that inventory building has been a big GDP growth contributor in recent quarters and this is expected to reverse, but falling imports should offset this to some extent. Some good news for George Osborne amid his battle with other cabinet members over his proposed \u00a312bn of extra welfare cuts. Public confidence in the UK economy is at its highest since 2010, according to a poll by ComRes for ITV News. Apparently, 36% of Britons reckon the economy has improved in the last three months, the highest figure since the question was first asked in October 2010. And 43% expect the economy to improve this year. However only 17% believed their own personal finances had improved in the past quarter. \u2022 Britain's car industry has posted its best sales figures since the financial crisis began, as cheap credit and rising consumer confidence proved a heady cocktail. The SMMT reported that sales jumped by over 10% in 2013 -- as Britain defied the weak European auto market. Details and key charts start here. \u2022 One analysts said the data was \"superb news\" but there is concern that many people are buying their new cars on credit. \u2022 MPs have criticised the City watchdog over the appointment of Paul Flowers to run Co-op bank, as the inquiry into its failed bid for Lloyds branches continued. The FCA's head of supervision defended Flowers appointment...before later admitting that with hindsight it was a mistake. One MP suggested the FCA staff should consider their position. Highlights of the session start here. \u2022 There are signs of renewed confidence in eurozone debt today. Ireland has seen strong demand for a new 10-year bond, while Italy and Spain's borrowing costs have fallen. \u2022 There are new fears that the eurozone is falling into deflation, after the cost of living rose by just 0.8% per year in December. Core inflation rose by the weakest amount on record. \u2022 Angela Merkel has proved that she's still working, a day after it emerged that she'd fractured her pelvis skiing. She took to her crutches for a carol service at the Chancellery. Photos here. And with that, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher. Thanks all. GW Mark Adamson's inquisition is over, with Andrew Tyrie criticising the City watchdog for its role in the Co-op affair. Ireland isn't the only member of the eurozone periphery to enjoy a good day in the bond market. The price of Italian and Spanish sovereign debt has strengthened today, pushing down the interest rates on the bonds. Italian 10-year bonds are now yielding just 3.8%, down from 3.93% last night. Spanish 10-year bonds are now yielding 3.81%, down from 3.91% last night. That's the lowest level since December 2009. In contrast, UK and US 10-year debt is changing hands at around 2.96%. At the peak of the eurozone crisis, Italian 10-year bonds tumbled in value to a point where they were yielding more them 7% -- seen as an unsustainable cost. Those days are behind us.... Success for Ireland in the bond market today, as investors rushed to buy a 10-year Irish sovereign bond -- the first offering since its bailout ended last month. Ireland was looking to raise between \u20ac3bn and \u20ac4bn, and has actually received around \u20ac14bn worth of bids, according to the banks handling the sale. It looks like the bonds will be sold at a yield, or interest rate, of perhaps 3.5%. That's only 0.5% points above UK 10-year borrowing costs. Reuters reports that there was lively demand from traders: Even before initial price thoughts were released for Ireland's sale of the new 10-year bond on Tuesday morning, traders were making prices for brokers in the 'grey market' to satisfy demand from investors who felt they were unlikely to get the allocations they wanted in the debt sale. Lead managers - Barclays, Citi, Danske, Davy, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley - later released initial price thoughts of mid-swaps plus 150bp area, but quickly revised guidance tighter after interest topped EUR9bn, including EUR1.5bn from Ireland's primary dealers. Worth noting that this is a 'syndicated sale' rather than a full-blown auction (ie, Ireland's bankers get to set the size of the sale depending on demand). But still, it shows the growing confidence in Ireland. From Portcullis House, Jill Treanor writes: FCA stands by decision to sanction Paul Flowers as Co-op Bank chairman We've now learned that the City regulators didn't examine Paul Flowers' references before approving him to chair Co-op Bank. While another MP is astounded to learn that Mike Adamson approved Paul Flowers in the time it takes play a football match (without even extra time). Back at parliament, the FCA's head of supervision has conceded that it was a mistake to appoint Paul Flowers to run Co-op Bank. What we really need, of course, is regulators with 20:20 foresight Here's our full news story on Britain's booming car sales, by my colleague Angela Monaghan: UK car sales hit five-year high Here's a flavour: UK car sales soared to their highest level since 2007 last year, fuelled by growing consumer confidence, cheap finance deals and PPI compensation payments. The number of new cars sold jumped 10.8% to 2.26m, the highest level since the financial crisis took hold, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and equivalent to 600 more cars sold a day in 2013 compared with 2012. Prime minister David Cameron highlighted the rise on Twitter as an example of the growing UK economy. \"5 key measures of manufacturing at all-time high &amp; UK car sales top pre-2007 levels. See how we're growing UK economy,\" he tweeted. (scroll back to 9am for the key charts) Back in parliament, Andrea Leadsom MP has suggested that heads should roll at the Financial Conduct Authority over the decision to approve Paul Flowers to chair the Co-op Bank despite his lack of banking experience. The FCA's director of Supervision, Clive Adamson, insisted he was the \"right person\" to oversee Britain's banks. He had told MPs at the start of today's hearing that he stood by the decision to appoint Flowers, and later added that it wouldn't happen today (highlights start here) Rather like a postman braving the British winter, shares in Royal Mail have slipped this morning. They're the third-biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 2% at 560p. As my colleague Nick Fletcher reports, analyst Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald has prompted the sell-off by slapping a Sell recommendation on the newly privatised Royal Mail, with a target price of 500p. Byde warned that Royal Mail faces tough competition in the packets and parcels division, as its core letter deliver business declines. More here: Royal Mail slips as broker says it is time to sell Today's drop means Royal Mail shares are now 8% off their record high. Perhaps the froth, as business secretary Vince Cable put it, is blowing off. Then again, they're still 70% over October's flotation price Proof that it takes more than a fractured pelvis to stop Angela Merkel. Germany's chancellor took to her crutches today to attend the traditional carol service to mark the Christian festival of Epiphany at the Chancellory, with a group of young carol singers in festive costume Merkel attended despite (as we learned yesterday) hurting herself in a cross-country skiing accident in Switzerland over the Christmas holidays. She's had to cancel some meetings, but clearly the business of governing Germany goes on. Patrick Donahue of Bloomberg News reports that the chancellor told the carol singers that she needs to rest after her skiing accident. The Co-op hearing continues... (highlights start here) David Cameron tweets that today's car sales figures show the UK economy is recovering: Andrew Tyrie MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, has told the FCA's Clive Adamson that City watchdogs blundered badly by approving Paul Flowers to chair the Co-op Bank: 07-Jan-2014 10:48 - UK TSC CHAIRMAN TYRIE SAYS DECISION TO APPROVE FLOWERS WAS A 'NEGLIGENT DECISION, A VERY POOR DECISION' The committee is also uncovering fresh details of how Co-op's expansion plans floundered: Clive Adamson is now assuring the Treasury committee that Paul Flowers would not pass today's more rigorous tests to chair a UK bank... ...but doesn't admit that the watchdog blundered by giving the reverend the green light: For background, Flowers' lack of banking know-how was exposed by the committee last autumn (he notoriously couldn't tell MPs what Co-op bank's assets were) . In November he was arrested over a \"drugs supply investigation\". Interesting.... the FCA's Clive Adamson has told MPs that two members of Co-op's bank's board voted against the ill-fated plan to expand by buying hundreds of Lloyds branches: Over in parliament, MPs are grilling Clive Adamson, Director of Supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority, over the fiasco at Co-op Bank. The Treasury Committee are seeking answers over the Co-op's failed bid for hundreds of Lloyds branches (which collapsed as a \u00a31.5bn black hole was uncovered in its books). And in particularly, how City watchdogs allowed the now-disgraced Reverend Paul Flowers to chair the bank. City editor Jill Treanor is there, and tweeting the key points: Reuters is snapping the key points too: UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION ADAMSON SAYS STANDS BY DECISION TO APPROVE CO-OP BANK'S APPOINTMENT OF FLOWERS AS CHAIRMAN UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION ADAMSON SAYS DOESN'T THINK FLOWERS APPOINTMENT WAS A MISTAKE AT THE TIME UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION ADAMSON SAYS VIEW AT TIME OF FLOWERS' APPOINTMENT WAS HE HAD COMPETENCE TO PERFORM THE ROLE UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION ADAMSON SAYS PAUL FLOWERS WAS A \"MUCH MORE COGENT INDIVIDUAL\" IN 2010 UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION SAYS PART OF APPROVED PERSONS REGIME WAS 'BOX-TICKING EXERCISE' UK'S FCA DIRECTOR OF SUPERVISION SAYS DISAPPOINTED NOBODY WHO MAY HAVE KNOWN OF FLOWERS'S MISDEMEANOURS ALERTED REGULATOR FCA ADAMSON SAYS EX-CO-OP BANK CHAIRMAN FLOWERS WAS 'NOT THE SAME INDIVIDUAL' WHEN HE FACED TSC AS HE WAS IN 2010 FCA'S ADAMSON SAYS EX-CO-OP BANK CHAIRMAN FLOWERS WAS 'NOT ON TOP OF TECHNICAL DETAIL' AT TIME OF APPOINTMENT FCA'S ADAMSON SAYS EX-CO-OP BANK CHAIRMAN FLOWERS WAS INTERVIEWED ONLY ONCE BEFORE BEING APPROVED TO TAKE POSITION The session should be streamed live here, but we can't get it to play..... Eurozone inflation has fallen, as the European economy continues to suffer from poor demand, weak growth and a mis-firing banking sector. The cost of living across the eurozone rose by just 0.8% in December, on an annual basis, down from November's 0.9%. That is close to the four-year low of 0.7% recorded in October, and will surely fuel fears that the eurozone is flirting with deflation. Eurostat reported that food, alcohol and tobacco prices were up by 1.8% on an annual basis, while energy prices were unchanged. Non-energy industrial goods prices only crept up by 0.2% over the last year, while services prices were 1% higher. The European Central Bank's mandate is to maintain price stability with inflation below, but close to, 2%. Today's data suggests it is struggling -- something for Mario Draghi and crew to ponder ahead of their monthly meeting on Thursday. Britain's auto industry could be storing up problems for the future by allowing so many consumers to buy new cars on credit. If the economy weakens, people who lose their jobs would struggle to hold onto their cars and their homes. Economics correspondent Phillip Inman warns that we don't know the full scale of the credit boom: There is no information about the average monthly payments made by customers for new cars, the average deposit sizes and the average overhang of unpaid payments when deals expire. The information is important because since 2007 the UK car industry has encouraged cash-strapped customers to forget about the need for a large deposit and adopt a pay-as-you-go attitude. The complex finance deals on offer pit dealers against customers on the forecourt, with each one trying to outwit the other to achieve the best deal, usually over three years. If the trend continues, the UK\u2019s workforce will be in a similar position to their counterparts in the US, where to lose your job is not only to put your house at risk but also your car. The rise of the Repo Man (and woman) is upon us. In parts of the continent car buying is suffering a long term fall. France has been badly hit as customers attempt to run their Renaults and Peugeot-Citroen for a little longer. But they scoff when the UK boasts that it has seen a surge in car buying, leaving rival countries to eat dust. The UK car purchase is not a purchase. The car is not owned. When the monthly payments cannot be made, it can be repossessed. Of course, car loans have been a feature of the market for decades. But they demanded a large deposit and the car was owned at the end of the deal. Now customers put down only a fraction of the car price tag and don\u2019t own the car at the end, but must pay off the difference or sign up for a new deal, making the monthly payment a permanent feature of their outgoings, like their mortgage and other direct debits. IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer says today's figures show how UK consumer confidence picked up last year, despite Britain experiencing a prolonged squeeze on income with real wages still falling. Here's his early reaction: A superb end to 2013 for the auto industry and encouraging news for the economy overall, as car sales jumped 23.8% year-on-year in December. This was a 22nd successive increase and meant that car sales grew by 10.8% overall in 2013 to reach a 5-year high of 2,264,737. Private new car sales rose 19.8% year-on-year in December, and were particularly healthy through 2013 supported by a combination of much improved consumer confidence, rising employment, attractive offers and packages, and motorists\u2019 desire to buy more fuel efficient cars given relatively high petrol prices. Furthermore, there are likely a substantial number of people who have held off for an extended period from replacing their car due to difficult times that have now reached the stage where they really need to act and are more prepared to do so due to the brighter outlook. The strong increase in private car sales in December indicates that demand for cars is holding up well despite consumers\u2019 purchasing power being squeezed by inflation persistently running well above earnings growth. The auto industry will clearly be hoping that UK economic activity holds up well through 2014 and beyond, and that this underpins consumer and business confidence and their willingness to splash out on new cars. The auto industry will also be hoping that the squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power eases over the coming months. Currently, the SMMT expects car sales in 2014 to come in around 2013\u2019s level. (PCP = personal contract purchase, where a consumer buys their car on credit) Skimming the SMMT data, it shows that UK consumers have shifted towards smaller vehicles. Around 35.9% of new cars sold last year were classed as superminis. And demand for green cars also rose, but remains a niche market. Registrations of hybrid and plug-in cars rose 17.5% in 2013 to 32,727 units. There are now 17 models on the market, up from six two years ago, so that could stimulate demand in 2014. The 10.5% jump in car registrations last year brings the UK closer to German as the biggest European car sales market. Spain was the only other Big Five country to see a rise in sale last year. Madrid's government poured millions of euros into a car scrappage scheme, to encourage Spaniards to ditch rusty bangers in favour of shiny new models. While the UK car market rallied last year, sales continued to lag in Europe as the eurozone recession and austerity hit consumers hard: The top three best-selling cars last year were the Ford Fiesta (122k), the Ford Focus (87k) and Vauxhall Corsa (84k). This video from the SMMT has more details: It's official: 2013 was the best year for UK car sales since 2007, as the recovery in consumer spending and affordable credit pushed up demand for new vehicles. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders has just announced that over 2.26 million new cars were sold in 2013, which is a jump of over 10%, and beat its own forecast for the year by around 10,000 new cars. An extra 600 cars were registered each day last year, compared with the darker days of 2012. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, has declared that the UK new car market has helped stimulate the country\u2019s economic recovery, adding: \u201cWhile the European market is only now showing signs of improvement, the UK has consistently outperformed the rest of Europe with 22 consecutive months of growth. The 10.8% increase in 2013 reflects the attractive financial offers available as well as increased demand for more technologically advanced new cars. We expect new car registrations to remain stable in 2014 as customers return to a more regular replacement cycle. As flagged up in our opening post, the figures underline that household spending has picked up in the UK last year. Here's the key points from the SMMT: 2,264,737 cars registered in 2013, up 10.8% on 2012 and exceeding SMMT\u2019s 2.25 million forecast for the year. 2013 hits highest annual registration total since 2007 as December achieves 22nd consecutive monthly rise. On average, an additional 600 extra cars registered per day in 2013 than in the previous year. UK firmly secured as Europe\u2019s second largest car market and only one to grow consistently throughout 2013. 2014 market expected to stabilise with sustainable growth of around 1% over the year. Details and reaction to follow.... Just in: the number of people out of work in Germany fell by 15,000, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to 2.965m in December. No change in the unemployment rate, though, which remains at 6.9% -- compared to a eurozone average of 12.1%. Here's the Reuters newsflashes: 07-Jan-2014 08:55 - GERMAN DEC SEAS. ADJ.

Speaking on BBC News24 a few minutes ago, Longworth welcomed the news that UK car sales rose last year. But he also cautioned that the recovery is not yet based on solid foundations. Some firms, he said, are having to turn down new work because they can't get the finance they need. Longworth said access to finance was the root problem in the UK economy, as: What we really need for great growth is a rebalancing towards exports and increased infrastructure spending in the UK. Another steady, somewhat dull, start to the trading day in Europe, with the major indices little changed. FTSE 100: up 3 points at 6733 German DAX: down 3 points at 9424 French CAC: down 7 points at 4216 Patrick Latchford at Monex Capital Markets says disappointing service sector data from China and the US yesterday have \"dented sentiment, leaving traders generally struggling to find something that's worth cheering\" (despite decent figures from Spain and the UK). Financial stocks are generally higher, pushing the STOXX Europe 600 banking index up 0.3%. Danish shipping giant Moeller Maersk are up 4% after agreeing a deal to sell its stake in Denmark's biggest retailer. We're running a poll, asking if you think we should welcome the rise in UK car sales, or if it's a reason to worry: Booming UK car sales: good news or bad? Just 35 minutes until we get the official details.... Topps Tiles, the UK seller of flooring products (yes, mainly tiles), has reported corking sales figures this morning -- as it profits from the pick-up in the UK housing market. Sales at Topps jumped 9.3% in the last 13 weeks of 2013 (stripping out new stores), which beat City forecasts of a 6% rise. Freddie George, analyst at Cantor, said Topps had enjoyed a \"positive impact of a pick-up in the housing market\", adding: The company plans to open five stores, including three boutique stores, being trialed at Walton and Clapham, geared more to the affluent demographic and sized at c.1000 sq ft. Shares are up 2.3% in early trading. In the City, Centrica's finance director Nick Luff is swapping boardrooms, and becoming the new chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier. It sounds like another small headache for Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, which has faced public and political criticism over price rises recently. Its shares have dipped almost 1% in early trading. Not quite clear when Luff will shift seats. Reed Elsevier says the Oxford maths grad. will join then once a handover has been completed, while Centrica says he could be with them until 31 December 2014. It's not just Brits who are spending more... German retail sales smashed expectations by rising 1.5% in November, data released this morning showed. That more than reverses an 0.8% drop in October, suggesting Europe's largest economy entered the Christmas period in good shape. FastFT has more details. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is concerned that consumers are loading up on credit to buy all these new cars: The Financial Times says last year's booming UK car sales are a sign of rising consumer confidence. It also suggests that people have been using compensation payments from the PPI mis-selling scandal as a downpayment on a new vehicle: Last year\u2019s total is only 6 per cent lower than 2007\u2019s 2.4m sales, and 300,000 cars fewer than the highest-ever total seen in 2003 as the UK continued to outperform European sales, which fell by at least 2 per cent. The rebound in car sales mirrors consumption trends in the UK. As new cars were being driven out of showrooms at almost pre-recession levels, the national accounts show real household spending only 1.5 per cent lower in the third quarter than at the peak. With business investment and exports still in the doldrums, the wider economy remains 2 per cent below the level reached in early 2008. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and the business world. We start with the news that Britain's car sales have, we understand, roared back to their highest level since the financial crisis began. Sales jumped by 10% last year, with over 2.26 million vehicles sold across the country. That's the highest total since 2007. The boom was partly driven by cheap credit, as British consumers flocked to showrooms to treat themselves to a new motor. The data is the latest signal that households have begun spending again, as the UK economy picked up pace last year. It's a stark contrast with the troubled European market, where sales fell through most of 2013 before finally picking up at the end of the year. But it could also be a warning sign -- that the UK's recovery is based on the shifting sands of consumer spending and debt rather than the solid bedrock of exports and investment. The figures are compiled by the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, who will unveil them proudly at 9am GMT. The data is expected to show that over one in seven of the cars bought in the UK last year were made in Britain, which would be an improvement on the situation before the financial crisis. Industry insiders have cautioned, though that UK sales growth will probably slow in 2014. Here's a flavour of Reuters' early take: British car sales have grown strongly in recent years, in a trend that pre-dated last year's rapid economic recovery, and in 2012 Britain overtook France as Europe's second-biggest new car market after Germany. Ford was Britain's top-selling manufacturer for most of 2013, enjoying success with its Fiesta supermini and mid-sized Focus models, followed by General Motors' (GM.N) rival Vauxhall Corsa and Astra. Volkswagen, Nissan and BMW also enjoyed strong sales. We'll find out more at 9am.... Here's today's agenda \u2022 German unemployment figures for December: 8.55am GMT \u2022 SMMT's UK car sales data for 2013: 9am GMT \u2022 Eurozone inflation data: 10am GMT We'll also be tracking reaction to Janet Yellen's confirmation as the next head of the Federal Reserve, at a vote in Washington last night: Senate confirms Janet Yellen as next chair of the Federal Reserve",

      "bodyText": "Do you remember what the future of shopping used to be? In place of a trundle round the high street every few days, we were going to make weekly trips to big-box supermarkets outside town, delight in the bright produce and the enticing smells and drive home happy, our cars low on their axles. Well, there's a new future now: the \"dark store\", the supermarket that we never see at all. Don't be too alarmed by the name, or too excited. Desynchronise your watches. A dark store is just a warehouse full of groceries where staff called \"pickers\" select the goods that have been ordered by an online customer. Sometimes they look almost creepily similar to normal supermarkets. In Hanger Lane, west London, Waitrose operates a dark store in an old John Lewis carpet warehouse. Inside, professional pickers roll baskets around the aisles much like civilians, except they are wrapped up in coats and scarves against the refrigeration system. Elsewhere, they look like nothing you've ever seen. At Tesco's sixth and newest dark store in Erith, south-east London, they operate what is basically a giant robot butler, although they call it a \"goods-to-person pickstation\" and a \"dotcom centre\" (the supermarkets themselves aren't keen on the term \"dark store\"). Instead of laying out the groceries in aisles, at Erith they store most of them more efficiently in towers of blue crates. The robot extracts whatever is needed and brings it to the picker, who stands still (until it's time to visit the freezer). \"It's a little bit like I imagine going into a Willy Wonka factory,\" says Jennifer Creevy, deputy editor of Retail Week. \"It looks really whizzy and there's crates moving around. It's really impressive.\" Organising things this way saves space and time, and creates a safer workplace, according to Dematic, the company that built Tesco's robots. \"With its ergonomic design, you get 100% golden zone single-level picking,\" they say. And who are we to argue? No one knows how much of our grocery shopping will eventually be done online, but everyone agrees it will be a lot more than now. In 2013, the proportion was about 5.5%. This year it should be around 6%. Within five years the value of the market is expected to double in size. Much of the current online demand is met by simply sending pickers around conventional supermarkets, although as demand rises that becomes less efficient, in part because the physically present customers keep getting in the way. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose all have plans to open new dark stores over the coming year or two. \"It just makes sense,\" Creevy says. \"Online is just showing huge, huge growth. Online and convenience stores.\" So in future, when people are doing all their boring and heavy shopping through dark stores, and all their interesting and urgent shopping through convenience stores and local shops, what is going to become of the big boxes? Tesco has already turned one in Watford into something more like a shopping mall, with a cafe, a clothes shop, a restaurant and even a community centre. It's hard to imagine that strategy always working, however, since shopping malls already exist. And that may be no bad thing. Perhaps in 20 years you'll be out in the countryside and you'll be able to say to your bored grandchildren: \"I remember when all this was car parks.\"",

Sometimes they look almost creepily similar to normal supermarkets. In Hanger Lane, west London, Waitrose operates a dark store in an old John Lewis carpet warehouse. Inside, professional pickers roll baskets around the aisles much like civilians, except they are wrapped up in coats and scarves against the refrigeration system.</p> <p>Elsewhere, they look like nothing you've ever seen. At Tesco's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QONyKR0KdYs\" title=\"\">sixth and newest dark store in Erith, south-east London</a>, they operate what is basically a giant robot butler, although they call it a \"goods-to-person pickstation\" and a \"dotcom centre\" (the supermarkets themselves aren't keen on the term \"dark store\"). Instead of laying out the groceries in aisles, at Erith they store most of them more efficiently in towers of blue crates. The robot extracts whatever is needed and brings it to the picker, who stands still (until it's time to visit the freezer).</p> <p>\"It's a little bit like I imagine going into a Willy Wonka factory,\" says Jennifer Creevy, deputy editor of Retail Week. \"It looks really whizzy and there's crates moving around. It's really impressive.\" Organising things this way saves space and time, and creates a safer workplace, according to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTyOh1nlbA#t=53\" title=\"\">Dematic</a>, the company that built Tesco's robots. \"With its ergonomic design, you get 100% golden zone single-level picking,\" they say. And who are we to argue?</p> <p>No one knows how much of our grocery shopping will eventually be done online, but everyone agrees it will be a lot more than now. In 2013, the proportion was about 5.5%. This year it should be around 6%. Within five years the value of the market is expected to double in size. Much of the current online demand is met by simply sending pickers around conventional supermarkets, although as demand rises that becomes less efficient, in part because the physically present customers keep getting in the way. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/06/supermarkets-open-dark-stores-online-food-shopping-expands\" title=\"\">all have plans to open new dark stores over the coming year or two</a>. \"It just makes sense,\" Creevy says. \"Online is just showing huge, huge growth. Online and convenience stores.\"</p> <p>So in future, when people are doing all their boring and heavy shopping through dark stores, and all their interesting and urgent shopping through convenience stores and local shops, what is going to become of the big boxes? Tesco has already turned <a href=\"http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/food/analysis-tesco-watford-the-grocers-vision-for-big-box-retailing-is-exciting-relevant-and-convenient/5051904.article\" title=\"\">one in Watford into something more like a shopping mall</a>, with a cafe, a clothes shop, a restaurant and even a community centre. It's hard to imagine that strategy always working, however, since shopping malls already exist. And that may be no bad thing. Perhaps in 20 years you'll be out in the countryside and you'll be able to say to your bored grandchildren: \"I remember when all this was car parks.\"</p>",

    "webTitle": "FCA stands by decision to sanction Paul Flowers as Co-op Bank chairman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The regulator who authorised Paul Flowers's appointment as chairman of the Co-operative Bank faced intense criticism from MPs on Tuesday after he insisted he stood by the decision to allow the now disgraced Methodist minister to take on the role after a 90-minute interview in 2010. Clive Adamson, head of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), met with incredulity among MPs on the Treasury select committee when he initially refused to concede that the appointment of Flowers \u2013 branded a \"financial illiterate\" by the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie \u2013 had been a mistake. Under often hostile questioning, Adamson was asked if he and others were right to stay at the regulator, which has taken over from the Financial Services Authority. \"You clearly did get it terribly wrong,\" he was told by Andrea Leadsom. The Co-op Bank is now 70% owned by its bondholders, led by US hedge funds, and only 30% by the mutually owned Co-op Group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, after a rescue operation to inject \u00a31.5bn into the bank. The committee is examining the aborted attempt by the Co-op to take over 631 Lloyds Banking Group branches and questioning the merger of the bank with Britannia Building Society in 2009. Tyrie said the regulator's decision to approve Flowers \u2013 who was exposed buying illegal drugs last year \u2013 was \"a negligent decision, a very poor decision\". He said Adamson's evidence exposed flaws in the so-called approved persons regime, under which officials are authorised to work in the City. \"These flaws contributed to the appointment of a man with no knowledge of finance and no experience of running the board of a major corporation as the chairman of Co-op Bank in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis,\" Tyrie said after the hearing. Tyrie called for the entire approved persons regime to be torn up. \"[Adamson] told us that, in the FCA's view, the reforms being applied to banks should also apply across the rest of the financial services industry,\" he said. Towards the end of the two-hour hearing, Adamson eventually conceded that the appointment of Flowers \u2013 who chaired the bank from mid-2010 and left in June 2013, just as the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was identified \u2013 was wrong, but said it had been the right decision at the time. He insisted that the Flowers he authorised was a \"more cogent individual\" than the one who appeared before the committee last year, when the chairman was unable to give the size of the bank's balance sheet. Adamson stressed that nothing in the rules at the time required him to interview Flowers. \"I didn't think it was a mistake given the information I had at the time,\" Adamson said. Flowers, he said, was appointed to chair an \"unruly\" board of 22 individuals, and two deputies were appointed \u2013 Rodney Baker-Bates and David Davies \u2013 to counter his lack of banking knowledge. \"Do I regret what subsequently happened? Yes I do,\" Adamson said, conceding that Flowers would not be authorised now. Mark Garnier MP declared himself \"almost speechless\" after Adamson admitted Flowers had been approved after an hour-and-a-half interview and without his references being taken up. Flowers had disclosed a spent conviction for gross indecency from 1981, but it was not deemed relevant. Sitting in the public area of the committee room was Lord Myners, who was last month appointed as a non-executive of the Co-op Group and will head the review of its governance. As Myners looked on, Adamson said: \"I stand by the decision\" to appoint Flowers. Baker-Bates visited Adamson in 2012 to warn that the takeover of the Lloyds branches was a \"step too far\", but the negotiations were allowed to carry on for another nine months before they collapsed in April 2013. Baker-Bates \"had blown the whistle\", said Labour MP Pat McFadden and, along with the other vice-chairman, Davies, had voted against this so-called Verde transaction. Both have now left the board. Adamson was also facing questions about the Co-op's merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009, which is now blamed for many of the problems at the bank but for which the FSA's authorisation was not officially required. Adamson said there was no political interference, but there had been support for the co-operative movement. The tenure of Graeme Hardie as a non-executive director on the Co-op board was also questioned after he took the role despite having been involved in approving Flowers' position as chairman when he was an adviser to the regulator. Richard Pym, chairman of Co-op Bank, said Hardie was doing a first-rate job and should not resign.",

      "body": "<p>The regulator who authorised Paul Flowers's appointment as chairman of the Co-operative Bank faced intense criticism from MPs on Tuesday after he insisted he stood by the decision to allow the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/17/co-op-bank-former-chairman-cash-drugs\" title=\"\">now disgraced Methodist minister</a> to take on the role after a 90-minute interview in 2010.</p> <p>Clive Adamson, head of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), met with incredulity among MPs on the Treasury select committee when he initially refused to concede that the appointment of Flowers \u2013 branded a \"financial illiterate\" by the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie \u2013 had been a mistake.</p> <p>Under often hostile questioning, Adamson was asked if he and others were right to stay at the regulator, which has taken over from the Financial Services Authority. \"You clearly did get it terribly wrong,\" he was told by Andrea Leadsom.</p> <p>The Co-op Bank is now 70% owned by its bondholders, led by US hedge funds, and only 30% by the mutually owned Co-op Group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, after a rescue operation to inject \u00a31.5bn into the bank. The committee is examining the aborted attempt by the Co-op to take over 631 Lloyds Banking Group branches and questioning the merger of the bank with Britannia Building Society in 2009.</p> <p>Tyrie said the regulator's decision to approve Flowers \u2013 who was exposed buying illegal drugs last year \u2013 was \"a negligent decision, a very poor decision\". He said Adamson's evidence exposed flaws in the so-called approved persons regime, under which officials are authorised to work in the City. \"These flaws contributed to the appointment of a man with no knowledge of finance and no experience of running the board of a major corporation as the chairman of Co-op Bank in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis,\" Tyrie said after the hearing.</p> <p>Tyrie called for the entire approved persons regime to be torn up. \"[Adamson] told us that, in the FCA's view, the reforms being applied to banks should also apply across the rest of the financial services industry,\" he said.</p> <p>Towards the end of the two-hour hearing, Adamson eventually conceded that the appointment of Flowers \u2013 who chaired the bank from mid-2010 and left in June 2013, just as the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was identified \u2013 was wrong, but said it had been the right decision at the time.</p> <p>He insisted that the Flowers he authorised was a \"more cogent individual\" than the one who appeared before the committee last year, when the chairman was unable to give the size of the bank's balance sheet.</p> <p>Adamson stressed that nothing in the rules at the time required him to interview Flowers. \"I didn't think it was a mistake given the information I had at the time,\" Adamson said. Flowers, he said, was appointed to chair an \"unruly\" board of 22 individuals, and two deputies were appointed \u2013 Rodney Baker-Bates and David Davies \u2013 to counter his lack of banking knowledge.</p> <p>\"Do I regret what subsequently happened? Yes I do,\" Adamson said, conceding that Flowers would not be authorised now. Mark Garnier MP declared himself \"almost speechless\" after Adamson admitted Flowers had been approved after an hour-and-a-half interview and without his references being taken up. Flowers had disclosed a spent conviction for gross indecency from 1981, but it was not deemed relevant.</p> <p>Sitting in the public area of the committee room was Lord Myners, who was last month appointed as a non-executive of the Co-op Group and will head the review of its governance. As Myners looked on, Adamson said: \"I stand by the decision\" to appoint Flowers.</p> <p>Baker-Bates visited Adamson in 2012 to warn that the takeover of the Lloyds branches was a \"step too far\", but the negotiations were allowed to carry on for another nine months before they collapsed in April 2013.</p> <p>Baker-Bates \"had blown the whistle\", said Labour MP Pat McFadden and, along with the other vice-chairman, Davies, had voted against this so-called Verde transaction. Both have now left the board.</p> <p>Adamson was also facing questions about the Co-op's merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009, which is now blamed for many of the problems at the bank but for which the FSA's authorisation was not officially required. Adamson said there was no political interference, but there had been support for the co-operative movement.</p> <p>The tenure of Graeme Hardie as a non-executive director on the Co-op board was also questioned after he took the role despite having been involved in approving Flowers' position as chairman when he was an adviser to the regulator. Richard Pym, chairman of Co-op Bank, said Hardie was doing a first-rate job and should not resign.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK car sales soared to their highest level since 2007 last year, fuelled by growing consumer confidence, cheap finance deals and payouts over PPI mis-selling. However, the sales glut brought a warning that secondhand car prices could slump within the next two years as the market is flooded with vehicles. The number of new cars sold jumped nearly 11% to 2.26m in 2013, the highest level since the onset of the financial crisis, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was equivalent to 600 more cars sold a day in 2013 compared with 2012, and bucked the trend across much of Europe where sales have been falling. UK sales rose by almost a quarter to 152,918 in December alone. Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said the car market had been \"a bright spot\" in the UK economy, helped by cheap finance deals which account for around three-quarters of transactions. He said it was difficult to measure the precise impact of Payment Protection Insurance compensation on the car industry, but that average payouts of \u00a33,000 were having an impact: \"It's enough to put a deposit down on a car.\" John Leech, head of automotive at consulting group KPMG, said that while cheap credit had been great for driving sales, it could store up problems for the used-car market \"a year or two from now\". Leech said there was a danger of an oversupply of used cars building up as consumers opt to return their cars at the end of their three-year personal car plan (PCP) deals. \"Car dealers now sell finance with the car where half the price is paid over 36 months and the remaining half is cleared by a bullet payment at the end of the three years. This has been great for new car sales as consumers choose to take a new car on another PCP rather than pay the bullet. The danger for car manufacturers and used car dealers is that the supply of three-year-old cars is starting to ramp up and, maybe in a year or two from now, will exceed demand leading to a potential residual value price crash and an increased risk of loan default by consumers,\" he said. The SMMT predicted a slowing of growth in new car sales to 1% in 2014, as the rebound in demand from the lows during the recession fades. A breakdown of the figures showed the strongest growth in 2013 due to private buyers, which rose nearly 20% as consumers felt more confident amid economic growth and falling unemployment and were encouraged by attractive promotions. The Ford Fiesta was the best-selling new car in the UK last year, followed by the Ford Focus, Vauxhall Corsa, Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Golf. The SMMT said British buying patterns were shifting towards smaller, more fuel-efficient models, with \"supermini\" vehicles taking the largest market share of 35.9% in 2013. Registrations of hybrid and plug-in cars rose 20.5% to 32,715 vehicles. Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that the 2013 figures were an example of the growing UK economy: \"5 key measures of manufacturing at all-time high &amp; UK car sales top pre-2007 levels. See how we're growing UK economy.\" UK demand has consistently outperformed the rest of Europe where car sales have been falling. Spain was the only other major market to register a growth in sales last year, with volumes up 2.1%, driven by a scrappage scheme. The German, French and Italian markets all shrank. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight: \"The motor industry will be hoping that the recent improvement in UK economic activity is sustained and extended, and that this underpins consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars.\" Top 10 cars 2013 1.

The many uncertainties around medium-term growth, costs-of-change and capex are reflected in the broad range of forecasts in the market. Following its spectacular post-IPO performance, Royal Mail's valuation and dividend yield are no longer compelling. It is trading on a 2014 estimated PE of 14.7 times versus the European logistics sector on 15.2 times and other postal companies on 12 times. Our 2014 annualised dividend yield, at 3.2%, is below the wider FTSE 100, yielding 3.8%. Royal Mail shares are currently down 6p at 566p.",

    "webTitle": "Investigations launched into Co-op Bank's \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former directors of the Co-operative Bank face fines and bans from the financial services industry after two more investigations into the events leading up to its \u00a31.5bn bailout were announced . The Bank of England's regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, made formal announcements of enforcement investigations into the events that led to a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall being revealed last June. The investigations could take months to complete and mean that an independent review commissioned by George Osborne in November will be delayed until decisions are made about whether to take any action against the bank and its former management. Investigations into other bank problems have taken years. The outcome of an investigation into the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in September 2008 is not expected to be published until this summer while the report into Royal Bank of Scotland was published three years after its taxpayer bailout. The investigations may find no personal wrongdoing. For instance, no individual at RBS was found to be legally responsible for its near collapse while at HBOS only former banker Peter Cummings has been fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from working in the City. After a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was identified by the PRA, the Co-op bank had to be rescued by bondholders \u2013 including US hedge funds and as a result the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes has been left owning just 30% of the bank. A stockmarket flotation of the bank is possible this year and the new management said they were working with the regulators. \"The new management team had to rectify the difficult and complex issues that they have inherited,\" the bank said. The PRA said it was \"undertaking an enforcement investigation in relation to the Co-operative Bank and as part of that investigation will consider the role of former senior managers.\u2026 The Treasury has previously indicated that the independent review announced by the chancellor will not start until it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take.\" The FCA said its investigation would look at decisions and events up to June 2013. \"The independent review announced by the chancellor will commence once it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take. This sequencing is necessary to ensure that the outcomes of the enforcement work are not prejudiced and follows the approach taken for both the RBS and HBOS reports,\" the FCA said. The investigation by the FCA \u2013 which could go back as far as 2006 \u2013 is expected to include further analysis of information provided by the Co-op bank to its shareholders about its capital position in its financial statements. The accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, is yet to decide whether to launch a formal investigation. The crisis at the bank \u2013 which had prided itself on its ethical approach to business \u2013 deepened at the end of last year when its former chairman Paul Flowers was arrested following a Mail on Sunday report that showed a video of the 63-year-old Methodist minister handing over cash to apparently buy drugs. The report appeared just days after he had appeared by the Treasury select committee of MPs, which will continue its investigation into the Co-op's aborted attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, is scheduled to appear before MPs to discuss the role of regulators in the ill-fated attempt by Co-op to take control of branches, codename Verde. The situation sparked a political row about whether the coalition encouraged the aborted attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and whether the previous Labour government had championed Co-op's ill-fated merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009. It also generated concerns about the way the mutual Co-op Group is governed. Last month Lord Myners, the former City minister and one-time chairman of Guardian Media Group, was appointed to overhaul the structure of the Co-op, the country's biggest mutual. Co-op inquiries \u2022 Internal review (commissioned by the Co-op) by Sir Christopher Kelly \u2022 Review (commissioned by the Co-op) into corporate governance by new non-executive director Lord Myners \u2022 Independent investigation ordered by George Osborne, which will not start until Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) complete their work \u2022 Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy regulator, is looking at financial statements but has not launched a formal investigation \u2022 Treasury select committee investigation into the Co-op's attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group \u2022 Enforcement investigation by PRA \u2022 Enforcement investigation by FCA",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Former directors of the Co-operative Bank face fines and bans from the financial services industry after two more investigations into the events leading up to its \u00a31.5bn bailout were announced .</p> <p>The Bank of England's regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, made formal announcements of enforcement investigations into the events that led to a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall being revealed last June. The investigations could take months to complete and mean that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/inquiries-co-op-bank-chairman-paul-flowers\" title=\"\">an independent review commissioned by George Osborne</a> in November will be delayed until decisions are made about whether to take any action against the bank and its former management.</p> <p>Investigations into other bank problems have taken years. The outcome of an investigation into the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in September 2008 is not expected to be published until this summer while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/rbs-abn-amro-fsa-report\" title=\"\">the report into Royal Bank of Scotland</a> was published three years after its taxpayer bailout. The investigations may find no personal wrongdoing. For instance, no individual at RBS was found to be legally responsible for its near collapse while at HBOS only former banker Peter Cummings has been<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/14/hbos-banker-attacks-city-regulators\" title=\"\"> fined \u00a3500,000 and banned from working in the City</a>.</p> <p>After a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was identified by the PRA, the Co-op bank had to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/29/co-operative-group-retail\" title=\"\">rescued by bondholders</a> \u2013 including US hedge funds and as a result the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes has been left owning just 30% of the bank. A stockmarket flotation of the bank is possible this year and the new management said they were working with the regulators. \"The new management team had to rectify the difficult and complex issues that they have inherited,\" the bank said.</p> <p>The PRA said it was \"undertaking an enforcement investigation in relation to the Co-operative Bank and as part of that investigation will consider the role of former senior managers.\u2026 The Treasury has previously indicated that the independent review announced by the chancellor will not start until it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take.\"</p> <p>The FCA said its investigation would look at decisions and events up to June 2013. \"The independent review announced by the chancellor will commence once it is clear that it will not prejudice any actions that the regulators may take. This sequencing is necessary to ensure that the outcomes of the enforcement work are not prejudiced and follows the approach taken for both the RBS and HBOS reports,\" the FCA said.</p> <p>The investigation by the FCA \u2013 which could go back as far as 2006 \u2013 is expected to include further analysis of information provided by the Co-op bank to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-operative-group-admits-regulators-questioning-financial-strength\" title=\"\">shareholders about its capital position in its financial statements</a>. The accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, is yet to decide whether to launch a formal investigation.</p> <p>The crisis at the bank \u2013 which had prided itself on its ethical approach to business \u2013 deepened at the end of last year when its former chairman Paul Flowers was arrested following a Mail &#xa0;on Sunday report that showed a video of the 63-year-old Methodist minister handing over cash to apparently buy drugs. The report appeared just days after he had appeared by the Treasury select committee of MPs, which will continue its investigation into the Co-op's aborted attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, is scheduled to appear before MPs to discuss the role of regulators in the ill-fated attempt by Co-op to take control of branches, codename Verde.</p> <p>The situation sparked a political row about whether the coalition encouraged the aborted attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and whether the previous Labour government had championed Co-op's ill-fated merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009. It also generated concerns about the way the mutual Co-op Group is governed.</p> <p>Last month Lord Myners, the former City minister and one-time chairman of Guardian Media Group, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/12/myners-co-op-board-salary-former-city-minister\" title=\"\">appointed to overhaul the structure of the Co-op, the country's biggest mutual</a>.</p> <h2>Co-op inquiries</h2> <p>\u2022 Internal review (commissioned by the Co-op) by Sir Christopher Kelly</p> <p>\u2022 Review (commissioned by the Co-op) into corporate governance by new non-executive director Lord Myners</p> <p>\u2022 Independent investigation ordered by George Osborne, which will not start until Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) complete their work</p> <p>\u2022 Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy regulator, is looking at financial statements but has not launched a formal investigation</p> <p>\u2022 Treasury select committee investigation into the Co-op's attempt to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group</p> <p>\u2022 Enforcement investigation by PRA</p> <p>\u2022 Enforcement investigation by FCA</p>",
