    "webTitle": "RBS shares slump 8% on \u00a38bn losses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland fell nearly 8% on Thursday, after the bailed-out bank posted a loss of more than \u00a38bn \u2013 its sixth consecutive multi-billion loss since its 2008 taxpayer rescue. New chief executive Ross McEwan confirmed the bank was still paying out bonuses of \u00a3576m, despite the huge loss \u2013 to \"keep people engaged\" \u2013 and announced another major overhaul of its structure. But RBS also put the City on notice that it could be ready for a pre-election sale of part of the taxpayer's stake early next year. RBS and the government had hoped to sell a first batch of shares toward the end of this year but unexpected costs for settling litigation and regulatory disputes disrupted that plan. Sir Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, said: \"All we can do is to put the bank back in a state where we can write a prospectus, so there is a reasonable amount of clarity. I think we will have much more clarity by the time we get into 2015.\" The eventual timing of any sale would be up to the government, he added. The taxpayer owns 81% of RBS after investing \u00a345bn in its shares to prevent the bank collapsing at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. Selling the first tranche of shares before next May's election would let the chancellor boast he was on the road to getting money back from both bank rescues. Lloyds Banking Group, also bailed out in the crisis, is preparing for a sale of the government's remaining 33% stake this year. RBS's \u00a33.8bn of costs for litigation, fines and compliance and \u00a34.8bn of losses on troubled assets contributed to the vast \u00a38.24bn annual loss \u2013 more than \u00a322m a day. However, RBS intends to pay \u00a3576m in staff bonuses for last year. The bonus pool is down 15% from 2012, and only \u00a32,000 per person will be paid out in cash with the rest in deferred shares \u2013 but the decision revived uproar over pay at a bank kept afloat by taxpayers. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: \"The public will simply not understand why big bonuses and large salaries continue to be paid out by a loss-making public enterprise, still under-performing in many areas.\" He added: \"If RBS is to become the sensible, boring bank envisaged by the chief executive, the bonus culture will have to go.\" McEwan acknowledged that the bonus figure was \"highly emotional\" but insisted he needed to hold on to his best people to revive RBS, which owns NatWest and Ulster Bank. \"I need to pay these people fairly in the marketplace to do the job,\" he said. Bankers' bonuses continue to plague the industry. Barclays increased bonuses by 10% last week to \u00a32.4bn. HSBC said on Monday it would increase salaries for bosses to get around an EU bonus cap. McEwan, who has turned down his bonus for 2013, declined to say whether RBS would ask shareholders, including the government, for permission to circumvent the EU cap this year. \"The board has not opined,\" he said. RBS shares fell 7.74% to 326.6p, wiping more than \u00a33bn off its market value. It now has a stock market value of \u00a337bn. RBS had warned last month that its pretax loss would be about \u00a38bn but investors were unnerved by an operating loss of \u00a32.3bn \u2013 worse than the \u00a31.7bn analysts expected. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"We currently see no relative or absolute support for RBS's 'frothy' valuation; a correction is due. Sell.\" McEwan, who took over in October after Stephen Hester was forced out by the chancellor, George Osborne, said RBS had lost touch with its customers before the financial crisis and had to repair the damage. He described RBS as \"the least trusted bank in the least trusted sector in the marketplace.\" His new plans to revitalise the business include: \u2022 Refocusing on UK rather than global customers \u2013 to increase the share of total assets from Britain from 60% to 80%. \u2022 Shrinking RBS from seven businesses into three: personal and business banking, commercial and private banking, and corporate and institutional banking. \u2022 Simplifying products for retail and small business customers, including scrapping \"teaser rates\" and 0% credit card transfers. He said it was \"abhorrent\" that new customers got a better deal than longstanding clients and said customers hated such schemes. \u2022 Cutting costs because the bank is \"too expensive and too bureaucratic\". McEwan's plan will cut out large swaths of head office and administrative staff. Declining to put a figure on potential job cuts, he also said that RBS \u2013 which employs 120,000 people \u2013 could scrap more businesses that customers did not need. The bank has already quit equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and structured finance. McEwan refused to be drawn on RBS's plans for a possible yes vote to Scottish independence in September, saying: \"This is an issue for Scotland. The people have to decide and the governments will agree and we need to be thinking about the plans around that.\" By contrast, Standard Life said on Thursday it was working on contingency plans to move its base from Edinburgh to London if Scotland leaves the UK. McEwan's neutrality was compromised by an assessment of the consequences of independence on page 140 of the results that warned a yes vote for a separate Scotland \"would be likely to significantly impact the group's credit ratings and could also impact the fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory landscape to which the group is subject.\" Commenting on the results and the restructuring, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"The chancellor said last year that he wanted RBS to be a bank that is focused on lending to British businesses and families. The plan, announced by Ross McEwan and the board today, delivers that vision.\"",

But RBS also put the City on notice that it could be ready for a pre-election sale of part of the taxpayer's stake early next year.</p> <p>RBS and the government had hoped to sell a first batch of shares toward the end of this year but unexpected costs for settling litigation and regulatory disputes disrupted that plan.</p> <p>Sir Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, said: \"All we can do is to put the bank back in a state where we can write a prospectus, so there is a reasonable amount of clarity. I think we will have much more clarity by the time we get into 2015.\"</p> <p>The eventual timing of any sale would be up to the government, he added. The taxpayer owns 81% of RBS after investing \u00a345bn in its shares to prevent the bank collapsing at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.</p> <p>Selling the first tranche of shares before next May's election would let the chancellor boast he was on the road to getting money back from both bank rescues. Lloyds Banking Group, also bailed out in the crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/07/lloyds-banking-group-nears-government-stake-sale\" title=\"\">is preparing for a sale of the government's remaining 33% stake this year</a>.</p> <p>RBS's \u00a33.8bn of costs for litigation, fines and compliance and \u00a34.8bn of losses on troubled assets contributed to the vast \u00a38.24bn annual loss \u2013 more than \u00a322m a day. However, RBS intends to pay \u00a3576m in staff bonuses for last year. The bonus pool is down 15% from 2012, and only \u00a32,000 per person will be paid out in cash with the rest in deferred shares \u2013 but the decision revived uproar over pay at a bank kept afloat by taxpayers.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: \"The public will simply not understand why big bonuses and large salaries continue to be paid out by a loss-making public enterprise, still under-performing in many areas.\" He added: \"If RBS is to become the sensible, boring bank envisaged by the chief executive, the bonus culture will have to go.\"</p> <p>McEwan acknowledged that the bonus figure was \"highly emotional\" but insisted he needed to hold on to his best people to revive RBS, which owns NatWest and Ulster Bank. \"I need to pay these people fairly in the marketplace to do the job,\" he said.</p> <p>Bankers' bonuses continue to plague the industry. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/21/britains-bank-bosses-share-payments-eu-bonus-cap\" title=\"\">Barclays increased bonuses by 10% last week</a> to \u00a32.4bn. HSBC said on Monday it would increase salaries for bosses to get around an EU bonus cap.</p> <p>McEwan, who has turned down his bonus for 2013, declined to say whether RBS would ask shareholders, including the government, for permission to circumvent the EU cap this year. \"The board has not opined,\" he said.</p> <p>RBS shares fell 7.74% to 326.6p, wiping more than \u00a33bn off its market value.

      "bodyText": "AO World, the online appliance seller, cooked up a cash bonanza of up to \u00a329m for bankers when the website floated on the stockmarket this week. Rothschild, AO's main financial adviser in the run up to the flotation, will make \u00a312m in fees, or 1% of the company's initial market capitalisation, and could also receive a further \u00a3500,000 \"at the company's discretion,\" according to the prospectus released late on Wednesday. Meanwhile, JP Morgan, Jefferies International and Numis Securities, which all acted as underwriters to the float, will share about \u00a310.6m. They could also get a further \u00a34.2m at AO's discretion. JP Morgan also has a chance to earn a further \u00a31.56m fee as the bank arranged a so-called \"green shoe\" offer. This will be triggered if there is strong enough demand for the stock and would mean a further 22m shares being put on the market. The bankers' payments dwarf the company's \u00a38.7m pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 2013, as analysts said the ratio of AO's valuation to its earnings was reminiscent of the dotcom boom. Back when the potential for the internet was first spotted in the late 1990s, technology company valuations soared before crashing when the bubble burst in 2001. AO achieved a bumper market capitalisation of \u00a31.2bn on Wednesday, four times the valuation bankers put on the company only last year. The shares soared in initial trading from the launch price of 285p to 378p, valuing the company at \u00a31.6bn at close of play on Wednesday. On Thursday the shares slid 2.9% as a sense of reality began to return, wiping nearly \u00a350m off its value. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said AO's initial valuation was \"somewhat excessive\". He added: \"AO's excellent customer service has clearly excited investors, but AO has yet to prove that its recent UK success (following the demise of Comet) is sustainable.\" The excitement over AO matches the fervour around online fashion retailer Asos and online grocer Ocado, both of which have seen their valuations climb to new heights in the last year. John Roberts, the former kitchen salesman who founded and still leads AO, made \u00a386m from selling some of his shares in the business ahead of the flotation and still holds a stake worth more than \u00a3408m. But analysis of the prospectus reveals that Roberts and his fellow shareholders had already split \u00a32.8m in dividends last year, as they took the first payout from the company in at least three years. Roberts, who owned about 38% of the company's shares before the flotation, would have taken home just over \u00a31m of that dividend payment even as he prepared to hand the company over to the public markets. The founder, who has committed to staying with the company, said last month: \"We are not taking profits and running for the hills or refinancing our balance sheet to pay off debts.\" However, the payouts to founder shareholders and their advisers are likely to lead to heavy exceptional costs on AO's maiden results announcement this spring. They also set the bar for a longed-for revival in bankers' fees as a string of retailers head for the stockmarket in the next few months. While convenience store group McColl's only managed a valuation slightly lower than it had hoped for when it joined the market this week, online fashion retailer Boohoo.com, specialist retailer Pets at Home and discounter Poundland are all expected to be embraced by the stock market in the next few weeks.

Our scorecard shows who\u2019s performing best when it comes to customer service, ethics, contributing to the local economy and more. Yes, you guessed it, RBS came second from last. </p> <p>From RBS we\u2019re seeing too little far too late, and those with true local values are those that are winning.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-530f0a6ae4b0fa8384b0c41d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-27T10:04:52.877Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">RBS - what the analysts say</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>RBS had been expected to make another large loss, but City analysts are warning that today\u2019s results are weaker than ecpected.</p> <p><b>Ian Gordon</b> of <b>Investec</b> sums it up:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Revenues of \u00a319.4bn, down \u00a32.6bn (12%) year-on-year, were a \u00a30.6bn (3%) miss vs consensus (\u00a320.0bn).

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. To recap: Cyprus\u2019s bailout programme has been thrown into uncertainty after MPs failed to support a plan to privatise three state assets. Tonight, the parliament voted 25-25 (with five abstentions) on whether to sell off the country\u2019s electricity provider, telecoms operator and ports authority. The privatisation is part of Cyprus\u2019s bailout plan -- without it, the country may not receive its next aid tranche. A second vote could be held next week. The rejection came as hundreds of striking workers protested outside the Nicosia parliament, saying the selloff would be a disaster for Cyprus. Latest photos here. The news came at the end of a busy day..... Royal Bank of Scotland shares have slumped 7.75% after reporting a \u00a38.2bn loss at 7am, and unveiling its new strategic plan Analysts said the company is still dealing with the legacy of Fred Goodwin... ...and dogged by fears that it needs to raise more capital. This earlier summary gives more details of RBS\u2019s results, its strategic plan, and the row over the bank\u2019s \u00a3576m bonus payouts. While in America, Fed chair Janet Yellen said the US central bank is watching closely to see whether recent \u2018soft\u2019 economic data is due to the bad weather. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Associated Press just published a good take on the situation: Cyprus Parliament Turns Down Privatization Bill Cyprus\u2019 lawmakers on Thursday effectively forced the government to renegotiate terms of legislation that would pave the way for the privatization of state-owned companies, a condition of the debt-laden country\u2019s rescue deal with international lenders. The vote throws into doubt whether Cyprus will receive the next batch of bailout money that the government said is necessary to stave off bankruptcy. The country has until March 5 to pass the legislation which several parties including left-wing AKEL and socialist EDEK had staunchly opposed. Lawmakers voted 25 in favor, 25 against and five abstained. The tie meant the legislation was turned down. \u201cWe must now deal with what happens next with the rescue program,\u201d Prodromos Prodormou, spokesman for the ruling right-wing Democratic Rally Party, told state broadcaster CyBC. EDEK lawmaker George Varnava said it\u2019s up to the government to renegotiate the bill with international lenders. AKEL leader Andros Kyprianou told parliament before the vote that his party would not consent to the \u201csell off of the nation\u2019s wealth\u201d and denounced what he called the \u201cblackmail\u201d of international lenders. \u201cWe have warned for months now that we would reject this legislation,\u201d Kyprianou told CyBC, adding that the government should enter into dialogue with parties on alternatives. Cyprus government spokesman Christos Stylianides warned earlier Thursday that rejection of the bill would risk pushing the country into bankruptcy in the next couple of months. Hundreds of people had gathered outside parliament to protest against the bill. Barricades police in full riot gear prevented protesters from nearing the parliament\u2019s entrance. More photos from the demonstrations outside the parliament, led by striking electricity workers who urged MPs to oppose the privatisation plan: George Iordanou, a PhD student and Cyprus expert, explains that the Nicosia government can\u2019t simply bring the same legislation back next week - changes will be needed. The Cypriot parliament is developing quite a reputation: eleven months ago, it sensationally voted down the original bailout terms (under which all bank accounts were tapped), forcing a rethink. To recap, the bill rejected tonight would have cleared the way to sell three state-owned bodies: Cyprus Telecoms, the Electricity Authority and the Cyprus Ports Authority, raising perhaps \u20ac1.4bn by 2018. The next tranche of Cyprus\u2019s aid package, worth \u20ac236m, was due to be paid in March -- but only if the privatisation bill was passed. The Cyprus Mail confirms that tonight\u2019s vote on whether or not to approve the privatisation plan demanded by the country\u2019s troika of lenders was extremely close: Parliament on Thursday night rejected the bill designed to pave the way for the privatisation of semi-government organisations, telecoms company CyTA, the electricity authority EAC and the Cyprus Ports Authority. The vote went 25 in favour, 25 against and five abstentions. To pass, it needed a majority vote in favour. It is possible a new bill will be submitted before the Eurogroup meets on March 5, the date they were due to give the go ahead for the fourth tranche of bailout aid, which is now uncertain. (more protest photos here) Eurozone crisis experts reckon Cyprus will cut a deal to get the privatisation deal though: Still, it\u2019s another reminder that while the eurozone is calmer, the crisis is not played out. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take on the Cyprus privatisation vote: Cyprus\u2019s parliament on Thursday rejected a privatisation plan that is necessary for the island to receive a new tranche of international aid. In a cliffhanger vote, 25 lawmakers rejected the bill, 25 approved it and there were five abstentions. Approval of the privatisations is mandatory under terms of a \u20ac10bn bailout the island secured a year ago, and for the fourth tranche of aid in March. Some late breaking news from Cyprus -- the Nicosia parliament has just rejected the privatisation bill that was debated today. That bill, as explained at 3.37pm, paved the way to sell off various state assets including its electricity supplier. That\u2019s a key demand of the country\u2019s lenders. A defeat looked highly possible after one of the government\u2019s junior coalition partners withdrew earlier today. From Cyprus, George Markides flags up that the bill could be voted on again next week: A late newsflash from Madrid: 27-Feb-2014 18:01 - SPAIN STARTS PLACING OF 7.5% OF BANKIA THROUGH ACCELERATED BOOK BUILD THROUGH MORGAN STANLEY, UBS AND DEUTSCHE SAYS UBS Another photo from the demo outside the Cyprus parliament: In case you\u2019re trying to catch up - here\u2019s the official lines from RBS: City analyst Louise Cooper pins the blame for RBS\u2019s \u00a38.2bn annual loss firmly at the door of the man who ran it until the financial criss struck: RBS reported a worse than expected \u00a38.2bn of pre-tax loss for 2013, mainly due to the corruption and incompetence of Fred Goodwin\u2019s days in charge. \u00a33.8bn was the cost of fines and customer compensation \u2013 the corruption. And a massive \u00a38.4bn charge was for loan losses \u2013the incompetence - half of which are still from the Irish Ulster Bank. Both these are legacy issues from Fred the Shred\u2019s time \u2013 paying the costs of illegal behaviour and the results of a poor quality loan book created under the anybody-can-get-a-loan-from-Fred-days. She also points out that RBS\u2019s report was bulked out with cautionary warnings of future legal risks: In detail the \u00a33.8bn was made up of \u00a3900mn PPI, \u00a3550mn Interest rate hedging and \u00a32.4bn fines and legal costs. But however it is made up, all the way through the clean-up, the costs of past filth have been greater than analysts and the banks have expected. Most are now forecasting the worst is over but note RBS had 16 pages of litigation and threats in its annual results statement (HSBC only had six pages \u2013 so in one area at least RBS is overachieving relative to its peers - the number of pages of naughtiness!). Fears that RBS will need to raise more funds to hit its capital reserve requirements helped to drive its shares down so sharply today, explains Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: The biggest faller today has been Royal Bank of Scotland after the bailed out bank confirmed losses of \u00a38.2bn, as well as announcing plans to restructure the existing business into three separate divisions. Today\u2019s losses weren\u2019t that surprising, given that they were flagged several weeks ago, but there is a concern that the bank will have to raise extra capital by further disbursements, including its US operation Citizens Bank, as well as the extra branches it has been trying to sell for the past two years. More than \u00a33bn has been wiped off the value of Royal Bank of Scotland, as the City gives its verdict to the company\u2019s \u00a38.2bn loss and strategic plan. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have closed down 7.74%, losing 27.4p to 326.6p. That means the company is worth almost \u00a337bn, down from just over \u00a340bn last night. Another photo from the anti-privatisation protests in Cyprus (3.37pm onwards) Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has said that recent disappointing economic data is probably partly due to the icy weather that struck America over the winter, but she\u2019s watching closely to see whether the US recovery is on track. Asked about recent softness in economic data, Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee that Since my appearance before the House committee [on 11 February], a number of data releases have pointed to softer spending than many analysts have expected. Part of that softness may reflect adverse weather conditions, but at this point it\u2019s difficult to discern exactly how much. In the weeks and months ahead, my colleagues and I will be attentive to signals that indicate whether the recovery is progressing in line with our earlier expectations. (Yellen\u2019s appearance had itself been delayed by two weeks because of heavy snow in Washington). Yellen also told Senators that monetary policy will remain accommodative for \u201cquite some time\u201d: \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict at all at the moment between the two goals the Congress has assigned to us of promoting maximum employment and price stability.\u201d She cautioned that \u201cfiscal drag\u201d had held back growth: Fiscal policy really has been quite tight and has imposed a substantial drag on spending in the U.S. economy over the last several years. And struck a positive note about the US recovery: \u201cI do think the economy is beginning to recover and we have made progress. And in the minimum, I would hope fiscal policy would do no harm.\u201d And here\u2019s AP\u2019s take on the protests in Cyprus: Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Cyprus\u2019 parliament to voice opposition against legislation that will pave the way for the privatization of state-owned companies. Barricades and a cordon of police in full riot gear have blocked off the street leading to parliament where lawmakers will vote on the bill later Thursday. Among the protesters are workers from Cyprus\u2019 electricity, telecommunications and ports authorities which have been earmarked for privatization. Privatizations are a condition of Cyprus\u2019 10 billion euro ($13.66 billion) rescue package that the country agreed with international lenders last year. The legislation is a prerequisite for Cyprus to receive the next batch of bailout money that the government said is needed to stave off bankruptcy. Lawmakers have introduced amendments to the legislation to protect workers\u2019 jobs and pension benefits. In Cyprus, hundreds of protesters massed outside the parliament building in Nicosia, in a face off with riot police. Reuters reports that they chanted \u201chands off\u201d, as MPs prepared to debate the privatisation of state assets, a key part of its bailout programme. The plan would see Cyprus\u2019s Ports Authority, telecoms operator and electricity authority, EAC, all sold off. EAC union leader Andreas Panorkos warned: \u201cThis bill will be devastating for the organisation, it will turn it into a private monopoly,\u201d The protests come as one of the government\u2019s coalition parties quits. That leaves the ruling Democratic Rally party, and another ally, controlling just 21 seats in the 56-member chamber Labour unions have staged strikes this week, leading to rolling power cuts, in an attempt to block the privatisations. The government, though, says the plan must be agreed by early March to unlock the next tranche of loans. Time to catch up. Royal Bank of Scotland has posted its sixth annual loss in a row, losing \u00a38.2bn after incurring heavy losses creating a bad bank and through litigation and PPI compensation. CEO Ross McEwan said RBS needs to change (VIDEO), as he unveiled a new strategic plan to refocus on Britain. He vowed to clean up RBS\u2019s image, and rebuild customer confidence. But the decision to pay out over half a billion pounds in bonuses had reignited anger over City pay. Business secretary Vince Cable said the bonus culture had to stop, while Lib Dem Lord Oakeshott dubbed RBS the \u201cRobber Baron Service\u201d. While a big loss was expected, analysts warned that the bank had performed worse than expected last year. RBS shares have tumbled 8%, wiping around \u00a33bn off its value. The Ukraine crisis has sent shares down across Europe, with the main indices falling up to 1.3%, while the Ukrainian Hryvnia hit a fresh record low. Standard Life has threatened to move its HQ out of Edinburgh if Scotland votes for independence. The CBI said the warning shows the depth of concern over the Scottish referendum, but first minister Alex Salmond dismissed the warning. S&amp;P said an independent Scotland would face challenges but not insumountable ones Lego has posted a 10% jump in revenues for last year -- thanks to strong demand to new brands and traditional offerings. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Alex Salmond, robustly rejected Standard Life\u2019s concerns -- telling the Holyrood assembly that the financial group would thrive after independence. During first minister\u2019s questions, Salmond said: \u201cMy submission would be that Standard Life would find Scotland a good place to do business, as it does in 10 countries around the world.\u201d More here: Alex Salmond says Standard Life would prosper in independent Scotland The CBI has weighed in on Scottish independence, saying Standard Life\u2019s worries are shared by many other firms: John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: \u201cStandard Life\u2019s announcement that \u2018it would take whatever action necessary to protect its business\u2019 underlines the concerns felt by many successful Scotland-based firms. \u201cFaced with uncertainties around currency, the shape and role of the monetary system, the European Union, future taxation and regulation, businesses need evidence-based clarity from the Scottish Government so future jobs and competitiveness can be assured.\u201d RBS\u2019s \u00a3576m bonus pot has now been criticised by Vince Cable, the business secretary, who said the culture of chunky bonuses must be swept away if the bank is serious about reform. I\u2019ve taken it from PA: Business Secretary Vince Cable has led a chorus of criticism from across the political spectrum of RBS\u2019s announcement that it will pay out \u00a3576 million in bonuses despite posting an \u00a38.2 billion loss for the year. Despite calls for bonuses to be curtailed, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan insisted the payments have a role to play in attracting and retaining the best staff. Dr Cable said: \u201cThe public will simply not understand why big bonuses and large salaries continue to be paid out by a loss-making public enterprise, still under-performing in many areas. \u201cThe smaller bonus pool is due to the bank\u2019s US-based investment banking operations, which will soon be sold. If RBS is to become the sensible, boring bank envisaged by the CEO, the bonus culture will have to go.\u201d I mentioned earlier that Ross McEwan argued RBS must pay the going rate to its bankers, adding \u201c I do need to be in the market to get people to do these jobs.\u201d But former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott was dripping with sarcasm: \u201cThey\u2019ve lost \u00a38.2bn of our money and they\u2019ve paid \u00a3576m in bonuses - what on earth would they pay if they made a profit? What does RBS stand for - Robber Banking Service? \u201cThat\u2019s the economics of the mad house, no normal business making a thumping loss like this would pay out massive bonuses. Banking is just on another planet. Wherever you look, RBS is a total disaster.\u201d Andrew Tyrie MP, the influential head of the Treasury Committee, makes an important point on Royal Bank of Scotland -- the people responsible for today\u2019s losses cashed in their bonuses many years ago. As flagged up earlier, setting up a bad bank cost RBS \u00a34.8bn, while compensation, fines and legal costs wiped out another \u00a33.8bn. This shows why bank bonuses should be paid in shares, and help on a long leash - meaning they can be yanked back if problems emerge in future years, Tyrie argued.: The losses today announced by RBS were partly caused by past misconduct and poor lending decisions. \u201cIt is likely that many who took those decisions were rewarded for them. Their remuneration should have been subject to deferral and clawback - paying for their mistakes. \u201cWell after the crisis broke, bonus schemes have continued to reward failure. There are not enough signs that banks understand the need for radical reform of remuneration. \u201cRBS has introduced deferred bonuses for only up to three years. That will do little in many cases to match the rewards to the maturity of the risk. \u201cA fundamental reform of the bonus culture is needed. Much longer deferral and much greater scope for clawback, as recommended by the Banking Commission, are an essential part of that. \u201cRemuneration, and particularly bonuses, can be a powerful tool for higher standards. Well structured, they can incentivise better behaviour and prevent bankers receiving rewards until it is clear that they have been earned.\u201d The Ukrainian currency, the Hryvnia, slumped to a new record low of 11 to the US dollar, after armed gunmen took control of government buildings in Crimea (our Ukraine liveblog has all the details) Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s tumbling share price has helped to knock the FTSE 100 into the red today, with the blue-chip index down 31 points, or 0.5%, at 6768. RBS shares are currently down 8%, meaning \u00a33.2bn has been knocked off its value today. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, sums up the mood: RBS have been condemned to a 6th straight year of losses this morning, with the continued headwinds of restructuring and misconduct costs dwarfing the \u00a32.5bln operating profit made elsewhere in the business. Pre-tax losses where \u00a38.2bn, and yet another set of horrendous numbers after years of rhetoric and numerous management shake ups seems to have run the patience of investors one step too far, who voted with their feet this morning, pushing the stock down to a firm last place in the FTSE. Shares are down across Europe, as the Ukraine crisis continues to spook the markets. German DAX: down 128 points at 9,533, -1.3% French CAC: down 23 points at 4,373, -0.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 189 points at 20,208, -0.9% Spanish IBEX: down 117 points at 10,106, -1.1% Speaking of the eurozone, Spain suffered a blow this morning with the news its economy grew less strongly than first thought. Spanish GDP growth was revised down to +0.2% in the last quarter of 2014, down from +0.3%, raising fears that its recovery from recession may be faltering. Followers of our eurozone crisis: Angela Merkel is starting to address the UK parliament right now. Full coverage here: Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, visits Britain: Politics live blog RBS has also warned today that its credit rating could be cut if Scotland declares independence -- which would push up its borrowing costs. On page 140 of today\u2019s report, it warns: A vote in favour of Scottish independence would be likely to significantly impact the Group\u2019s credit ratings and could also impact the fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory landscape to which the Group is subject Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has waded into the debate over Scotland, saying that going it along would be a \u201csignificant\u201d challenge, but not an impossible one. S&amp;P also declared that an independent Scotland would not probably suffer the ignominy of a \u2018junk\u2019 credit rating. Here\u2019s the key points: STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S: EXPECT INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND TO BENEFIT FROM ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF AN INVESTMENT-GRADE SOVEREIGN CREDIT CHARACTERISED BY ITS WEALTHY ECONOMY STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S: INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND WOULD FACE COMPARATIVELY HIGH PUBLIC DEBT, SENSITIVITY TO OIL PRICES, POTENTIALLY LIMITED MONETARY FLEXIBILITY STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S: INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND\u2019S EXTERNAL POSITION FOR LIQUIDITY AND INVESTMENT COULD BE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY SHOULD BANKS LEAVE STANDARD &amp; POOR\u2019S: CHALLENGE FOR SCOTLAND TO GO IT ALONE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT, BUT NOT UNSURPASSABLE Interesting timing -- given Standard Life\u2019s threat today to move its HQ out of Edinburgh....

Revenues surged by 10% as the company\u2019s traditional ranges, and new offerings, proved popular with children. And with The Lego Movie now a box office hit, the Danish firm has staged a remarkable recovery since flirting with bankrupcy a decade ago. Chief executive Joergen Vig Knudstorp declared that: \u201cIn less than 10 years, we have now more than quadrupled our revenue. In 2013 we successfully developed and launched products that children put high on their wish list all over the world.\u201d Lego posted double-digit growth in its \u201cevergreen\u201d product - such as DUPLO, the Technic and Creator range, and its Star Wars and City-themed products. New brands did well too. Lego Friends -- launch in 2012 and targeted at girls -- had \u201cshown its long term potential by also growing double digit in 2013\u201d. Legends of Chima (fantasy animals fighting over a power source) became a \u201cmajor theme globally\u201d, apparently. Speaking to reporters, Knudstorp acknowledged that developing fresh themes and continuing to appeal to children is a \u201cmajor challenge\u201d, adding: \u201cWith the level of growth we have right now we need to constantly think of expanding our facilities.\u201d Today\u2019s annual report also shows that Lego hired another 1,355 staff last year, swelling its workforce by 13% to 11,755. Lego is also expanding deeper into Asia, and building a factory in Jiaxing, China. When the factory opens in 2016, it will supply the growing Asian market with LEGO products, it said. Sales rose to 25.38 billion kroner (\u00a32.8bn), while net income increased 9 percent to 6.12 billion kroner (\u00a3700m). Lego is a private company, so a small number of shareholders will reap the benefits - as the FT\u2019s Richard Milne points out. Finally, spare a thought for the lucky family and foundation shareholders that own Lego. It paid out a whopping DKr22m per share last year and is forecasting a payout of DKr24.4m [\u00a32.7m] this year. Shame the 205 shares in the company are so tightly held. Many of those shares are owned by the family of carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen, who founded the business back in 1932. The full report is online here. (updated link). Speaking in London this morning, Ross McEwan was adamant that Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s global ambitions are consigned to history: So let me spell it out very clearly: the days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world - those days are well and truly over. He also warned that RBS\u2019s problems aren\u2019t over: Today won\u2019t be the end of bad headlines. Past failures will continue to haunt us. But we can weather them. Plenty else going on today. Advertising group WPP has warned that its profit margins have been hit by currency fluctuations, sending its shares down over 5% despite posting a bigger jump in earnings than rivals. The prospect of the UK government selling its 81% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland anytime soon is receding as quickly as its shares have tumbled. Will Hedden of IG says many investors find Lloyds more attractive, especially given RBS\u2019s grubby reputation: It is still hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel of nationalisation as a sixth straight annual loss misses expectations and highlights the job that still remains. Further offloads will come later in the year, as the bank streamlines itself into a more traditional entity. One has to feel that the continued political fever created by bonus-paying at the investment bank has kept many investors away. Considering that since the beginning of 2013 RBS shares have barely moved, while Lloyds shares have gained more than 60%, you start to understand why the latter has been more popular with investors and traders alike. We do not expect this to change in the medium-term, as the government stake and the frustration that this brings to taxpayers continues to cloud any investment potential. Three billion pounds has been wiped off the value of RBS so far this morning, with shares down 7.5% at 327p. Marc Kimsey, Senior Trader at Accendo Markets, says investors have been rushing to ditch RBS: The selling pressure here this morning is immense, investors cannot get rid of their shares quick enough and traders are substantially adding to short positions. The latest update is a shocker - With the financial crisis so far behind us it is concerning to see company still in so much trouble. If you can give me a reason to buy, I\u2019m all ears. City firm Jeffries is also unimpressed by RBS\u2019s financial performance, saying: Core costs were well above our estimates and this was the disappointing angle today. It cited the \u00a34.8bn cost of creating a Bad Bank for legacy assets (Jeffries expected \u00a34.5bn), adding: Clean pre-tax profits of \u00a31bn missed our estimate of \u00a31.3bn driven by \u00a3200m cost miss and \u00a3100m worse impairments in UK corporate. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg weighed in on the issue of RBS bonuses, saying it hasn\u2019t earned the right to pay staff what it wants: He told ITV1\u2019s Daybreak: \u201cA loss-making bank that is basically on a life-support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses. \u201cThe overall amount has been coming down. It needs to continue to come down. They are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet. At the moment they are not.\u201d Important point -- RBS\u2019s bonus pool may indeed have fallen 12% to \u00a3576m, but the total headcount is also lower. My colleague Hilary Osborne has analysed the changes announced by RBS today -- including its decision to end 0% \u2018teaser\u2019 rates to credit card customers who switch to it, and to abolish different rates to customers who bank online. RBS outlines changes \u2013 what will that mean for its customers? Charlotte Webster, campaign director of the Move Your Money campaign (which pushes for better banking) says RBS\u2019s pledge to focus on Britain and improve customer service comes rather too late: \u201cWe agree with Ross McEwan. The future of banking is with simple, small banks that can be trusted. But that\u2019s not RBS, nor will that be anytime soon. This restructuring is long over due, with billions of pounds of spending cuts a direct result of years of malpractice. But people are ahead of the game, we\u2019re seeing millions of pounds move away from the big five banks to one of over 50 small and simple banks across the UK. 2.4 million people since 2012, and that\u2019s set to escalate as the public realises just how simple it is to change banks or even explore new options like crowd funding. Our scorecard shows who\u2019s performing best when it comes to customer service, ethics, contributing to the local economy and more. Yes, you guessed it, RBS came second from last. From RBS we\u2019re seeing too little far too late, and those with true local values are those that are winning.\u201d RBS had been expected to make another large loss, but City analysts are warning that today\u2019s results are weaker than ecpected. Ian Gordon of Investec sums it up: Revenues of \u00a319.4bn, down \u00a32.6bn (12%) year-on-year, were a \u00a30.6bn (3%) miss vs consensus (\u00a320.0bn). Costs of \u00a313.3bn were \u00a30.1bn (1%) worse than consensus. Impairments of \u00a38.4bn were broadly in line, so taken together, the \u201cunderlying\u201d Operating Loss of \u00a32.3bn is a \u00a30.6bn (35%) miss vs consensus. Gordon has a Sell rating on the shares, predicting that \u201ca correction is due\u201d (and already underway, with the shares down 6% today). He also provided these chart, showing how earnings from RBS\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d operations has shrunk since the crisis began -- partly due to the winding back of its investment banking, or Markets, division: Some Twitter reaction to RBS\u2019s results, and Standard Life\u2019s threat to leave an independent Scotland: The government, which controls almost 81% of RBS\u2019s shares, has backed Ross McEwan\u2019s turnaround plan: The Chancellor said last year that he wanted RBS to be a bank that is focussed on lending to British businesses and families. \u201cThe plan, announced by Ross McEwan and the Board today, delivers that vision and is further evidence of RBS\u2019s new management getting to grips with the problems of the past and taking the bank in its new direction.\u201d The Robin Hood Tax Campaign, which is lobbying for a financial transactional tax, is also aghast to see more bonuses at RBS. David Hillman said: This beggars belief. In what other industry would a staff at a state owned company that helped bring the economy to its knees be lavishly rewarded for massive losses? This is yet another example of one rule for the City another for the rest of us. It is time we made banks work in our interests rather than the other way around. That, of course, is what Ross McEwan is promising - with his talk of rewarding customer loyalty, rebuilding trust and delivering a better service. The opposition Labour party has slammed RBS for paying over half a billion pounds in bonuses after recording its sixth annual loss in a row in 2013. Chris Leslie MP, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: \u201cTaxpayers will be incredulous that such large bonuses continue to be paid out at a time when huge losses are being made. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that RBS starts to serve the British economy better and that we ensure taxpayers get their money back, so we are encouraged by the new longer-term strategy set out by Ross McEwan today. Leslie also urged the government not to allow bonus payments of more than 100% base salary for the 2014 financial year. (Under EU rules, future bonuses can only be 200% of basic pay if shareholders agree). \u201cWith bumper bonuses across a number of banks this year the government should now repeat Labour\u2019s successful tax on bank bonuses. George Osborne should also make clear now that he would reject any request from RBS later this year for approval to pay bonuses of more than 100 per cent of salary. At a time when ordinary families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to business is down it cannot be justified.\u201d RBS also cited the Scottish independence vote as a potential threat to its business. Its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, told reporters: Clearly there are issues we are looking at \u2013 currency, the application of financial regulation, lender of last resort, credit ratings \u2013 which could affect us But there is real uncertainty about how any of these matters would be settled in the event of a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote and the outcome would depend on negotiations between the two governments. The other big City news of the morning is that Standard Life, the pensions and savings firm, has revealed it is drawing up contingency plans to quit Scotland if it becomes an independent country. Chairman Gerry Grimstone said the firm hopes to stay in Edinburgh, where it has been based for 189 years, but warned: \u201cWe very much hope that this can continue. But if anything were to threaten this, we will take whatever action we consider necessary \u2013 including transferring parts of our operations from Scotland \u2013 in order to ensure continuity and to protect the interests of our stakeholders.\u201d The firm is worried about the uncertainty that a Yes vote would create -- including what currency Scotland would use, its future monetary system, regulation, and fiscal policy.ld be able to join the European Union by the Scottish government\u2019s preferred March 2016 target date. Chief executive, David Nish, says the company has already begun registering new firms in England, as it waits for clarity on those issues. Here\u2019s the full story: Standard Life could quit Scotland if voters back independence Here\u2019s three key points from McEwan\u2019s turnaround plan to regain the trust of the public and RBS\u2019s customers: Shrinking RBS from seven businesses into three: personal and business banking, commercial and private banking, and corporate and institutional banking. Simplifying products for retail and small business customers, including scrapping \u201cteaser rates\u201d and 0% credit card transfers. Cutting costs because the bank is \u201ctoo expensive and too bureaucratic\u201d. And here\u2019s Sean Farrell\u2019s news story on Royal Bank of Scotland, which will be updated through the day. RBS shares continue to fall as City analysts chew through the meat of today\u2019s statement -- now down 6.3% at 331.49p. Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, points out that RBS is still trying to fix the mistakes made before the collapse of Lehman Brothers: \u201cThe numbers make for grim reading as RBS continues to wrestle with the legacy of its troubled past. Many of the bank\u2019s targets are some years away, and in the meantime the overall loss is greater than had been expected, even after RBS had taken some of the sting out of the news with its pre-release announcement in late January. And while RBS\u2019s staff will share \u00a3576m in bonuses, there\u2019s nothing for shareholders, Hunter adds: Group income fell 10%, the cost base is high, leading to a cost income ratio of 73%, and the planned divestments of Citizens and Williams &amp; Glyn will provide further distractions. Meanwhile, the lack of a dividend payment and the sheer complexity of a restructure which will result in further elevated costs for the next two years are not positive for the investment case. There are some glimmers of light within the statement, such as a reasonable capital cushion, improving credit quality, an operating profit and a simplification of the group which should benefit the bank in due course. Veteran city analyst David Buik (who can normally be relied on to give the banks a fair hearing) says RBS has issued \u201cawful numbers\u201d today. On the bonuses, he reckons: The bonus pool of \u00a3576 million is unpalatable but very necessary to mitigate losses whilst the bank is in transition, in changing its culture from global international bank to domestic \u2018Boring Bank PLC!\u2019 \u2013 [which is] what the majority of the people in this country and the politicians want. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen 4.4% at the start of trading in London, down 15.7p to 338.3p. Ross McEwan told City reporters that today\u2019s loss shows that RBS needs to change its ways, as he outlined a new plan to focus on Britain On this morning\u2019s conference call, he declared: \u201cLet\u2019s be quite clear. We are too expensive, we are too bureacratic and we need to change.\u201d McEwan also defended the \u00a3576m set aside for bonuses, with the familiar argument that RBS is paying the market rate to retain staff. Sean Farrell tweeted the key points: McEwan only took over at RBS in October last year (promoted from running its retail arm), and has already waived his bonus for 2013 and 2014. The heavy losses suffered by RBS since 2008 came under Stephen Hester\u2019s management. But they were caused by the global ambitions of his predecessor - Fred \u2018the Shred\u2019 Goodwin - which were crushed by the financial crisis. RBS also set aside regulatory and redress provisions of \u00a33.8bn to cover \u201clegacy conduct issues\u201d. In plain English, that\u2019s the fines and compensation set aside to cover its role in the sub-prime mortgage scandal in the US, the payment protection mis-selling scandal, and the \u201cinterest rate hedging\u201d scandal. Here are the details: \u25cf As announced in a trading update on 27 January 2014, RBS has provided \u00a31,910 million in Q4 2013 covering claims and conduct-related matters primarily relating to mortgage-backed and other securities litigation. Regulatory and litigation provisions for the full year amounted to \u00a32,394 million. \u25cf An additional \u00a3465 million provision for Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) redress and related costs was booked in Q4 2013, making a total of \u00a3900 million for the full year 2013. Out of a cumulative PPI provision of \u00a33.1 billion, \u00a32.2 billion had been utilised by 31 December 2013. The remaining \u00a30.9 billion provision covers approximately 12 months at current levels of redress and administrative expenses. \u25cf A further \u00a3500 million provision was made in Q4 2013 for interest rate hedging products redress and administration costs, reflecting higher volumes, higher anticipated redress payments and recalibration of our methodology based on more recent trends. The total charge for the full year was \u00a3550 million making a total of \u00a31.25 billion of which \u00a30.2 billion had been utilised by 31 December 2013. More than half of RBS\u2019s \u00a38.2bn loss came from legacy bad debts --it recorded a loss of \u00a34.823bn for creating a \u201cbad bank\u201d called RCR where it stashed toxic assets. RBS CEO Ross McEwan has declared that he wants to make RBS the most trusted bank in the UK by 2020, with a new focus on its customers. In his message to shareholders, he declares: We now have a strategy to deliver a sustainable bank with a clear ambition: we want to be number one for customer service, trust and advocacy, in every one of our chosen business areas by 2020. To do this, RBS will be restructured to form a \u201chighly effective\u201d bank, so that it is \u201c structured around the needs of its customers\u201d (whose interests is it revolving around today, Ross?). Seven existing operating divisions are being realigned into three businesses: Personal &amp; Business Banking, Commercial &amp; Private Banking and Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking. Today, only 30% of RBS staff actually deal directly with customers -- that will be hiked to 50% by 2017 under McEwan\u2019s strategic review. And he also warned he won\u2019t hesitate to swing the axe: For those activities where we can\u2019t see a clear path to being number one, we will review on the basis of \u2018fix, close or dispose\u2019. These will become clear as each of our three businesses defines its new customer franchises over the coming months. You can see the results on the London Stock Exchange website (pdf). Most of the bonuses being paid out by RBS will be in deferred shares and bonds -- cash payouts are restricted to \u00a32,000 each. At \u00a3576m, the total bonus pot (\u2019total variable compensation\u2019 in banker jargon) is 12% smaller than a year ago. But taxpayers may wonder why \u2018their\u2019 bank is handing over so much money in bonuses, after another sizeable loss. Here\u2019s the details (from this section of the financial results) Good morning. Royal Bank of Scotland has reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a38.2bn for the last financial year, but will still pay bonuses of \u00a3576m, in a move that will inevitably fuel the debate over pay in the banking sector. RBS announced to the City at 7am that it had made a loss for the sixth year in a row -- partly due to having to set aside more than \u00a33.8bn to cover compensation payments and fines. But despite another year in the red, RBS is planning to pay over half a billion pounds of bonuses. That\u2019s down on the \u00a3679m paid in 2012, but unlikely to pacify critics who say City pay is out of hand. RBS\u2019s new CEO, Ross McEwan, is also announcing details of a new strategic review for RBS. It is based on refocusing the bank on its UK customers, and rebuilding trust in the company. He\u2019s speaking to journalists now, so we\u2019ll have lots more detail and reaction through the next couple of hours. A string of other companies are posting results this morning, including insurance group RSA (with delicious timing, it\u2019s now being run by ex-RBS boss Stephen Hester). It has announced a \u00a3775m rights issue. Standard Life, advertising giant WPP, housebuilder Redrow, theme park group Merlin, and Lego are also reporting -- but RBS could easily dominate the day. I\u2019ll round up all the key points -- along with our usual rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy and the eurozone.",

At the time, Witty was apologetic and announced his determination to stamp out such sales practices, only to see the company embroiled in another scandal within a year. The company has reiterated its commitment to China, despite admitting last autumn the scandal had wiped out two-thirds of its business there. Sales in China have recovered somewhat since then. The pharmaceutical giant's head of global research &amp; development and vaccines, Moncef Slaoui, received a total remuneration package of $8.4m last year, up from $6.6m in 2012. GSK hailed an exceptional year for research and development in 2013, with six major products being approved by in the US, nearly a fifth of all regulatory approvals in the country. Return on R&amp;D, an internal target, improved to 13% from 12%. Turnover rose 1% to \u00a326.5bn last year, lifting pre-tax profits by 0.7% to \u00a36.6bn.",

Profits before financial charges were approximately \u00a317.5m, according to unaudited figures. The retailer said trade was boosted by the fly-on-the-wall documentary series Liberty of London which aired on Channel 4 in December, with annual visitor numbers up 5% to 4.5m and like-for-like sales up 11.2%. The store, which has an archive of 40,000 prints, said its fabric wholesale business had also done well with significant growth in markets such as South America and the Middle East and demand for bespoke designs from the likes of Louis Vuitton and Chlo\u00e9. Liberty was bought off the stock exchange by BlueGem Capital for \u00a332m in 2010. Under its control sales have nearly doubled with the private equity firm, founded by a group of former Merrill Lynch bankers, recently selling a minority stake to international families from Europe and the Middle East for an undisclosed sum.",

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers have urged George Osborne to overhaul the business rates regime, saying the tax is blocking investment. In a letter to the chancellor seen by the Guardian, 10 leading manufacturers, including Tata Steel and carmaker Vauxhall, call for an independent review of the business rates system and urge action in the budget. The manufacturers say business rates are acting as a barrier to economic rebalancing and investment, preventing the expenditure that Osborne has said will power a \"march of the makers\" in the UK. The Treasury is already reviewing how business rates are administered, but the letter says the study does not fully address the concerns of manufacturers. If firms invest in equipment and machinery, the rateable value of their premises goes up. Manufacturers told Osborne that in some cases the tax increase resulting from such investments wiped out the benefit of efficiency savings. Vauxhall said it had, for example, abandoned plans to install solar panels at its plant in Ellesmere Port, Wirral, because it would have increased business rates. A spokeswoman for Vauxhall said business rates had always been an issue but had moved up the agenda because of retailers' calls for a revamp of the system. \"Large-scale manufacturers' voices are not being heard,\" she said. \"Retail is far more emotive to voters as they are on the high street.\" In the long term, manufacturers want to switch the system away from rates based on property values to a valuation based on the income generated by a property. Retailers are also calling for a rates revamp and released their initial ideas for change earlier this month. The British Retail Constortium presented those ideas to MPs at the communities and local government select committee earlier this week. However, Simon Danczuk, the Rochdale MP who sits on the committee, said the ideas were \"half-baked and subjective\" and intended to help out large supermarkets at the expense of small stores and manufacturers.",

The financial services firm, which has \u00a3237bn under management, highlighted uncertainties over an independent Scotland's currency, the shape of its monetary system, financial services regulation and taxes. It also raised questions about whether an independent Scotland would be able to join the European Union by the Scottish government's preferred March 2016 target date. Nish said these were \"the fundamental things we need clarity on to evaluate the decision we are making\". Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, has said Scotland would continue to use the pound without the agreement of Westminster, after chancellor George Osborne, along with Labour's Ed Balls, ruled out currency union with Scotland. Critics argue that Salmond's 'sterlingisation' proposal \u2013 dubbed the \"Panama option\" where Scotland adopts the pound with no currency agreement \u2013 would spell disaster for Scotland's financial services industry, leaving it without a lender of last resort or central bank.

Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said Standard Life's announcement \"doesn't surprise me\" because of uncertainty over issues such as currency and an independent Scotland's EU membership.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has defended plans to pay \u00a3588m in staff bonuses despite suffering an \u00a38.24bn loss in 2013 as it slumped into the red for the sixth successive year. The size of the bank's bonus pool fell 18% from last year but the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, acknowledged that the issue was \"highly emotional\" as he explained the multimillion pound windfall at the taxpayer-owned institution. \"I need to pay these people fairly in the marketplace to do the job. I do need to make sure we are there or thereabouts and that is all I'm asking for,\" he said. The latest annual loss was caused by \u00a33.8bn of costs for settling litigation and regulatory problems \u2013 including \u00a31.5bn extra to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps in the UK \u2013 and \u00a34.5bn of losses on bad assets. The company's shares fell 6.7% to 330.2p in early trading, wiping more than \u00a32.5bn off the market value of a business that is 81%-owned by the taxpayer. McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester in October, said RBS needed to regain the trust of its customers and the public. \"We happen to be the least trusted bank in the least trusted sector in the marketplace,\" he said. McEwan also announced plans to revitalise the business, including: \u2022 Refocusing on UK retail and business customers to increase the share of total assets from Britain to 80% from 60%. \u2022 Shrinking RBS from seven businesses into three: personal and business banking, commercial and private banking, and corporate and institutional banking. \u2022 Simplifying products for retail and small business customers, including scrapping \"teaser rates\" and 0% credit card transfers. \u2022 Cutting costs because the bank is \"too expensive and too bureaucratic\". RBS had warned last month that its pretax loss for the year would be about \u00a38bn but investors were shocked by an operating loss of \u00a32.3bn \u2013 far worse than the \u00a31.7bn analysts expected. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"We currently see no relative or absolute support for RBS' 'frothy' valuation; a correction is due. Sell.\" RBS was bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 with a \u00a345bn investment, following a disastrous expansion into risky investment banking and trading. The bank has since slashed those businesses but McEwan said the cuts would go further still so that its markets business served the basic requirements UK and European companies. He declined to put a figure on potential job cuts but he said RBS \u2013 which employs 120,000 people \u2013 could get out of more businesses that customers did not need after quitting equity capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and structured finance. Bankers' bonuses continue to plague the industry amid public uproar over past misconduct. Barclays increased bonuses by 10% last week to \u00a32.4bn. HSBC said on Monday it would increase salaries for its bosses to get around a European union cap on bonuses. McEwan, who has turned down his bonus for 2013 along with his executive team, declined to say whether RBS would ask shareholders, including the government, for permission to circumvent the EU bonus cap this year. \"The board has not opined,\" he said. McEwan replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive after Hester was forced out last year by chancellor George Osborne. At the time, RBS said Hester was leaving because a new boss was needed for the start of privatisation, possibly this year. But McEwan said his plan would take up to five years to complete, casting doubt on the government's ability to sell its 81% stake any time soon. McEwan said any sale was for the government to decide but that he was concentrating on doing what was needed to revamp the bank. \"I'm not saying five years is the time when the government moves. At some point the government would like to get out and our interests are aligned. He said 0% transfers and other introductory rates were \"abhorrent\" and that customers hated them. It was wrong to chase a new customer and \"dump them\" months later instead of giving the best deal to an existing customer. McEwan refused to be drawn on what plans RBS was making for a possible \"yes\" vote to Scottish independence in September. \"This is an issue for Scotland. The people have to decide and the governments will agree and we need to be thinking about the plans around that.\" By contrast, Standard Life said it was working on contingency plans to move its base from Edinburgh to London if Scotland leaves the UK. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The chancellor said last year that he wanted RBS to be a bank that is focused on lending to British businesses and families. The plan, announced by Ross McEwan and the board today, delivers that vision and is further evidence of RBS's new management getting to grips with the problems of the past and taking the bank in its new direction.\"",

The prime minister, in reacting to a bad Newspoll this week, has even suggested the tough job ahead of repairing the budget would inevitably lead to bad polling. But it remains to be seen whether talk of tough austerity will be just that. Deputy prime minister Warren Truss has suggested the budget \u201crepair\u201d will not be completed in this term, and the strategy reported in the Australian Financial Review appears to be to put the ugly costs of cuts to education and health off until after the election. Such a strategy is not only policy savvy, but economically smart, as there is almost zero need for Australia to embark on a bout of quick, deep austerity. At the G20 meeting last weekend, the IMF and the OECD suggested a number of measures which fit within the government\u2019s narrative of the need for \u201creform\u201d, but both organisations are less hyped up about the need for fast budget repair. The G20 communiqu\u00e9, which outlined Joe Hockey\u2019s desire for a greater growth target over the next five years, specifically stated of fiscal or government-led budget repair that the G20 nations would do so only in a manner which took \u201cinto account near-term economic conditions, so as to support economic growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path\u201d. Such wording underscores the view of the majority of the G20 nations that while perhaps, as Tony Abbott loves to say, no nation ever taxed its way to growth, neither is there much support for the view that cutting expenditure while growth is weak will do anything other than make things worse in the short term. When it comes to fiscal austerity the key is knowing when to embark on such a path, and then doing it in a manner that acknowledges the economic situation. The OECD has suggested that among the best areas to target are health and education. This certainly is in keeping with the Abbott/Hockey strategy. The reason for this was highlighted in a paper last year issued by the OECD on the \u201cPolitics of fiscal austerity\u201d. It noted that fiscal consolidation in advanced economies is required because with an ageing population and rising health costs, \u201cunlike previous recessions, the return of strong growth\u201d will not be enough to solve budgetary issues. By the time strong growth returns, the health bill will have continued to grow well beyond what it had previously during past recessions. But the paper also noted that \u201cas many European countries are finding today, cuts only deepen short-term economic woes\u201d. Certainly the experience of the Eurozone countries has shown that sharp austerity during an economic downturn appears to exacerbate the downturn. But the Eurozone is unique and perhaps the experience of those countries only serves to prove that if you are going to embark on a period of deep fiscal austerity, don\u2019t do it with a joint currency. When looking across the entire OECD, the link with higher austerity and weaker growth remains, but it is less strong. Certainly those countries with the lower growth tend to have tightened their budgets the most, but even the many nations with strongest growth lie in the middle of the austerity range and have not taken extreme measures. This suggests that if you are going to be austere, it\u2019s best not to go overboard. And certainly, Australia has adopted this approach over the past three years.

America as well, despite what the Republican party would have you think, has also indulged in sharp austerity \u2013 according to one estimate \u2013 the sharpest such austerity for 50 years. Australia was also fortunate that we were able to begin our fiscal consolidation when growth was near trend. The OECD has noted that past evidence of large austerity measures shows they work best when \u201cthe macroeconomic environment ... had already turned favourable before consolidation started\u201d. On this measure, the UK rather jumped the gun. It is well known however that Australia\u2019s debt situation is relatively better than other nations, for our economy has a lot less fat to trim than other nations \u2013 and thus has fewer easy cuts to find. On health, the OECD estimates efficiency reforms here would see only 0.5% of GDP in savings \u2013 certainly still a sizeable amount, but the second lowest among OECD nations: This suggests that the path back to surplus does not involve finding easy efficiencies \u2013 these have already been found. And given the government is already pledging to increase the annual defence budget by 0.5% of GDP, it means other cuts will need to be made \u2013 or extra revenue raised. It suggests that unless Hockey is also willing to look at the revenue side of the budget, there will be cuts in areas like pensions, and government sector wages and benefits. In this context, it is no surprise these areas have also been targeted in the pre-budget softening-up period.

That was the safe prediction here earlier this month, and it has proved correct. In the event, AO was priced at \u00a31.2bn and the shares flew a third higher on the first day of trading to value the company at \u00a31.6bn. But even the \u00a31.2bn valuation is daft. AO last year made bottom-line profits of only \u00a36.8m on sales of \u00a3275m. Punch those numbers through the calculator: 175-times earnings and 4.5-times sales for a distributor of low-margin electrical goods. Buyers, naturally, are imagining the growth to come. AO is expanding its UK ranges, will soon open an operation in Germany, and incremental sales are said come at better profit margins once the infrastructure is built. OK, but the valuation almost assumes AO is guaranteed to lead the entire European online market for electrical appliances and that competitors, such as Dixons and John Lewis in the UK, won't fight back. To believe AO is so valuable today you surely have to think the company is capable of making profits of at least \u00a380m on a sustainable basis within a reasonably short horizon, say five years. Then, at a \u00a31.6bn price-tag, the valuation would fall to a more sober 20-times earnings. Maybe it will happen. But \u00a36.8m to \u00a380m is one hell of a jump. Even at a compound growth rate of 50% for half a decade \u2013 in other words, astonishingly fast even for a whizzy online retailer \u2013 profits would still only have reached \u00a352m by 2018. You can't blame AO founder John Roberts for taking advantage of perfect conditions for floating an online retailer and banking \u00a386m himself. He has clearly built a slick operation and the reports of AO's excellent customer service are credible. If outsiders are willing to pay ludicrous prices for a slice of the action, that's their lookout. Or rather, it's a problem for the rest of us, as the fund managers are mostly betting with other people's money and pensions. It's alarming that the professionals seem to think every promising but untested online retailer is destined to become the next Asos. Maybe AO is the one, but at a \u00a31.2bn valuation, let alone \u00a31.6bn, the risks and rewards are hugely out of sync. Welcome to the bubble.",

Then, at a \u00a31.6bn price-tag, the valuation would fall to a more sober 20-times earnings.</p> <p>Maybe it will happen. But \u00a36.8m to \u00a380m is one hell of a jump. Even at a compound growth rate of 50% for half a decade \u2013 in other words, astonishingly fast even for a whizzy online retailer \u2013 profits would still only have reached \u00a352m by 2018.</p> <p>You can't blame AO founder John Roberts for taking advantage of perfect conditions for floating an online retailer and banking \u00a386m himself. He has clearly built a slick operation and the reports of AO's excellent customer service are credible. If outsiders are willing to pay ludicrous prices for a slice of the action, that's their lookout.</p> <p>Or rather, it's a problem for the rest of us, as the fund managers are mostly betting with other people's money and pensions.</p> <p>It's alarming that the professionals seem to think every promising but untested online retailer is destined to become the next Asos.</p> <p>Maybe AO is the one, but at a \u00a31.2bn valuation, let alone \u00a31.6bn, the risks and rewards are hugely out of sync.</p> <p>Welcome to the bubble.</p>",
