      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has outlined Labour\u2019s proposed employment measures to bolster the strength of unions and transform the gig economy in a speech to the Trades Union Congress. The shadow chancellor said the measures would produce a new workplace environment which would boost the UK\u2019s economy if the party formed the next government. \u201cOur programme of workplace reform will restore the balance between employer and worker, and it will do so by installing basic trade union rights in law again, modernising corporate governance structures and extending the opportunity for employees to share collectively in the benefits of ownership of their company,\u201d he said in Manchester on Tuesday. A Labour government would ban zero-hours contracts, repeal the Trade Union Act, clamp down on bogus self-employment, end private finance initiatives and set up a department for employment to implement the policies, he said. There would be a particular emphasis on workers in the gig economy. Workers in jobs with flexible hours and short-term contracts could be given similar rights to those in permanent work, including eligibility for sick pay, parental pay and similar benefits, he said. Government contracts would only be given to firms that allowed collective bargaining and a Labour government would relaunch employee ownership funds, under which staff at larger companies would receive shares in order to give them a stake in the profits and management of their firms. McDonnell also repeated a promise that Labour would spend \u00a3500bn over a decade to fix Britain\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. This would include road and rail, digital, research and development and alternative energy sources, he said, adding that the \u00a3500bn figure was supported by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), with whom Labour was working to develop the proposals. McDonnell received a standing ovation after the speech and the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said the measures would be applauded across the UK. \u201cIt is simply not right for the sixth richest country on earth to have allowed a situation to develop whereby a worker only knows if he or she will earn a wage that day when they get a text message to tell them that they have a shift,\u201d McCluskey said. Paddy Lillis, the general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: \u201cIt is clear that Labour fully understands the problems low-paid workers have in getting enough hours to make a weekly wage they can live on.\u201d A CBI spokesman said the group would examine McDonnell\u2019s proposals. \u201cThe CBI backs investment in infrastructure to help drive up UK productivity, but this must be done within the constraints of sustainable public finances. It\u2019s not clear that Labour\u2019s proposals meet this test.\u201d Earlier in the day, McDonnell dismissed the idea that Labour had been infiltrated by hardliners who were seeking to push out MPs such as Frank Field \u2013 who has now quit the party whip \u2013 and Joan Ryan, both of whom have had no-confidence motions passed against them by local parties. Rosie Duffield, the new MP for Canterbury, was also threatened with such a move. \u201cWe now have 500,000 members,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, mass party now, and of course those members want to get involved in discussions about policy, and also they will reflect at times their view about the performance of their local MP.\u201d One senior Unite official said MPs who faced deselection threats were at fault for failing to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies. At a fringe TUC meeting, Howard Beckett, an assistant general secretary who has been tipped as a possible future leader of the union, said: \u201cFor those who got a vote of no confidence, it\u2019s very much been with regard to their own voting record \u2013 people who abstained over the welfare bill, people who have repeatedly voted against the wishes of their electorate and use Brexit in a way that undermines the position of the party. \u201cThe biggest example is with respect to Frank Field\u2019s recent resignation \u2013 undoubtedly the bulk of his constituents had a vote of no confidence in Frank Field because he voted with the government whenever there was an opportunity to bring down a government that believes in austerity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco will unveil its new discount chain Jack\u2019s next week as the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket throws down the gauntlet to the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. The first of the stores, named after the Tesco founder, Jack Cohen, will be unveiled by the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday. Tesco has forced staff and suppliers working on the project to sign non-disclosure agreements and the retailer is saying little about its plans. But when the Guardian visited the Chatteris store on Tuesday a Jack\u2019s sign could be seen over the door, albeit covered with a blue tarpaulin, and branding was also clearly visible inside. Mainstream supermarkets have been searching for a way to get into the fast-growing discount market, having seen Aldi and Lidl steal their shoppers since the recession, when rising food prices encouraged Britons to shop around for groceries. The German chains control more than 13% of the UK grocery market, according to Kantar Worldpanel data, compared with less than 9% four years ago. Since taking the helm, Lewis has launched the low price \u201cfarm\u201d brands to take on the discounters. The brands, with fictitious names like Redmere, Woodside and Willow, are expected to be sold in Jack\u2019s. More recently it has replaced its cheapest \u201cEveryday Value\u201d brand with generic names like Bay Fishmongers, Ms Mollys and Butcher\u2019s Choice, which would also fit the bill. There is also a new Jack\u2019s branded grocery range. In Chatteris it was possible to see Nestl\u00e9 and Cadbury\u2019s chocolate on the shelves. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black expects the Jack\u2019s chain to encompass 100 stores, including around 60 of its small \u201cMetro\u201d supermarkets, some of which are struggling. \u201cTesco has a cohort of problem stores where the traditional Tesco offer is a square peg in a round hole,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey have got low footfall and low income hinterlands and Aldi and Lidl are taking everyone\u2019s legs away.\u201d During the summer months, Tesco started recruiting staff for a \u201cnew store format\u201d in Chatteris. The premises have been empty for four years since Lewis put the brakes on openings when he took charge in 2014. Tesco has 2,659 stores in the UK, a sprawling estate that includes 172 Metros. It is thought that Tesco Metros in St Helens and Edge Hill, Liverpool are among those destined to be converted to the Jack\u2019s brand. It is not the first time one of the mainstream supermarket chains has tried to fight back with a discount chain of its own. Sainsbury\u2019s joined forces with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 to launch a UK discounter, but the venture closed its 16 stores two years later after struggling to make a profit. In the mid-noughties Asda experimented with the Asda Essentials chain but gave up after less than a year. Tesco previously tried the discount route in the 1980s with Victor Value , but the move was abandoned after four years because the management team at the time feared it might undermine the main brand.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons is the latest major supermarket group to be challenged over equal pay for its shop floor workers in a claim which could cost the retailer an estimated \u00a31bn if successful. The law firm Leigh Day said it was seeking compensation for shop workers \u2013 predominantly women \u2013 who believe they are paid less than the mostly male workers in Morrisons\u2019 warehouses. Leigh Day said it would lodge a claim with the employment tribunal service next week on behalf of eight Morrisons shop workers, but added that around 80,000 employees could be eligible to claim back pay totalling more than a billion pounds. The latest move means Leigh Day is now bringing equal pay claims against all of the UK\u2019s \u2018big four\u2019 supermarkets. It has already begun legal action on behalf of 30,000 staff working in Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco stores. The law firm said warehouse workers were paid between \u00a31 and \u00a34 an hour more than their colleagues in shops at other major supermarket chains. \u201cWe believe that Morrisons, as with the other major supermarkets, has underpaid those working in its stores for a number of years,\u201d said Emma Satyamurti, a partner in law firm Leigh Day\u2019s employment team. \u201cOur clients believe that those working on the shop floor should be paid the same as those in the distribution centres, and a failure to commit to this is not only unfair but unlawful.\u201d The law firm argues that although work carried out in stores and warehouses is different, the work should be recognised as being of equal value. Claims have already been lodged with the conciliation service Acas, Leigh Day said, and it has written to the retailer\u2019s chief executive, David Potts, requesting pay and gender information for workers. A spokesperson for Morrisons said: \u201cWe are not aware of any court proceedings issued by a third party. We have received a letter asking us a number of questions about our pay policies. Our aim is to pay our colleagues fairly and equally for the job that they do, irrespective of their gender.\u201d The latest move follows similar actions against Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, which are working their way through the employment tribunal process. About 20,000 people are involved in the Asda case, where the latest ruling backed the shop workers\u2019 right to compare their jobs to employees \u2013 mainly men \u2013 working in distribution centres. Asda is due to challenge that ruling at the court of appeal in October.",

It has already begun legal action on behalf of 30,000 staff working in Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco stores.</p> <p>The law firm said warehouse workers were paid between \u00a31 and \u00a34 an hour more than their colleagues in shops at other major supermarket chains.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that Morrisons, as with the other major supermarkets, has underpaid those working in its stores for a number of years,\u201d said Emma Satyamurti, a partner in law firm Leigh Day\u2019s employment team.</p> <p>\u201cOur clients believe that those working on the shop floor should be paid the same as those in the distribution centres, and a failure to commit to this is not only unfair but unlawful.\u201d</p> <p>The law firm argues that although work carried out in stores and warehouses is different, the work should be recognised as being of equal value.</p> <p>Claims have already been lodged with the conciliation service Acas, Leigh Day said, and it has written to the retailer\u2019s chief executive, David Potts, requesting pay and gender information for workers.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Morrisons said: \u201cWe are not aware of any court proceedings issued by a third party. We have received a letter asking us a number of questions about our pay policies. Our aim is to pay our colleagues fairly and equally for the job that they do, irrespective of their gender.\u201d</p> <p>The latest move follows similar actions against Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, which are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/11/tesco-faces-4bn-equal-pay-bill-as-claimant-numbers-swell-to-1000\">working their way through the employment tribunal process</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/24/asda-mass-legal-action-equal-pay\">About 20,000 people are involved in the Asda case</a>, where the latest ruling backed the shop workers\u2019 right to compare their jobs to employees \u2013 mainly men \u2013 working in distribution centres. Asda is due to challenge that ruling at the court of appeal in October.</p>",

We are invited to be phlegmatic about the near-certain removal of the stock from the FTSE 100 index. Unilever will still have a listing in the London, runs the argument, so why make a fuss? The UK operations are staying put and the company is probably to be believed when it says Brexit didn\u2019t influence its thinking. Such points would be easier to swallow if Unilever had made a convincing case for choosing the Netherlands over the UK. But it hasn\u2019t. The desire to simplify is understandable since the twin-headed Anglo-Dutch model, which has survived since 1930, looks too clunky for the modern world. Fund-raisings and demergers are harder to execute, for instance. The problem is that Unilever\u2019s pitch for the Netherlands, which was set out formally for the first time on Tuesday, is too breezy. The company makes two main points. First, the Dutch NV company is already 55% of the whole. Second, there is more trading, or liquidity, in the Dutch NV shares than the UK plc version. On both scores, the best response is: so what? The 55-45 split is irrelevant since, from a technical perspective, it\u2019s as easy to jump one way as the other. The trading point perhaps has slight weight, but it\u2019s not a clincher: in a world where there\u2019s only one class of stock, liquidity will concentrated anyway. The NV versus plc debate is really a draw. A better question is to ask: who is inconvenienced by the decision to go Dutch? Investors in UK tracker funds, and funds with narrow UK mandates, are clear losers. They will be forced sellers of a highly-prized company once FTSE Russell, the body that strictly polices eligibility for UK indices, confirms that a Dutch-incorporated Unilever will be booted out. Of course, funds that track the eurozone Euro Stoxx 50 index, where Unilever\u2019s Dutch shares are a constituent, would be equally annoyed if the company had chosen to combine in the plc shares. But more money tracks UK indices than the Euro Stoxx 50 \u2013 it\u2019s roughly $200bn versus $90bn on one estimate. Perhaps the board wanted to keep the Dutch end sweet after the sale of the original Dutch-based spreads business. Or perhaps a company with a Dutch chairman and a Dutch chief executive was always likely to choose the Netherlands in a close contest. But, in a rational world, UK fund managers would have told Unilever to rethink and made the case that the UK, where two of three divisional headquarters will still be located, is also the natural home for the single holding company. In practice, UK fund managers, with only a couple of honourable exceptions, seem cowed by Unilever\u2019s lobbying. The necessary 75% majority will probably materialise. By rights, though, Unilever deserves to lose the vote. Jaguar\u2019s Brexit warning should need no repeating Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), would surely have hoped his stark warnings about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the UK car industry would have registered by now. Instead, he\u2019s felt obliged to have another blast, warning the prime minister that he cannot say for certain that any of the firm\u2019s manufacturing plants in Britain could continue to operate after Brexit day. Speth\u2019s latest attack will, no doubt, be portrayed as scare-mongering by those Brexit crusaders who, ridiculously, think there is \u201cnothing to fear\u201d from leaving the EU without a deal. What they fail to acknowledge is that the mass-market car industry, with its heavy reliance of fragile just-in-time delivery networks, is different even from the aerospace business, which tends to be higher-value and slower-moving. As pointed out here in the past, even the government\u2019s own industrial strategy describes tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU as \u201cfundamental to the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector\u201d. When Speth warns that friction at the border at Dover could put production in jeopardy at a cost of \u00a360m a day, he\u2019s merely totting up what the government\u2019s assessment would mean. JLR\u2019s Solihull plant alone has 1,000 lorry deliveries a day, remember. One can quibble with details in the company\u2019s estimate that a hard Brexit would cost \u00a31.2bn in lost profits, mainly from tariffs. The UK wouldn\u2019t have to impose tariffs on imported components, even if the EU did so. The level of sterling would matter, as would JLR\u2019s self-help measures. It\u2019s also impossible to move a car assembly plant overnight. But note Speth\u2019s words about the appeal of building cars in Slovakia in the long-term. He\u2019s probably not playing verbal games.",

      "bodyText": "In early 2007, the then chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, dismissed the idea that the slowdown in the US housing market had profound implications. It was, according to the man running the world\u2019s most powerful central bank, just a local affair. Everybody knows what happened next. Within 18 months the local problem in the US subprime mortgage market had ballooned into the biggest global financial crisis since the 1930s. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt 10 years ago this week, it was the catalyst for a month of turmoil in which no financial institution was considered entirely safe. Inevitably, the anniversary of those tumultuous weeks in late September and early October 2008 has prompted speculation about whether it could happen again. And, if so, what will be the cause? Looking around the global economy, there are plenty of potential candidates, including: Debt The 2008 crisis was caused by excessive debt levels, with low interest rates enabling households to borrow to consume while financial institutions borrowed to speculate. The appetite to borrow waned during the deep recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers but the failure to deal with the root causes of the crisis has meant debt levels have since risen and are now higher \u2013 as a share of global gross domestic product \u2013 than they have ever been. The financial system There have been attempts to make the big multinational banks safer since their vulnerabilities were exposed in 2008. Banks now have to hold more capital which can act as a buffer in the event that they suffer the sort of losses on their investments as they did in 2008. But three problems remain: the banks have largely fended off pressure for the sort of structural reform that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929; banking has become even more concentrated; and risk has migrated from the more toughly regulated banks to other parts of the financial system, such as hedge funds. Emerging markets The 1990s and early 2000s saw dress rehearsals for the global financial meltdown in countries as far part as Mexico, Russia, South Korea and Argentina, and there are once again signs of trouble. Low interest rates and the process of money creation known as quantitative easing has meant capital has flowed into emerging markets looking for higher yields than have been on offer in the west. Servicing that borrowing is now becoming more expensive as global interest rates start to rise. The crises in Turkey and Argentina this year are unlikely to be the last. Italy Banks in the eurozone have made much less progress than their American counterparts in increasing their equity capital and as a result would be much more exposed in the event of a slowdown in activity, let alone a full-blown recession. Italy\u2019s banks are particularly fragile. Jens Hagendorff, professor of finance at the University of Edinburgh Business School, says there is a \u201cdoom loop\u201d between banks and the government because Italian banks are major buyers of Italian government bonds and even small losses on those bonds would cause banks to be insolvent. \u201cWhat would follow will enter the history books like the Lehman bankruptcy\u201d, Hagendoff says. A trade war For now, the global economy appears to be shrugging off the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist measures but the real crunch point is likely to come in late 2019 and early 2020 when higher US interest rates start to bite and the impact of tax cuts fades. China Prompt and decisive action by Beijing helped the global economy through the worst of the 2008-09 recession but it was achieved through a credit binge and a package of public spending that dwarfed anything seen in the west. Much of the borrowing happened outside the regular Chinese banking system through so-called shadow banks. China\u2019s growth remains solid and there are signs of it becoming better balanced, but in some respects it encapsulates the state of the world 10 years after Lehman: it solved one problem but only by creating another: it is awash in debt; its banking industry looks shaky; and it is acutely vulnerable to a full-scale trade war.",

The crises in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/12/turkey-crisis-widen-and-options-running-out-erdogan\">Turkey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/argentina-austerity-peso-crisis-macri\">Argentina </a>this year are unlikely to be the last.</p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p>Banks in the eurozone have made much less progress than their American counterparts in increasing their equity capital and as a result would be much more exposed in the event of a slowdown in activity, let alone a full-blown recession. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/29/italys-eurozone-crisis-no-easy-fixes-for-the-european-central-bank\">Italy\u2019s banks are particularly fragile.</a> Jens Hagendorff, professor of finance at the University of Edinburgh Business School, says there is a \u201cdoom loop\u201d between banks and the government because Italian banks are major buyers of Italian government bonds and even small losses on those bonds would cause banks to be insolvent. \u201cWhat would follow will enter the history books like the Lehman bankruptcy\u201d, Hagendoff says.</p> <h2><strong>A trade war</strong></h2> <p>For now, the global economy appears to be shrugging off the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/13/trade-war-brexit-economic-effects-tariffs\">Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist measures</a> but the real crunch point is likely to come in late 2019 and early 2020 when higher US interest rates start to bite and the impact of tax cuts fades.</p> <h2><strong>China</strong></h2> <p>Prompt and decisive action by Beijing helped the global economy through the worst of the 2008-09 recession but it was achieved through a credit binge and a package of public spending that dwarfed anything seen in the west. Much of the borrowing happened outside the regular Chinese banking system through so-called shadow banks. China\u2019s growth remains solid and there are signs of it becoming better balanced, but in some respects it encapsulates the state of the world 10 years after Lehman: it solved one problem but only by creating another: it is awash in debt; its banking industry looks shaky; and it is acutely vulnerable to a full-scale trade war.</p>",

The UK\u2019s oil and gas industry warned that the record low was a cause for \u201cserious concern\u201d and left the sector at a crossroads. Just four exploratory wells have been drilled in the first eight months of the year, with the most optimistic projections pointing to a total of 12 expected by the year end.

The industry warned againsta tax grab in the budget, a prospect that has been raised recently. High oil prices mean the sector is set to generate \u00a310bn in free cash flow this year, a level not seen since 2010, but the Treasury\u2019s take is expected to be down a quarter on 2010, because of tax changes.

      "bodyText": "The Debenhams chairman has confirmed the ailing retailer will close stores but denied that the company is actively planning to do so through an insolvency process. Sir Ian Cheshire\u2019s comments come after weekend reports that Debenhams was working with advisory firm KPMG on a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that enables a business to exit unwanted properties and negotiate rent cuts across groups of stores. Debenhams would would have been the 31st retail and restaurant chain to have launched a CVA since last year, as high street businesses wrangle with the switch to online shopping, combined with rising business rates and other costs. Big high street names including Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and Jamie\u2019s Italian have all used the process to downsize, while Multiyork, Toys R Us and Poundworld tried CVAs before going into administration. Cheshire told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme it was \u201csimply not true\u201d that Debenhams was \u201cactively working\u201d on a CVA. He said Debenhams had rushed out a trading statement on Monday in response to the media speculation. Cheshire likened this to \u201cnosy neighbours\u201d who had seen someone in a suit entering their house, assumed he was an undertaker \u201cand by end of day you\u2019ve got cause of death and everyone\u2019s looking forward to the funeral\u201d. However, he admitted that Debenhams was likely to have fewer stores in future and was \u201cworking through what\u2019s appropriate\u201d in terms of closures over the longer term. The retailer said last year that it would close up to 10 stores and has already shut two. The likely closures come at a difficult time for department stores, with House of Fraser set to close at least 12 of its 59 stores after being rescued from administration by Sports Direct, while the owner of John Lewis has admitted that it will make almost no profit in the first half of this year. Cheshire said that \u201ccapacity would leave the market\u201d but insisted that Debenhams and the department store format in general was not dead as long as it continued to update itself for the 21st century. \u201cThere will be winners and losers. There is room for a Selfridges of the high street that brings newness and fashion and beauty,\u201d he said. John Webber, head of business rates at property advisory firm Colliers, said Debenhams was battling against a surge in business rates, which had added significantly to costs at some of its key sites. \u201cDebenhams is seeing the negative impact of the 2017 rating revaluation, which we believe has substantially added to its costs,\u201d he said. Colliers calculates that the rateable value of the Debenhams store in the Westfield shopping centre in White City, west London, has soared 133% since the 2017 revaluation process, giving a rates bill of \u00a31.3m, while rates at Debenhams\u2019 Oxford Street site in central London have soared by nearly \u00a32m to \u00a35.36m.",

    "webTitle": "Plans for new Cumbria nuclear power station on verge of collapse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plans for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria are on the verge of collapsing after the Toshiba-owned company behind it laid off 60% of its workforce and embarked on a final effort to sell the project. Toshiba was due to sell the NuGen consortium to South Korea state-owned firm Kecpo in early 2018, as the Japanese firm exits international nuclear projects and looks to recoup some of the \u00a3400m it has spent on the Moorside plant. However, Kepco has been delaying a final decision, due in part to the UK government signalling a new approach to financing nuclear power stations. That forced NuGen to cut 60 of 100 jobs on Tuesday, following a six-week consultation with staff. Unions said the the project\u2019s problems showed the need for the government to take a stake in Moorside. Justin Bowden, the GMB national secretary, said: \u201cThe looming collapse of this vital energy project has been depressingly predictable for months.\u201d The skeleton NuGen team is now focused on clinching a deal with Kepco by the end of the year before Toshiba writes the unit off entirely at the end of March 2019. Success will hinge on whether Kepco buys into a new financing approach for nuclear power plants that the government is exploring, known as the regulated asset base (RAB) model. Officials think it could deliver the government\u2019s nuclear ambitions more cheaply for consumers than alternatives. Failure would leave a huge hole in ministers\u2019 hopes for as many as six new nuclear plants, as well as costing the north-west thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of investment. The business secretary, Greg Clark, first said the UK was looking at RAB for new nuclear in June. That threw a spanner in the works for Kepco, which was planning on a financing model similar to Hinkley Point C, where developer EDF Energy was awarded a guaranteed price for electricity in return for taking on all the construction risk. The RAB model has mainly been used by water utilities dealing with long-term, capital-intensive projects. The Thames Tideway tunnel \u2013 London\u2019s \u201csupersewer\u201d \u2013 is one of the most high-profile and contentious recent examples. The approach involves a regulator \u2013 in the case of nuclear power stations most likely to be Ofgem \u2013 setting a fixed sum for the costs of the scheme, and a fixed return for the project\u2019s backers. Those returns would be funded by energy bill payers. France\u2019s EDF Energy, which wants to build a second nuclear power plant at Sizewell in Suffolk, is an enthusiastic backer of the model, which it believes would significantly reduce financing costs and therefore be cheaper for consumers. It envisages pension funds providing most of the capital for Sizewell C, which could cost in the region of \u00a316bn, encouraged by the certainty provided by using RAB. The economist Dieter Helm, an influential government adviser, has said that while society must decide whether it wants new nuclear or not, the financing system would be an improvement on the way Hinkley had been financed. \u201cThe market cannot decide. If that decision is to proceed, the RAB model is both plausible and preferable to the Hinkley model,\u201d he wrote. But the model is likely to be ditched if Jeremy Corbyn comes to power. Labour called the mix of RAB and nuclear power a \u201cspectacularly risky deal for consumers\u201d. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy minister, said: \u201cUsing customers\u2019 bills to make a bet that construction of such large and complex projects will not overrun in terms of cost or time is a reckless act.\u201d Industry sources said the recent appointment of Thames Tideway\u2019s former chief financial officer, Mark Corben, at the business department was a \u201cvery positive sign\u201d that the government has swung behind the approach. A team of about 30 government officials is being assembled to work on new nuclear financing, the Guardian understands. The government\u2019s feasibility study on using RAB for new nuclear is expected in January.",

      "bodyText": "The pound hit its highest level since early August this morning, at $1.3087, on hopes that a Brexit deal can be struck by November. It has since given up those gains and is now trading 0.3% lower on the day, but remains close to five-week highs. Against the euro, sterling is up 0.2% at 89.16 pence. News that Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who was due to step down next June, would stay on until the end of January 2020 to oversee a \u201csmooth\u201d Brexit failed to lift the pound, ahead of the bank\u2019s monthly meeting on Thursday. The extension is shorter than some expected. We\u2019ve also had strong UK labour market data today. Regular pay growth in July picked up to the fastest rate in three years, while job vacancies hit a record high and the unemployment rate remained at 4%, the lowest since 1975. Despite the pick-up in pay growth, average weekly wages are still lower than before the financial crisis in 2008, remaining \u00a331 below the pre-crisis average. Following a positive open, European stocks took a tumble after it emerged that China plans to ask the World Trade Organisation next week for permission to impose sanctions on the US, for Washington\u2019s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over US dumping duties. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Good-bye! FTSE 100 in London down 0.6% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.6% CAC in Paris down 0.4% FTSE MiB in Milan down 0.9% Ibex in Madrid down 0.5% The unreliable boyfriend commits, says Anna Stupnytska, global economist at fund manager Fidelity International. Mark Carney\u2019s re-appointment brings continuity to BoE policy. Compared to almost any potential successor, Carney will exert a more firmly dovish influence on UK monetary decision-making, as he has done consistently since he took the helm in 2013. While Carney expects a gradual pace of rate hikes from here, perhaps little more than one per year, as he sees out the rest of his tenure, in reality he will be driven by how smooth or disruptive Brexit turns out to be. Indeed, it is perhaps with regards to Brexit where Carney-continuity is more important, and why Theresa May was so keen to keep him on board. In addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also supervises and regulates British banks through \u201cmacro-prudential\u201d policy. As such, investors can take some comfort that Carney is as well-placed as anyone to navigate any choppy waters that Brexit will bring to threaten Britain\u2019s overall financial system. Regarding the process for the appointment of Carney\u2019s successor, the chancellor wrote to the Bank of England governor: An extension of your term would ensure there is continuity at the Bank during this exceptional period and would also allow for a new governor to be appointed during the autumn next year after the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal and the framework for the future partnership have been finalised. The seven-month extension of Carney\u2019s term as Bank of England governor is shorter than some expected. He will stay on until the end of January 2020, which means he\u2019ll be at the central bank\u2019s helm during the withdrawal period (the UK is due to exit the EU at 11pm UK time on Friday 29 March, 2019). But he won\u2019t be there for the entire transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, welcomed the news, our political correspondent Peter Walker reports. He told reporters after Treasury questions in the Commons: I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney. We meet on a regular basis, and I have a lot of confidence in him. So I\u2019m pleased \u2013 this will give us a bit of stability. I wish we\u2019d have heard a bit sooner, but that\u2019s good. While refusing to say who he would prefer as a successor, McDonnell said he would like the new governor to be a woman: It would be useful if it was, actually. It\u2019s nice to get a better gender balance in these things. Nigel Farage, vice chairman of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, has a different response. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the influential Treasury select committee, is pleased. This announcement provides much-needed stability and clarity during this important period. The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury committee to scrutinise the appointment. The announcement comes after weeks of speculation as to whether Carney, the former governor of Canada\u2019s central bank, who took the Bank of England job in 2013, would agree to an extension of his term given the economic uncertainty over Brexit. You can read our full story here You can read the exchange of letters between Carney and Hammond here. In his letter, the chancellor said: Further to our discussions and those that I have had with the Prime Minister, I am writing to ask whether you would be able to extend your term as Governor of the Bank of England to January 2020 to support a smooth exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and an effective transition to the next Governor.\u201d In his reply, the Bank of England governor said: I recognise that during this critical period, it is important that everyone does everything they can to support a smooth and successful Brexit. Accordingly, I am willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England and I can confirm that I would be honoured to extend my term to January 2020.\u201d HM Treasury has also announced that Jon Cunliffe has been reappointed as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability for a second five-year term. Bradley Fried, Chair of the Bank\u2019s Court of Directors, said The Bank and its Court of Directors are delighted that Mark and Jon have agreed to stay on. Continuity in the outstanding leadership they provide will help the Bank succeed in our crucial work. News flash: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has agreed to stay until January 2020, the chancellor Philip Hammond has confirmed. The 10-year anniversary of the Lehman\u2019s collapse has prompted photographer Andy Hall to take to the streets of the City of London to see what\u2019s changed. The City from the street, a decade after the crash \u2013 in pictures Let\u2019s take another look at the markets. The pound has shed its initial gains and is now flat against the dollar and the euro, despite strong UK labour market data. Regular pay growth in July picked up to the fastest rate in three years, while job vacancies hit a record high and the unemployment rate remained at 4%, the lowest since 1975. Even so, average weekly wages are still lower than the levels achieved before the financial crisis in 2008, remaining \u00a331 below the pre-crisis average. European stocks are back in the red, after it emerged that China plans to ask the World Trade Organisation next week for permission to impose sanctions on the US, for Washington\u2019s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over US dumping duties. Reuters reported this, citing a meeting agenda. The request is likely to lead to years of legal wrangling over the case for sanctions and the amount. China initiated the dispute in 2013, complaining about U.S. dumping duties on several industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, with an annual export value of up to $8.4bn. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: This news immediately sparked fears that the next round of trade war-escalation isn\u2019t far off, sending the FTSE and DAX down 0.6% apiece. The Dow Jones is set to join them in the red once the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 70-ish point drop. That would leave the Dow the wrong side of 25,800 for the first time since the end of August, and in danger of falling further if Trump decides to announce his next set of tariffs on Chinese imports. FTSE 100 in London down 0.5% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.5% CAC in France down 0.2% FTSE MiB in Milan down 0.6% Ibex in Madrid down 0.4% Ten years ago this weekend US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed (the biggest corporate failure in history), causing panic on both sides of the Atlantic. A decade on, where are the key players in the financial crisis? Here\u2019s a bit more on the US banks\u2019 Brexit plans from Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who has been watching the Treasury select committee hearing with bank bosses from Barclays, Citi and JPMorgan this morning. JPMorgan\u2019s vice chair said his forecast of \u201cmodest\u201d job losses of 150 to 200 between now and Brexit Day was not inconsistent with comments by the bank\u2019s chairman Jamie Dimon that Brexit could impact 4,000 jobs. The numbers I mentioned are to do with the short term horizon to get us through to March and then what we call Day 2. We just don\u2019t know what is going to happen in the future. The evolution of our staff count will be very much a function of the ultimate deal that can be secured by the UK. There is clearly a scenario in which one does envisage that sort of outcome [4,000 job moves]. The German ZEW economic sentiment survey, also out this morning, improved moderately. The main index rose to -10.6 in September from -13.7 in August, but stayed at its third-lowest level since 2012. Professor Achim Wambach, president of the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim, said: During the survey period, the currency crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified, while German industrial production and incoming orders were surprisingly low in July. Despite these unfavourable circumstances, economic expectations for Germany improved slightly. The considerable fears displayed by the survey participants regarding the economic development have diminished somewhat, which may in part be attributable to the new trade agreement between the USA and Mexico. Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, said: This tells the ECB that eurozone growth is stabilising, but not accelerating back to last year\u2019s buoyant levels. However, the updated eurozone labour market data shows that wage growth is accelerating strongly, giving the green light to end QE at the end of 2018. Eurozone economic expectations in the ZEW survey rose to -7.2 from -11.1, while the assessment of the current business situation improved in Germany as well as the wider eurozone. Rakau said: That indicates that financial market participants\u2019 economic expectations continued to be bolstered by the preliminary EU-US trade deal, that took US car tariffs off the table for now. The latest news from on-going EU-US trade talks may already have help in that regard as well with the survey ending yesterday. Talks were described as \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cforward-looking\u201d. However, that may still change at the hand of one tweet, while US-China trade relations don\u2019t show similar encouraging tendencies. Meanwhile, emerging markets remain under pressure and global trade is slowing underlining why confidence levels remain well below last year\u2019s levels. Back to the UK labour market data. Alok Sharma, the employment minister, highlighted that the unemployment rate is the lowest since the mid-1970s while employment rate (which dipped today) remains near a record high, and that 1.45 million more children are living in a home with all adults in work. Sharma said: With unemployment rate still at its lowest level in 43 years, it is good to see that for the sixth month in a row wages have grown faster than inflation helping to put more money in people\u2019s pockets. In the last quarter regular pay is up by 2.9%, 0.5% above inflation.\u201d Households across the country are benefiting from the security of being in work, and with increasing wages and GDP growth of 0.6% last quarter we are delivering an economy that supports working people. Knight Frank\u2019s latest global house price index shows that the world\u2019s top hotspot is Malta. The Mediterranean island is leading the index for the first time with 17% annual house price growth, moving ahead of Hong Kong (16% growth). The report said a shortage of supply, combined with a robust economy (6.6% GDP growth in 2017) and a buoyant technology industry were pushing up demand. Only seven of the 57 countries tracked registered falling prices over the 12 months to June, namely Ukraine, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Italy, Finland and Israel. The UK is in 36th place, with 3% house price growth. The report says about Turkey: Turkey\u2019s travails mean that although prices are rising at an annual rate of 11%, according to the latest data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, when inflation of 16%+ is factored in, prices in real terms are now falling. More from Lisa O\u2019Carroll. JP Morgan vice chairman Mark Garvin brushed off Brexit staff disruption, saying the firm has seen more \u201ctumult\u201d in banking in his career. He told the Treasury select committee, chaired by Nicky Morgan, when being quizzed about cost of staff moves in Brexit contingency planning: We have been through far more tumult than this. This is an event we can very well manage. Staff know they live in a changing organisation. Compared to digitisation and other kinds of disruption this is not a massive challenge. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll has been watching the Treasury select committee this morning, where senior bankers have told MPs that they are moving \u201chundreds\u201d rather than thousands of staff out of London because of Brexit. She writes: But they have warned this is only the start of a process that could see more staff sucked out of the capital. Kevin Wall, the chief executive of Barclays Ireland said it was moving around 150 staff from London to Europe, most of these to Dublin. These are \u201csmall numbers\u201d in the context of the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d the banks employs in europe. James Bardrick, the head of Citi UK and CEO of Citigroup Global Markets, told the committee that it was also looking at moving around 150 staff, but that its planning for Brexit was \u201cmore about putting the right people in the right roles\u201d in various centres around Europe. Mark Garvin, vice chair of JP Morgan, said it was also moving jobs \u201cin the hundreds\u201d but told the committee that Brexit was \u201cnot a one-off big bang event\u201d and the \u201cscale and scope of these operations is going to be greatly increased as a result of transfer of operations to EU. The government\u2019s Chequers plan focused on an enhanced equivalence model for financial services rather than passporting or mutual recognition, the preferred option for many City firms. The EU has \u201cequivalence\u201d regimes which provide limited access for some non-EU countries to some areas of EU financial services markets. At present, banks and other financial firms based in London rely on an \u201cEU passport\u201d to operate freely across the EU\u2019s financial markets. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted some areas of concern, in particular the \u201calarmingly high\u201d number of job vacancies in Britain. The robust headline data masks several areas of concern. While there was a welcome increase in earnings growth, the gap between pay and price growth remains insufficient to convert into an appreciable pick-up in consumer spending. Sustaining meaningful real wage growth is likely to remain challenging amid subdued productivity and the escalating burden of upfront costs on businesses. The number of job vacancies in the UK remains at an alarmingly high level, further evidence of persistent skills shortages. While the number of people in work stands close to historic highs, firms continue to report that attempting to recruit staff with the right skills is an increasingly uphill struggle, which is stifling their ability to grow and boost productivity. It is vital that more is done to support those businesses looking to recruit and train staff, including delivering an open and flexible immigration system to help firms attract and retain the people they need to compete on the global stage. However, Julian Jessop, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs, tweeted: UK employment rose just 3,000 in the three months to July, taking the number of people in work to 32.397 million. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, was quick to respond to the labour market data. He says they suggest that competition for workers is finally starting to provide greater support to wages. The slowdown in total pay growth in May and June was reversed in July... Looking ahead, there is little sign that the recent slowdown in employment will prove permanent. Even the most pessimistic leading indicators point to employment growth of 1% y/y. Meanwhile, surveys of wage growth suggest that it will sustain a pace of about 3% y/y over the remainder of the year. Despite today\u2019s increase in wage growth, we still think that the MPC will hold off raising interest rates again until the near-term uncertainty due to the Brexit negotiations is resolved. You can see what wage growth has done over the past few years in this graph: So wage growth is faster than inflation, which is currently at 2.5%. Pay growth has picked up from the three months to June, when average earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.7% but rose just 2.4% when bonuses were included. Unemployment fell by 55,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to July from the previous three months. However, the employment rate \u2013 the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 years who were in work \u2013 edged down to 75.5% from 75.6%. The ONS\u2019s head of labour market statistics David Freeman said: With the number of people in work little changed, employment growth has weakened. However, the labour market remains robust, with the number of people working still at historically high levels, unemployment down on the year and a record number of vacancies. Meanwhile, earnings have grown faster than prices for several months, especially looking at pay excluding bonuses. News flash: UK pay growth has (finally) picked up, according to the Office for National Statistics, apparently as hiring tailed off. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.9% year-on-year in the three months to July, the fastest growth since March. In July alone, earnings were up 3.1%, the biggest increase since July 2015. Including bonuses, pay growth accelerated to 2.6% in the three months to July. The figures were stronger than City economists had expected. Job vacancies reached 833,000 in the three months to August, the highest number since records began in 2001. The unemployment rate stayed at 4%, as expected. Sterling rose as much as 0.4% to $1.3072 against the dollar in London trading this morning. Against the euro, it was more or less flat at 89.02 pence. EU leaders are expected to hold a special Brexit summit in mid-November where they hope to sign off a divorce deal. Back to the sterling rally, which was triggered by yet another hint from the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday that a Brexit deal was possible (similar to last week). Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, has this pithy comment: It may be a little undignified to have sterling\u2019s value depend on the lightest word of a French politician. He adds: In the interminably tedious process of extricating the EU from the UK single market, something stirs. The historian Rees-Mogg completely failed to come up with an alternative to the government\u2019s economic plan. This might strengthen Prime Minister May\u2019s position. And on the mooted second meeting between the US president and North Korea\u2019s leader, Donovan says: US President Trump is keen to meet North Korean leader Kim. This does not matter much. Markets worried about risks ahead of the last meeting. These risks have largely gone. Markets might possibly read Trump overlooking the apparent continuation of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program as a signal of disinterest that could be applied to the trade negotiation details. In corporate news, JD Sports Fashion\u2019s rapidly-growing international business has helped it ride out Britain\u2019s highstreet malaise. The sportswear chain posted pretax profits of \u00a3122m for the six months to 4 August, up 19%. JD, which has shops in countries from Finland to Malaysia, said like-for-like sales rose more than 3% despite \u201cwidely reported retail challenges in the UK\u201d. However this was due to strong online sales \u2013 like-for-like sales in stores were flat. Profits in JD\u2019s UK &amp; Ireland stores have improved, though, following investments made in linking its online operations and highstreet shops. Sterling has just hit a fresh five-week high of $1.3060, up 0.3%, following yesterday\u2019s comments from the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier that a Brexit deal was possible by November. The FTSE 100 index in London has slipped 0.2% on the firmer pound, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are up 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. The pound is up 0.2% against the dollar so far today. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, is in Strasbourg today, briefing MEPs. A growing number of companies are preparing for a no-deal outcome, just in case \u2013 several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Merck are stockpiling medicines in the event of a hard Brexit. The Times reports that Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, is stockpiling ingredients, chocolates and biscuits in case no deal is struck. Hubert Weber, president of Mondelez Europe, said: Like the whole of the food and drink industry in the UK, we would prefer a good deal that allows the free flow of products as that would have less of an impact to the UK consumer. However, we are also preparing for a hard Brexit and, from a buffering perspective for Mondelez, we are stocking higher levels of ingredients and finished products, although you can only do so much because of the shelf life of our products. We have a continency plan in place to manage [a hard Brexit], as the UK is not self-sufficient in terms of food ingredients, so that could be a challenge. He said he wished that Britain was \u201cat a different stage [in negotiations with the European Union] at this stage\u201d and hoped that a deal could be agreed by next year, otherwise British shoppers could face higher prices and fewer choices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Asia have been boosted by news that Donald Trump wants to hold another summit with Kim Jong-un, North Korean leader, raising hopes of greater political stability in the region. In the UK, sterling hit a 5-week high yesterday after the European Union\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal was possible \u201cwithin six or eight weeks\u201d if negotiators were realistic in their demands. The pound rose more than 1% to $1.3052 and later settled at $1.3021, up 0.8% on the day. It also hit a one-month high against the euro at 88.96 pence. It was the second time in less than a week that Barnier signalled he wanted to push ahead on the Brexit negotiations. He told a forum in Slovenia: If we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks. European stock markets are expected to extend yesterday\u2019s gains, when market relief over the Italian budget offset worries over trade tensions between the US and China. Trump could escalate the dispute if he acts on his threat to impose tariffs on a further $467bn of Chinese goods \u2013 which would cover all Chinese imports into the US. Beijing has said it would retaliate with duties on $60bn of US goods.

In addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also supervises and regulates British banks through \u201cmacro-prudential\u201d policy.

The main index rose to -10.6 in September from -13.7 in August, but stayed at its third-lowest level since 2012. </p> <p>Professor Achim Wambach, president of the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the survey period, the currency crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified, while German industrial production and incoming orders were surprisingly low in July. Despite these unfavourable circumstances, economic expectations for Germany improved slightly. The considerable fears displayed by the survey participants regarding the economic development have diminished somewhat, which may in part be attributable to the new trade agreement between the USA and Mexico. </p> </blockquote> <p>Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This tells the ECB that eurozone growth is stabilising, but not accelerating back to last year\u2019s buoyant levels. However, the updated eurozone labour market data shows that wage growth is accelerating strongly, giving the green light to end QE at the end of 2018.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eurozone economic expectations in the ZEW survey rose to -7.2 from -11.1, while the assessment of the current business situation improved in Germany as well as the wider eurozone. Rakau said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That indicates that financial market participants\u2019 economic expectations continued to be bolstered by the preliminary EU-US trade deal, that took US car tariffs off the table for now. The latest news from on-going EU-US trade talks may already have help in that regard as well with the survey ending yesterday. Talks were described as \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cforward-looking\u201d. </p> <p>However, that may still change at the hand of one tweet, while US-China trade relations don\u2019t show similar encouraging tendencies. Meanwhile, emerging markets remain under pressure and global trade is slowing underlining why confidence levels remain well below last year\u2019s levels.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0051b2a0f5a2f2b3e8c8503d63f9fb5d996b96dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0051b2a0f5a2f2b3e8c8503d63f9fb5d996b96dd/0_159_4783_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany\u2019s Volkswagen car company is displayed at the building of a company\u2019s retailer in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany\u2019s Volkswagen car company is displayed at the building of a company\u2019s retailer in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b978e54e4b0763859af5531\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-11T09:45:55.638Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the UK labour market data.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global demand for fossil fuels will peak in 2023, an influential thinktank has predicted, posing a significant risk to financial markets because trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil, coal and gas assets could be left worthless. Explosive growth in wind and solar will combine with action on climate change and slowing growth in energy needs to ensure that fossil fuel demand peaks in the 2020s, Carbon Tracker predicted. The projection is much more bullish than estimates by the global energy watchdog and oil and gas companies, which mostly expect demand to peak in the mid-2030s. Coal reached its peak in 2014. Kingsmill Bond, new energy strategist at Carbon Tracker, said: \u201cFossil fuel demand has been growing for 200 years, but is about to enter structural decline. Entire sectors will struggle to make this transition.\u201d The group, which popularised the notion of a carbon bubble \u2013 where fossil fuel assets lose their value in the switch to a low-carbon economy \u2013 said the findings spelled disruption for energy firms. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has already warned that markets face a \u201chuge hit\u201d from the transition. Carbon Tracker said financial markets faced a \u201csystemic risk\u201d from a reduction in value to the fossil fuel industry\u2019s $25tn (\u00a319tn) worth of assets, due to demand peaking. Countries such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which are overwhelmingly reliant on oil revenues, are also at risk from a fall in their tax take, the thinktank added. Oil and gas firms have rejected the idea that their assets are at risk, because their reserves do not remain underground for very long. BP said earlier this year that it pumps its entire hydrocarbon reserves about every 13 years. Others simply dismiss the idea that a peak is coming any time soon, with ExxonMobil, the world\u2019s biggest international oil company, projecting growth to 2040 as the world continues to rely on oil for heavy vehicles, shipping and aviation. The Carbon Tracker report warned incumbency and size would be no protection, and compared the fate of fossil fuel firms to the horse and cart at the start of the 20th century. \u201cDemand for incumbents peaks early, and investors in incumbents lose money early,\u201d it said. The first two decades of this century were the innovation period for renewables, the authors said, while the \u201cendgame\u201d for fossil fuels \u2013 when renewables overtake them \u2013 would come from 2050 onwards. The group\u2019s early peak in 2023 is due partly to bullish estimates of levels of electrification, such as transport switching from oil to batteries and electricity. Falling wind and solar costs would lead to some emerging countries \u201cleapfrogging\u201d fossil fuels and opting for renewables to meet most of their growing energy needs, the thinktank said. The group did not look at the likelihood or impact of the Paris climate agreement being weakened by other countries following the US and quitting, as one Brazilian presidential candidate has threatened. However, Sebastian Ljungwaldh, an energy analyst at Carbon Tracker, said: \u201cIf more and more countries start to take Paris less seriously, that will have some effect on how quickly the energy transition happens.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A green energy firm has claimed it is on track to become the largest challenger to the sector\u2019s big six before Christmas, despite raising prices for a third time this year. Bulb, which has focused on affordable renewable electricity and customer service, has attracted more than 750,000 customers, up from 70,000 a year ago. Hayden Wood, a former management consultant who co-founded the company with former Barclays energy trader Amit Gudka, said the firm was on a trajectory to overtake First Utility and Ovo within the next three months. First Utility has 825,000 customers and launched in 2008, while Ovo has 890,000 and started in 2009. Bulb was founded in 2015. The claim comes as the company announced a huge 11% price rise on Monday, citing rising wholesale costs. Wood said the speed of growth had surprised him and had been challenging at times. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard. We didn\u2019t think we would do this [so quickly] when Amit and I were raising money from friends and family in 2015.\u201d Robert Buckley, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said he did not think the price rise would harm the firm\u2019s growth. \u201cPrevious price rises have not stopped Bulb\u2019s growth. Given the general move up in prices, I\u2019d be surprised if this one did,\u201d he said. Wood said the secret to success had been to maintain customer service while rapidly expanding, a formula other startup suppliers have been unable to fulfil. Growth has been driven by word of mouth and a referral scheme that pays existing customers, \u2018members\u2019 in company parlance, \u00a350 to recruit new ones, who also get \u00a350. \u201cWe see no reason to stop this,\u201d said Wood, when asked if the referral fee was sustainable. The success has also prompted increased attention, including a recent report that the firm is gearing up for a sale. Wood rejected that claim, saying there is \u201cno possibility\u201d of a sale. He is sanguine about new threats posed to the firm\u2019s growth, from both ends of the market. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said, referring to the merger of npower and SSE, and oil and gas conglomerate Shell buying First Utility. At the smaller end of the sector, Wood said he was puzzled that new challenger firms were still launching with electricity tariffs that included fossil fuels. \u201cIt still really surprises me they have one green tariff and one brown tariff. Why wouldn\u2019t you just have something that your company stands for?\u201d It has not all been plain sailing for Bulb. The company was reprimanded by the energy regulator for being slow to offer prepayment meters and is now big enough that its price hikes this year made headlines. While focused on offering one green tariff to consumers, it is branching into new areas. Two key ones are business energy customers and exploring how to leverage the combination of solar power, Tesla-style household batteries and electric cars. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to start up some of those businesses. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be overnight,\u201d said Wood.",

      "body": "<p>A green energy firm has claimed it is on track to become the largest challenger to the sector\u2019s big six before Christmas, despite raising prices for a third time this year.</p> <p>Bulb, which has focused on affordable renewable electricity and customer service, has attracted more than 750,000 customers, up from 70,000 a year ago.</p> <p>Hayden Wood, a former management consultant who co-founded the company with former Barclays energy trader Amit Gudka, said the firm was on a trajectory to overtake First Utility and Ovo within the next three months.</p> <p>First Utility has 825,000 customers and launched in 2008, while Ovo has 890,000 and started in 2009. Bulb was founded in 2015.</p> <p>The claim comes as the company <a href=\"https://bulb.co.uk/blog/wholesale-energy-market-update-august\">announced a huge 11% price rise</a> on Monday, citing rising wholesale costs.</p> <p>Wood said the speed of growth had surprised him and had been challenging at times. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard. We didn\u2019t think we would do this [so quickly] when Amit and I were raising money from friends and family in 2015.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Buckley, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said he did not think the price rise would harm the firm\u2019s growth. \u201cPrevious price rises have not stopped Bulb\u2019s growth. Given the general move up in prices, I\u2019d be surprised if this one did,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wood said the secret to success had been to maintain customer service while rapidly expanding, <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/utilities/2014/11/first-utility-faces-customer-backlash-as-complaints-double\">a formula other startup suppliers have been unable to fulfil</a>.</p> <p>Growth has been driven by word of mouth and a referral scheme that pays existing customers, \u2018members\u2019 in company parlance, \u00a350 to recruit new ones, who also get \u00a350.</p> <p>\u201cWe see no reason to stop this,\u201d said Wood, when asked if the referral fee was sustainable.</p> <p>The success has also prompted increased attention, including <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/08/19/bulb-energy-goes-sale-could-fetch-500m/\">a recent report that the firm is gearing up for a sale</a>. Wood rejected that claim, saying there is \u201cno possibility\u201d of a sale.</p> <p>He is sanguine about new threats posed to the firm\u2019s growth, from both ends of the market. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/30/npower-sse-merger-wins-go-ahead-from-competition-watchdog\">merger of npower and SSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\">oil and gas </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility\">conglomerate Shell buying First Utility</a>.</p> <p>At the smaller end of the sector, Wood said he was puzzled that new challenger firms were still launching with electricity tariffs that included fossil fuels.</p> <p>\u201cIt still really surprises me they have one green tariff and one brown tariff. Why wouldn\u2019t you just have something that your company stands for?\u201d</p> <p>It has not all been plain sailing for Bulb. The company <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2018/08/retail_compliance_and_enforcement_report_13_august_2018_0.pdf\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2018/08/retail_compliance_and_enforcement_report_13_august_2018_0.pdf\">reprimanded by the energy regulator for being slow to offer prepayment meters</a> and is now big enough that its price hikes this year <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/bulb-energy-becomes-latest-provider-12683034\">made headlines</a>.</p> <p>While focused on offering one green tariff to consumers, it is branching into new areas. Two key ones are business energy customers and exploring how to leverage the combination of solar power, Tesla-style household batteries and electric cars.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to start up some of those businesses. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be overnight,\u201d said Wood.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago this weekend Lehman Brothers crashed into bankruptcy \u2013 the biggest corporate failure in history \u2013 and sent the world\u2019s financial system reeling close to collapse, causing panic among policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic. The US government was forced into a $700bn (\u00a3540bn) bailout of the banking sector, while in the UK, Lloyds Bank rescued HBOS and the government was then forced to rescue Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. A decade on, what has happened to the key players involved in the financial crisis and its aftermath? THE LEHMAN TWO Dick Fuld Then: Lehman Brothers chief executive Now: runs Matrix Private Capital, which offers investment advice to \u201chigh-net-worth\u201d clients Fuld ran Lehman for 14 years before the bank collapsed and was paid about $500m over the last eight years of that period. The man nicknamed \u201cthe gorilla\u201d has repeatedly blamed the government, regulators and unfounded rumours for Lehman\u2019s death while admitting few mistakes. The bank\u2019s staff, however, blamed the Gorilla and in a grilling on Capitol Hill a congressman described him as \u201cthe villain\u201d. In 2009 he sold an apartment in Manhattan for $25m and a collection of art for $13.5m but he still has a number of luxury properties dotted around the US. Now aged 72, Fuld has made a comeback as the head of New York-based Matrix Private Capital, and the \u201ckey wealth centres\u201d of Los Angeles and Palm Beach in Florida. In a rare public appearance in 2015 he said: \u201cWhatever it is, enjoy the ride. No regrets.\u201d Erin Callan Then: ousted Lehman chief financial officer Now: retired A former lawyer, Callan had a meteoric Wall Street career, joining the bank in 1995 and becoming its finance chief in late 2007. For a while her super-positive style helped reassure investors but Fuld fired her two months before the bankruptcy. Callan was widely criticised in the aftermath of the collapse for being underqualified to run the finances of a major investment bank as she did not have even basic accounting qualificiations. She was slammed in a bankruptcy court report for ignoring \u201cample red flags\u201d and using misleading gimmicks to bolster Lehman\u2019s balance sheet by $50bn. Callan worked briefly for Credit Suisse before going on leave and not returning. In her self-published 2016 memoir, Full Circle, Callan revealed she took an overdose of sleeping pills in December 2008. In the book she said she regretted putting her career before personal relationships. Aged 52, she now lives in New York and Florida with her retired firefighter husband and daughter. THE US OFFICIALS Ben Bernanke Then: chairman of the US Federal Reserve Now: adviser to the vast Pimco investment business and the $30bn Citadel hedge fund \u2013 and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution Bernanke missed the warning signs of the looming financial crisis but, a student of the Great Depression, he acted decisively after Lehman\u2019s failure. He led the Fed in cutting interest rates to zero and, in concert with other central banks, launched quantitative easing to pump electronic money into the economy in a bid to prevent the worst recession of the postwar era turning into a second great depression. Since leaving the Fed in 2014 Bernanke has been a visiting fellowat the Brookings Institution thinktank. Now 64, he is also an adviser to Pimco, the giant US bond fund, and Citadel, a hedge fund \u2013 appointments he has acknowledged raise concerns about the revolving door between the Fed and the financial sector. Henry \u201cHank\u201d Paulson Then: US Treasury secretary Now: chairman of University of Chicago\u2019s Paulson Institute As Lehman descended towards bankruptcy, Paulson was adamant the bank should not be rescued. Stung by criticism of the Treasury\u2019s support for other failing financial companies, Paulson said he did not want to be seen as \u201cMr Bailout\u201d. Paulson, the former boss of Goldman Sachs, was already wealthy when he became a public servant. After leaving the Treasury in 2009 he founded the Paulson Institute, which supports sustainable growth and US-China investment, and the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, a forum for luminaries to discuss the US economy. Paulson has been a severe critic of Trump. Before the 2016 US election he penned an excoriating attack for the Washington Post, saying Trump represented \u201ca brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism\u201d. He also questioned Trump\u2019s business acumen and accused the billionaire of flaunting and exaggerating his wealth. In July, at an event with Bernanke and Tim Geithner, Paulson also warned of the dangers of watering down new laws designed to prevent another banking crisis \u2013 notably the Dodd-Frank law passed after the financial crisis to tighten regulation on big \u201csytemically-important\u201d banks. \u201cIt is important that people focus on the lessons,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cWe are not sure people remember everything they need to remember.\u201d Tim Geithner Then: president of the New York Federal Reserve Now: president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus As boss of the New York Fed, Geithner was another of the officials who decided to let Lehman collapse, although he has since criticised Paulson for revealing the plan to senior bankers in advance. When Barack Obama was elected in November 2008 Geithner was appointed Treasury secretary. In four years at the Treasury Geithner was criticised for being too close to Wall Street and for targeting deficit reduction over cutting unemployment. Geithner, 57, now holds an array of top jobs, including president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, visiting lecturer at Yale University and board member of International Rescue Committee, the humanitarian relief organisation. THE UK POLITICIANS Gordon Brown Then: prime minister Now: UN special envoy for global eductation In 2004, as chancellor, Brown lavished praise on Lehman Brothers at the opening of the bank\u2019s new headquarters in London. He also advocated \u201clight touch\u201d regulation for the City. However, when Lehman went down, Brown ordered a bank rescue that became a model for shoring up financial systems. Now 67, Brown is the UN\u2019s special envoy for global education and campaigns on child poverty. Like Bernanke he is an adviser to Pimco but Brown says he makes no money from private sector work, using it to pay for his staff, with the rest going to charity. He occasionally steps into UK politics, campaigning against Scottish independence in 2014 and calling for an end to Labour\u2019s antisemitism controversy. Alistair Darling Then: chancellor of the exchequer Now: director of Morgan Stanley Darling vetoed Barclays\u2019 attempt to buy Lehman just before it went bust \u2013 although he denies telling Paulson he was \u201cnot going to import your cancer\u201d. Now 64, has said the scariest moment of the crisis was when Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s chairman told him the bank was about to run out of money. After standing down as an MP in 2015 Darling became a life peer and joined the board of Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. He led the campaign against Scottish independence in 2014, a decision critics said weakened Labour in Scotland. He is also a president of the Chatham House thinktank. Shriti Vadera Then: business minister Now: chair of Santander UK Vadera, one of Gordon Brown\u2019s closest advisers, helped push through the post-Lehman banking bailout. Reflecting on that time, the life peer has said Lehman set off events that seemed uncontrollable. Since leaving the government she has become one of the most powerful women in the City. As well as chairing Santander\u2019s UK business she is a director of FTSE 100 companies BHP Billiton and AstraZeneca and has other advisory roles. Vadera, who is 56, has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England but an abrasive style could weigh against her. THE BANK GOVERNOR Mervyn King Then: Bank of England governor Now: academic and adviser to Citigroup King was accused of reacting slowly to the financial crisis at first but Lehman changed all that. After supporting the October 2008 UK bank bailout the Bank under King slashed interest rates close to zero and was part of a coordinated response to introduce quantitative easing to shore up the economy. King, now 70, retired from the Bank in 2013 and became a life peer. The Aston Villa fan had a two-month stint on the football club\u2019s board in 2016. King is a professor at the London School of Economics and New York University and a trustee of the National Gallery. Surprisingly for a fierce critic of banks, he is also an adviser to Citigroup. He has been relatively upbeat about Brexit but last week said the government\u2019s preparations were incompetent. THE MAN WHO MADE $1bn Steve Eisman Then: fund manager at FrontPoint Partners Now: fund manager at Neuberger Berman When Lehman collapsed it sparked the market rout Eisman had been waiting for \u2013 and betting on. The maverick investor made $1bn betting against the banks, including Lehman, and the bundled up mortgage bonds on their balance sheets. His story was turned into a book, The Big Short, and then a film of the same name in which his character was played by Steve Carell. Eisman, 56, has not repeated his spectacular success but his views continue to attract attention. Recently he has warned that cryptocurrencies have no purpose and has placed bets against the Canadian housing market, US car loans and Tesla, the electric carmaker. THE BRITISH BANK BOSSES Fred Goodwin Then: chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Now: retired The government spent \u00a345bn rescuing RBS after Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy and Goodwin became a symbol of all that was wrong in banking. In 2012 he was stripped of his knighthood and a stint as an adviser to a firm of architects came to an end less than a year after his appointment. Goodwin, however, kept his multimillion-pound bonuses from RBS and receives a \u00a3350,000-a-year pension from the bank. Aged 60, he continues to circulate among sections of Edinburgh\u2019s elite. Eric Daniels Then: chief executive of Lloyds TSB Now: director of Funding Circle When Lloyds rescued HBOS after the Lehman collapse, Daniels, a US banker, presented the deal as a unique chance for Lloyds to dominate retail banking. In the event the losses Daniels had expected from the HBOS deal were a huge underestimate. He left Lloyds in 2011 with a \u00a35m pension pot and won a case against Lloyds, reclaiming a withheld bonus of up to \u00a31.4m. Now 67, Daniels has racked up an array of advisory jobs and directorships, including at Funding Circle, a platform that links those with money to lend to small business needing to borrow. Last week it announced plans to float on the London stock exchange. His stake in the business could be worth some \u00a33m. Andy Hornby Then: chief executive of HBOS Now: joint chief operating officer of GVC Holdings Hornby was a whiz-kid of British business who was a high-flyer at Asda before becoming a senior executive at the Halifax aged only 32. By the time he was 39 he was chief executive of HBOS \u2013 but two years later, after the Lehman collapse, the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds. In 2013 the Banking Standards Commission judged that Hornby, along with two other HBOS bosses, had been guilty of a \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d. Only a year after the HBOS crisis, however, Hornby was back in business, as the \u00a31m-a-year chief executive of health and beauty business Alliance Boots, and in 2011 he was appointed the boss of Coral, the bookmaker. Coral is now owned by publicly traded GVC but Hornby is not on the main board and stays out of the limelight. He is also chairman of an online pharmacy business. Now 51, Hornby, could still face action by the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 the financial industry watchdog \u2013 over the bank\u2019s failure.",

However, when Lehman went down, Brown ordered a bank rescue that became a model for shoring up financial systems.</p> <p>Now 67, Brown is the UN\u2019s special envoy for global education and campaigns on child poverty. Like Bernanke he is an adviser to Pimco but Brown says he makes no money from private sector work, using it to pay for his staff, with the rest going to charity. He occasionally steps into UK politics, campaigning against Scottish independence in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/02/gordon-brown-labour-ihra-antisemitism-definition-nec-vote\">calling for an end to Labour\u2019s antisemitism controversy</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Alistair Darling</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>chancellor of the exchequer<br><strong>Now: </strong>director of Morgan Stanley</p> <p>Darling vetoed Barclays\u2019 attempt to buy Lehman just before it went bust \u2013 although he denies telling Paulson he was \u201cnot going to import your cancer\u201d.</p> <p>Now 64, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/feb/23/alistair-darling-interview-eurozone-crisis\">said the scariest moment of the crisis was when Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s chairman told him the bank was about to run out of money</a>. After standing down as an MP in 2015 Darling became a life peer and joined the board of Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. He led the campaign against Scottish independence in 2014, a decision critics said weakened Labour in Scotland. He is also a president of the Chatham House thinktank.</p> <h2><strong>Shriti Vadera</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>business minister<br><strong>Now: </strong>chair of Santander UK</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"095d98fc12829466c7bca8dc8240093f6c6dc87a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/095d98fc12829466c7bca8dc8240093f6c6dc87a/250_187_1667_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could Shriti Vadera be a future governor of the Bank of England?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vadera, one of Gordon Brown\u2019s closest advisers, helped push through the post-Lehman banking bailout. Reflecting on that time, the life peer has said Lehman set off events that seemed uncontrollable. Since leaving the government she has become one of the most powerful women in the City. As well as chairing Santander\u2019s UK business she is a director of FTSE 100 companies BHP Billiton and AstraZeneca and has other advisory roles. Vadera, who is 56, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/23/candidates-next-governor-bank-of-england\">has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England</a> but an abrasive style could weigh against her.</p> <h2><strong>THE BANK GOVERNOR</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Mervyn King</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>Bank of England governor<br><strong>Now: </strong>academic and adviser to Citigroup</p> <p>King was accused of reacting slowly to the financial crisis at first but Lehman changed all that. After supporting the October 2008 UK bank bailout the Bank under King slashed interest rates close to zero and was part of a coordinated response to introduce quantitative easing to shore up the economy.</p> <p>King, now 70, retired from the Bank in 2013 and became a life peer. The Aston Villa fan had a two-month stint on the football club\u2019s board in 2016. King is a professor at the London School of Economics and New York University and a trustee of the National Gallery. Surprisingly for a fierce critic of banks, he is also an adviser to Citigroup. He has been relatively upbeat about Brexit but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/05/brexit-mervyn-king-blasts-incompetence-of-preparations\">last week said the government\u2019s preparations were incompetent</a>.</p> <h2><strong>THE MAN WHO MADE $1bn</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Steve Eisman</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>fund manager at FrontPoint Partners<br><strong>Now: </strong>fund manager at Neuberger Berman</p> <p>When Lehman collapsed it sparked the market rout Eisman had been waiting for \u2013 and betting on. The maverick investor made $1bn betting against the banks, including Lehman, and the bundled up mortgage bonds on their balance sheets. His story was turned into a book, The Big Short, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/27/the-big-short-financially-accurate-adam-mckay-subprime-money-bale-gosling-pitt\">and then a film of the same name in which his character was played by Steve Carell</a>. Eisman, 56, has not repeated his spectacular success but his views continue to attract attention. Recently he has warned that cryptocurrencies have no purpose and has placed bets against the Canadian housing market, US car loans and Tesla, the electric carmaker.</p> <h2><strong>THE BRITISH BANK BOSSES</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Fred Goodwin</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland<br><strong>Now: </strong>retired</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf36f043d4b5bd7e0a6ae01875db00578c7536f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf36f043d4b5bd7e0a6ae01875db00578c7536f/10_4_2366_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Goodwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Goodwin receives a \u00a3350,000-a-year pension from RBS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government spent \u00a345bn rescuing RBS after Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy and Goodwin became a symbol of all that was wrong in banking. In 2012 he was stripped of his knighthood and a stint as an adviser to a firm of architects came to an end less than a year after his appointment. Goodwin, however, kept his multimillion-pound bonuses from RBS and receives a \u00a3350,000-a-year pension from the bank. Aged 60, he continues to circulate among sections of Edinburgh\u2019s elite.</p> <h2><strong>Eric Daniels</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>chief executive of Lloyds TSB<br><strong>Now: </strong>director of Funding Circle</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/09/have-the-too-big-to-fail-banks-really-met-their-waterloo\">Have the 'too big to fail' banks really met their Waterloo? | Richard Partington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Lloyds rescued HBOS after the Lehman collapse, Daniels, a US banker, presented the deal as a unique chance for Lloyds to dominate retail banking. In the event the losses Daniels had expected from the HBOS deal were a huge underestimate.</p> <p>He left Lloyds in 2011 with a \u00a35m pension pot and won a case against Lloyds, reclaiming a withheld bonus of up to \u00a31.4m. Now 67, Daniels has racked up an array of advisory jobs and directorships, including at Funding Circle, a platform that links those with money to lend to small business needing to borrow. Last week it announced plans to float on the London stock exchange. His stake in the business could be worth some \u00a33m.</p> <h2><strong>Andy Hornby</strong></h2> <p><strong>Then: </strong>chief executive of HBOS<br><strong>Now: </strong>joint chief operating officer of GVC Holdings</p> <p>Hornby was a whiz-kid of British business who was a high-flyer at Asda before becoming a senior executive at the Halifax aged only 32. By the time he was 39 he was chief executive of HBOS \u2013 but two years later, after the Lehman collapse, the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds. In 2013 the Banking Standards Commission judged that Hornby, along with two other HBOS bosses, had been guilty of a \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Only a year after the HBOS crisis Hornby was back in business</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only a year after the HBOS crisis, however, Hornby was back in business, as the \u00a31m-a-year chief executive of health and beauty business Alliance Boots, and in 2011 he was appointed the boss of Coral, the bookmaker. Coral is now owned by publicly traded GVC but Hornby is not on the main board and stays out of the limelight. He is also chairman of an online pharmacy business.</p> <p>Now 51, Hornby, could still face action by the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 the financial industry watchdog \u2013 over the bank\u2019s failure.</p>",
