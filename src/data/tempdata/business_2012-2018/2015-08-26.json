      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is to give 137,000 shopfloor staff a 4% pay rise, their biggest increase in a decade, after pressure from low pay campaigners. The supermarket said its standard rate of pay for store workers would go up from \u00a37.08 to \u00a37.36 an hour from next week. It remains below the level living wage campaigners have called for, but will be above George Osborne\u2019s \u00a37.20 national living wage, a new minimum for over 25s that comes into force next April. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would not differentiate between over and under 25s in its workforce, meaning 40,000 younger store staff will receive the new wage. The only exception will be for the 1,500-2,000 staff under 18 who receive a lower training wage during their first six months in the business. The 4% rise will only go to regular store staff. Sainsbury\u2019s declined to comment on its plans for the 24,000 non-store staff and store managers. The trade union Usdaw said it would continue to negotiate on behalf of those who missed out, but Joanne McGuinness, a national officer at Usdaw, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the company has listened to us, as significant increases in retail pay are long overdue.\u201d The move was welcomed by Gillian Owen of Citizens UK, one of the groups that has been putting pressure on major retailers to pay the independently evaluated living wage of \u00a37.85 across the UK and \u00a39.15 in London. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant step. We welcome it and encourage Sainsbury\u2019s to continue to look at how it could implement a living wage as and when possible in its business. We know it is leading in its sector and particularly welcome the fact Sainsbury\u2019s is including all staff in this wage rise, regardless of age.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s was one of a string of retailers to face questions at annual shareholder meetings about low staff pay from campaigners at Share Action and Citizens UK. They highlighted the fact that shop workers are potentially receiving billions of pounds of in-work benefits from the government because their rate of pay is too low to live on. The focus on pay has already resulted in the Co-operative handing shopfloor staff an 8% pay rise this year so they will earn \u00a37.28 an hour from October and \u00a37.30 an hour from next year. At the annual meeting, Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, told campaigners he was personally committed to doing a better job on workers\u2019 pay. After announcing the pay rise on Wednesday, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to thousands of colleagues over the past year and they tell me how much they value their package of benefits and the flexibility that we can offer as an employer, as well as hourly pay that has always been well over the minimum wage. Their hard work, talent and dedication have been central to our success and will remain so in the future.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is already the best payer of the big four supermarkets. Tesco pays more per hour, but does not remunerate staff during their break. Other benefits for Sainsbury\u2019s staff include life insurance, a discount card and an annual bonus. This year, 133,000 staff shared a bonus pot of \u00a350m. The chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cAt Budget I announced a new settlement for the British people, one that will create a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare economy backed by a new National Living Wage. Britain deserves a pay rise and today\u2019s announcement from Sainsbury\u2019s that from September they will pay their hardworking staff at least the National Living Wage, is fantastic news and a real vote of confidence in the UK economy.\u201d How the supermarkets compare on pay Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a37.36, paid breaks, 10% staff discount and annual bonus Tesco \u00a37.39, no paid breaks, 10% staff discount Asda \u00a36.89 (rising to \u00a37 from October), paid breaks, 10% staff discount and annual bonus Morrisons \u00a36.83, paid breaks, 10% staff discount and annual bonus Waitrose \u00a36.92, paid breaks, 15% staff discount and profit share bonus (11% of salary last year) The Co-operative \u00a36.73 (rising to \u00a37.28 from October), paid breaks, 10% staff discount on food Iceland \u00a37.12, no paid breaks, 10% staff discount (20% at Christmas) Marks &amp; Spencer \u00a37.41, no paid breaks, 20% staff discount and annual bonus Aldi \u00a37.25, paid breaks, no staff discount Lidl \u00a37.30, no paid breaks, 10% staff discount",

      "bodyText": "Walmart will no longer stock AR-15 rifles and other semi-automatic weapons, saying the decision is because of less demand from customers and not continued political pressure in the wake of several mass shootings in the US. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot of demand for those products so we replaced them with products we have seen customers coming into purchase it,\u201d Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told Fortune on Wednesday. The company says it made the decision earlier this year and will carry out the change as stores prepare for fall merchandise. They will replace the rifles, which are carried in less than a third of their stores, with shotguns and other hunting weapons. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, modern sporting rifles are among the most popular firearms sold in the US. Walmart and the AR-15 have been at the center of the gun control debate following continued mass shootings. The Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012 was carried out with a Bushmaster rifle modeled on the AR-15; and the 2012 Colorado theatre shooting was carried out with Smith and Wesson\u2019s version of the AR-15. Last year, police in Beavercreek, Ohio, shot dead John Crawford III, who was carrying an unloaded air rifle that was for sale in the store. Following the killing of six people during the attempted shooting of US representative Gabrielle Giffords, authorities said the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, purchased his ammunition at a Walmart store that morning. Gun control groups have said the company makes weapons too easily accessible. In 2008, the company agreed to stricter gun sale policies with the coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns, but Walmart expanded sales of rifles, shotguns and ammunition two years later, according to the Wall Street Journal. Despite initially declining an invitation to Obama\u2019s ongoing talks about guns and gun control, Walmart representatives met with attorney general Eric Holder to discuss gun policy in 2013. But the removal of semi-automatic weapons from stores is entirely because of diminished interest in the products, according to Walmart. \u201cThis happens to get more attention because of what the product is,\u201d Lundberg told Quartz. \u201cThe decision was completely based on what customers are buying and what they want.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The Dow leaps 619 points after two days of China woes - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was a long day of erratic trading in US markets today, with a rapid liftoff just after the bell and a close that marked biggest single-day gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 since 2011. Federal Reserve policymaker William Dudley walked back hints that an interest rate hike was imminent, calling the increase a safer bet for October than September, as previously indicated by Janet Yellen. Still no respite from the falloff in Shanghai: that market closed down 1.3% today, making it the fifth consecutive session down for the Shanghai Composite. Chinese police also arrested two traders today on charges of insider trading and faking documents. This liveblog is ending for the day, but read my colleagues Rupert Neate and Dominic Rushe on the closing bell, and come back to the Guardian\u2019s business section for our markets blog tomorrow. The Dow surged to a high of 627 points and closed at 619 up after a frantic day of ups and downs - that makes today the third-highest increase (in points, not percentage) in its history. Both of the others happened early in the financial crisis. Dow - 16,285.51, up 619.07 points (3.96%) S&amp;P 500 - 1,940.51, up 72.90 points (3.90%) NASDAQ - 4,697.54, up 191.05 points (4.24%) The Dow is up more than 500 points, because truly, for absolute certain, nobody has any idea what\u2019s going on. Provided 3:00 to 4:00 today looks different from the same time period yesterday, we\u2019re on track for the Dow to close up 400 points. An hour shy of the bell, the standings are solid across three major indexes. Dow: 16,069.27, up 402.83 (2.57%) S&amp;P 500: 1,913.48, up 45.87 (2.46%) Nasdaq: 4,628.34, up 121.85 (2.70%) Uniquely unworried in all the market hubbub is seed fund Ycombinator. The company just released a slew of statistics about its investments - all private concerns with cash from Ycombinator and other investors giving them a boost - including that its 940 companies had raised some $7bn by themselves. Chief Operations Officer Qasar Younis said the fund had just had its \u201cdemo day,\u201d during which some 500 investors check out its constituents. Younis didn\u2019t think the current trouble in China would cause too much trouble for the startup world - \u201cI think the economy\u2019s strong, rates are healthy, housing stats are good,\u201d he said (durable goods beat predictions by a health margin earlier today). But he did believe a longer fall could cause trouble. \u201cIf there\u2019s a much longer and prolonged downturn, it\u2019ll have a much stronger impact,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be much more cognizant of your cash.\u201d That\u2019s not a new thing, of course: \u201c2010, 2012 were a great time to be raising money,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you still had to be careful of your cash.\u201d Younis also had advice for startups that had to continuously raise money to remain operational: don\u2019t do that. You should never be beholden to investor capital. The easiest way to control your company is to be a profitable, stand-alone business. Chasing deals isn\u2019t a sustainable business strategy. Even in good times, the advice is the same: manage your cash. The Dow is now up 335 points at 2:15 p.m., good but not quite at its highest point for the day. The market is anxious to avoid a seven-day losing streak but yesterday and Monday both had ups and downs before stocks finally came crashing back to their starting positions (and below) at the closing bell. A couple of commodities charts giving perspective over the last few months, since the selloff in that sector is a large part of today\u2019s news (and news of the past week). Gold: Oil: As the market rallies, companies associated with commodities are on the way down: Barrick Gold, a mining concern, had an incredible peak during the financial crisis and recently now lost all those gains and more. Here\u2019s an interesting one from Doug Short: a graph of the S&amp;P 500 starting Oct. 9, 2007, at the beginning of the financial crisis and continuing through the present day. The index is down 9.29% for the year thus far, but this most recent dip is the second-deepest of the recovery so far. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our latest news story on today\u2019s developments: Sam Thielman in New York taking over the liveblog from Graeme - it\u2019s a grim day in New York as news of a grisly murder in Virginia dominates headlines coverage. The Dow took off early this morning but has zigged and zagged downward toward its opening price. There\u2019s another scuttled deal after yesterday\u2019s no-go notice for the Pepco-Exelon merger, but this one is good for at least one party: Monsanto has said it\u2019s not going to continue to pursue the acquisition of Swiss company Syngenta and is trading up on the news. Meanwhile, oil has dropped below $40 a barrel on a combination of worries about China and near-record Opec production; Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James tells Yahoo News that the reasons aren\u2019t \u201cfundamental.\u201d What a dramatic week it\u2019s been already: Could we get Turnaround Thursday tomorrow? Or Troubling Thursday, perhaps.... \u00a326bn was knocked off the value of the FTSE 100 companies today, calculates Sky News. Today\u2019s selloff pushes the FTSE 100 deeper into correction territory. It\u2019s currently 15% off its record high. European stock markets have just posted chunky falls, in a late selloff that suggests investors on this side of the Atlantic remain anxious. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares fell by 102 points to close at 5979, back below the 6,000 point mark. It has now fallen for 11 of the last 12 days (yesterday it jumped by 188 points) Silver producer Fresnillo led the selloff, down 7%: Germany\u2019s DAX and Spain\u2019s IBEX both lost 1.3%, and the French CAC dropped 1.4%. The markets had briefly turned positive earlier today, after the People\u2019s Bank of China offered more cheap loans to the financial sector. The feel-good factor didn\u2019t last long, though. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains why: The source of the rebound on Wednesday was a move by the People\u2019s Bank of China to inject 140bn yuan ($21.8bn) into the economy, a day after cutting interest rates and bank reserve ratios. It\u2019s clearly a positive that Chinese authorities have woken up to the problem at hand, it\u2019s just a bit of a worry it took them this long. Rather than getting ahead of the game with a well thought out plan for stabilising the economy, the People\u2019s Bank of China appears to be reluctantly easing policy any time there\u2019s a drop in share prices. The net effect is that markets clamour for more stimulus while at the same time losing faith it will actually work. City pros talk about \u2018Dr Copper\u2019, because the metal\u2019s price is seen as a good indicator of the health of the global economy. This chart, from Royal Bank of Scotland, suggests the patient is ailing: Our rivals at the Financial Times in London have spotted a rainbow over the City. There aren\u2019t many pots of gold on offer in the equity market tonight, though, with the FTSE down around 1.2% in late trading. William Dudley\u2019s comments on a September rate hike are significant, as he had previously been one of the FOMC members pushing for a rate raise. Here\u2019s the key quote from today\u2019s press conference: \u201cFrom my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalisation process at the September FOMC process seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago.\u201d The former CEO of bond giant Pimco, Mohamed El-Erian, got the message: The current stock market turmoil did not start in the US, Dudley adds, but doesn\u2019t go into much detail: Bingo! Federal Reserve policymaker William Dudley has just declared that a September interest rate hike is less likely. Dudley told his audience in New York said that recent data has been \u201cpretty positive\u201d, but international developments (hello, China) have raised the downside risks. As such, as September rate hike is \u201cless compelling\u201d, says Dudley. He added that it\u2019s important not to overreact to recent moves, though. After an hour of trading, the Wall Street rally has lost a little of its fizz. The Dow Jones is bobbing around the 15,950 mark, a gain of around 300 points. That\u2019s not a particularly strong position, given the recent sharp losses: William Dudley, president of Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is giving a speech now, but he\u2019s avoiding saying anything too controversial. Traders had been looking for guidance on possible rate hikes, or the China crisis. But instead, Dudley\u2019s prepared speech sticks to New York issues. However, there\u2019s a Q&amp;A coming up, so Dudley yet cough up an interesting quote.... Having watched yesterday\u2019s volatility, our US business editor Dominic Rushe fears that today\u2019s rally may not last until the closing bell. Here\u2019s his early take. Every share on the Dow is up in early trading. Pharmaceutical company Merck is fastest out of the blocks, gaining 4.4% [having been the biggest faller yesterday]. Tech giant Apple is close behind -- it\u2019s obviously exposed to weakness in the Chinese economy. Nike is enjoying an early bounce too. The rally is on! For the second day day running, Wall Street has surged at the start of trading. The Dow Jones is up by 430 points, or 2.7%, in an early burst of optimism. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a broader, wider range of US companies, is up 2.5%. But can the rally hold? It couldn\u2019t yesterday....... US stocks are rising, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 350 points, or 2.3%, in the first two minutes of trading. It\u2019s still climbing too..... The Wall Street bell is being rung, and trading gets underway in New York..... New York authorities have invoked \u2018Rule 48\u2019, a regulation designed to help the market open smoothly when volatility is high. Even if Wall Street does rally this morning, traders will surely be anxious after yesterday\u2019s late selloff. That saw the Dow leap by 3%, only to finish down 1.3% by the closing bell. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, tells Reuters: \u201cThese type of swings are typical when the market behaves in a way that is a real test of nerves and there is a lot ofongoing uncertainty.\u201d Hold onto your hats, we\u2019re getting some decent economic news out of America. Orders for durable goods (long-lasting manufactured goods) spiked by 2% in July, surprising economists who had expected a 0.4% decline. And that could mean the Dow Jones industrial average posts a stronger rally in an hour\u2019s time. New York traders are preparing for a surge of buying when the market opens, in an hour\u2019s time. The prospect of more central bank easing has had a predictably uplifting effect on European markets. The euro has fallen by 1% since ECB chief economist Peter Praet hinted that it could take fresh action to fight deflation. It has hit $1.1404, down from $1.151 last night. And shares are bouncing back from their lowest points. The FTSE 100 is now down 24 points, or 0.4%, after suffering a triple-digit slump this morning. Here\u2019s the situation across Europe, as traders grab a quick lunch (City workers should take an umbrella to the sandwich shop) This is rather neat - a timeline showing how the Shanghai composite index soared then tanked this year, and the actions that Beijing policymakers took along the way: The European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist just dropped a loud hint that it could take fresh action to stimulate Europe\u2019s economy. Falling commodity prices, and signs of economic weakness, mean there is a greater risk that Europe misses its inflation targets, Peter Praet told journalists in Mannheim, Germany. If so, the ECB would act, he insisted. Here\u2019s Praet\u2019s comments, via Reuters: \u201cDevelopments in the world economy and commodity markets have increased the downside risk in achieving the sustainable inflation path towards 2 percent; the risk has increased. \u201cThe governing council will closely monitor all incoming information,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be no ambiguity on the willingness and ability of the governing council to act if needed.\u201d This chart shows how market\u2019s expectations for eurozone inflation have fallen; that will concern the ECB. Could that mean more quantitative easing, on top of the \u20ac60bn per month already being pumped in? Possibly. Time for a recap. World stock markets are enduring another volatile day, with fresh losses in China and across Europe. The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has shed 82 points, or 1.3%, so far today, to 6000 points as rain lashes the windows of trading floors in the City. Other European stocks are also weakening, having posted their biggest jump in four years yesterday. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 1.5%. The Shanghai composite hit its lowest level since last December, after an early rally fizzled out. Investors in China remain jittery, despite Tuesday\u2019s interest rate cute. The People\u2019s Bank of China has taken fresh action today, by pumping another 140bn yuan into the interbank money market system. That has provided some comfort for investors, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: Whilst it may be a case of the central bank using a pack of plasters when surgery is needed, investors appeared to react more positively to the news than they have done to other inventions by the PBOC in the past fortnight. It means the FTSE has tentatively climbed past the 6000 mark, with the DAX sporadically re-crossing the 10000 level. Wall Street is expected to bounce back, after a late plunge last night: After Black Monday, and Turnaround Tuesday, Wednesday is proving a little less dramatic. Japan\u2019s stock market even rallied, ending up over 3%. Advertising magnate Sir Martin Sorrell has thrown his weight behind China, saying he remains a \u2018raging bull\u2019 on its long-term prospects. And Chinese authorities have begun investigating a journalist, having arrested two officials. It shows that the \u201csearch for scapegoats\u201d is underway, says Bloomberg: Sir Martin Sorrell isn\u2019t the only one feeling bullish about China, despite the current market rout. William Fong of Baring Asset Management agrees that the country\u2019s long-term growth prospects are still rosy: We like companies aligned with government policy as the process of urbanisation and improving China\u2019s environment continues. We also like beneficiaries of rising consumption and technological outfitting as companies move along the value chain, as well as \u201cNew China\u201d brands, able to compete with the biggest names. Everyone knows about Tencent and Lenovo, but we think the future is bright for companies such as Geely Automobile, a Chinese car maker able to sell in the EU, and Provence-style body and skincare brand L\u2019Occitane, which has international as well as domestic exposure. Photographers were lining up to capture today\u2019s 1.5% fall on the Hong Kong stock market: Despite the losses in China, and Europe, the US stock market is tipped to jump by more than 1% when trading begins in four hours time. But don\u2019t put your last fiver on it, given the way the Dow Jones flopped in late trading last night. Britain would be less badly hit than other advanced economies if China\u2019s economy weakens sharply. So argues Oxford Economics, anyway. Here\u2019s their logic: As a key player in the global economy and an increasingly important market for UK exports, a prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy would hit the UK\u2019s growth prospects. But the risk of a Chinese \u2018hard-landing\u2019 could also deliver benefits for the domestic economy, via cheaper commodities and by staying the MPC\u2019s hand in raising interest rates. Simulations using the Oxford Global Economic Model suggest that a structural hit to Chinese growth would be a net negative to the UK, but less so than for many other economies. Significant developments: China\u2019s central bank is injecting 140bn yuan into the interbank money market to avoid liquidity drying up. The People\u2019s Bank of China has announced plans for new \u2018short-term liquidity\u2019 operations; effectively cheap loans to lenders, who have suffered from the flow of capital out of the country. The moves shows that the PBoC remains concerned that China\u2019s banking sector could run short of funds. Capital has been leaving China since Beijing devalued the yuan earlier this month. And that shortage is be exacerbated when the PBoC tries to prop up the currency by buying yuan (as this leaves less circulating in the real economy). Last week the PBoC launched a 120 billion yuan liquidity injection, which was the biggest in 19 months. Today\u2019s move came after the Shanghai stock market fell again, with investors failing to take solace from yesterday\u2019s rate cuts. Today\u2019s losses on the Shanghai markets have rippled across to Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index closed down 1.5% a few minutes ago. This Bloomberg chart show how the Chinese stock market ran out of juice today, after attempting an afternoon rally: China has muscled the Greek debt crisis out of the way, to become the biggest issue causing investors sleepless nights: The boss of luggage maker Samsonite has warned that sales growth to Chinese customers will halve this year, in a sign that the economy is weakening. Reuters has the details: China sales are expected to grow 15 to 16% on a local currency basis in the second half of the year and beyond,compared with nearly 30% growth in the first half, Chief executive Ramesh Tainwala said. \u201cChina is an important part of our business but not the only part of our business,\u201d Tainwala said, speaking to reporters after the company reported interim results \u201cWe have a very diversified business.\u201d My colleague Mark Sweney has more details of Martin Sorrell\u2019s views on China: One of Britain\u2019s top business chiefs, Sir Martin Sorrell, is still \u201ca raging bull\u201d about the Chinese economy. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme, the boss of advertising giant WPP warned that if China\u2019s economy slows sharply, the impact will be serious. Be careful what you wish for...China has been the biggest driver of the world economy. Sorrell admitted that WPP has been braced for trouble since 2008, despite posting record performances each year since 2011. It\u2019s been trench warfare, hand to hand combat, it\u2019s not been easy. But in the long term, Sorrell insists that China will remain a vital growth engine, along with the other BRICS economies, the smaller next 11 emerging markets, and digital economy. He also conceded that are concerns over the surge in Chinese debt levels. But, as he put it, \u201c\u2018they ain\u2019t done too bad\u201d with a controlled economy since 1985, and \u201cpeople in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201d After that late selloff in China, Europe\u2019s stock markets have now all shed at least 1.7%. The markets are a very nervous place right now, as the late slide on the New York stock exchange last night made very clear. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct adds: It\u2019s Wall Street\u2019s slump ahead of last night\u2019s close that appears to be setting the pace for the UK market and as is often the way after these excessive moves, this volatility appears likely to be with us for some time yet. China\u2019s stock market has fallen again, for the fifth day running, as the market rout continues Despite its central bank\u2019s efforts to calm the crisis by cutting interest rates on Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite index fell another 1.3% by the close of trading. Despite being up 4% earlier today, the stock market suffered a late selloff, showing that investors are still very worried about the situation. That drags the index down to 2927 points, it\u2019s lowest since December 2014. European shares are losing ground at the start of the trading day, with fears over China still gripping the City. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has quickly shed 90 points, a drop of 1.5%, taking it back below the 6000 point mark to 5991 and wiping out half of Tuesday\u2019s recovery. It\u2019s a similar picture elsewhere, with the German Dax down 1.7%. Volatility is \u201cwell and truly still alive in the markets this week\u201d, remarks Augustin Eden of Accendo Markets. Hold onto your (tin) hats. Europe\u2019s stock markets are opening.... Markets have been particularly volatile this week because many investors are still on holiday, meaning less liquidity than usual. David Buik, a City veteran who has lived through more market crashes than anyone else I know, says \u201cnormal working service\u201d will resume next week. He also explains why yesterday\u2019s Chinese interest rate cut isn\u2019t enough: The move by the Chinese authorities attracted considerable adverse criticism not only from the market but also from political heavyweights such as the Japanese Finance Minister, Aso-San, who was not backward in coming forward in implying that last week\u2019s devaluation of the Yuan was \u2018ham-fisted\u2019 and unprofessional. Market observers were also expressing real concern about the robustness of China\u2019s banking sector and the potential threat of a major credit crisis. This issue is more acute than China\u2019s growth contraction. Don\u2019t knock that Scottie Dog technical analysis. As feared, China\u2019s stock market is shedding its gains in late trading. And that means Europe\u2019s selloff may be more dramatic: Speaking of unexpected tumbles..... We\u2019re into the crucial last hour of trading in China. Typically, we\u2019ve seen sharp moves at the end of the day. Will today be different, or can Shanghai hold onto today\u2019s gains? This \u2018technical analysis\u2019 from FastFT\u2019s Patrick McGee shows how the situation could deteriorate from here..... Japan\u2019s stock market has closed for the day, with the Nikkei rallying by over 3%. That claws back some, but not all, of Tuesday\u2019s losses. Here\u2019s the situation across Asia a moment ago: Hello all. It\u2019s a grey day in London. Dark clouds everywhere, and rain on the way. And the mood on the City trading floor is also subdued. European stock markets are expected to fall back this morning, after yesterday\u2019s big rally. It\u2019s expected to be a small drop, rather than a rout, as investors hunker down after several wild days. IG expects all the main indices to drop at the open, in just under an hour\u2019s time: I had been braced for bigger falls, after last night\u2019s late tumble on Wall Street. But the sight of Asian market rising today (in volatile trading) has calmed the nerves, a little. Michael Hewson of CMC Market explains: While European markets basked in the afterglow of yesterday\u2019s Chinese rate cuts, amidst optimism that we may have seen a base earlier this week, US markets inability to hold onto their gains and sink like a soggy blancmange are likely to see a negative open for Europe this morning, though a rebound in Asia has cushioned some of the effects. I\u2019m now handing over the wheel of this live blog to my colleague in London, Graeme Wearden, who will take you through the rest of the day\u2019s markets ups and downs. Thanks for reading and for the comments. Why has the Shanghai Composite returned from its lunch break in more buoyant mood? George Chen, managing editor of the South China Morning Post international edition, has some thoughts: US president Barack Obama held a telephone conversation with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday morning, which touched upon economic issues. Abe\u2019s spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the two leaders agreed to work together on global economic issues in the wake of the stock market meltdown sparked by fears over China. Obama and Abe also discussed market turmoil that has seen a massive global equities sell off after China cut the value of its yuan currency in an apparent bid to boost exports, sparking fears of an economic slowdown and the subsequent impact on global growth. They \u201cwill firmly work together on the economy issue\u201d, Suga said, without elaborating. Shanghai is back from lunch and is having something of a rebound, up around 4%: Chris Weston, chief market strategist for IG, says the day\u2019s action so far has allowed traders \u201cto catch a much-needed breath\u201d: It still feels as though volatility can break out at any time and a quick 1-2% move in US futures, Nikkei, ASX 200 or Hang Seng could materialise at any time. Of course, these sort of moves will happen when the US volatility index (VIX) is at 36% (over double the year average) and the ASX VIX is at 28% (year average 16%). Things can get dicey quickly \u2026 At the time of writing, stronger buying is being seen in the Chinese equity markets, but price action is fairly whippy. The market has seen through yesterday\u2019s 25 basis point cut in benchmark lending rate and the 50 basis point cut to the reserve ratio requirement (RRR). One questions why they didn\u2019t ease over the weekend. The extra liquidity injected into the banking system would be somewhere between RMB650 billion and RMB700 billion, which sits nicely with the recent use of shorter-term liquidity tools. Most understand this easing for what it is: a policy move aimed at counteracting the tightening of financial conditions caused by sizeable capital outflows. This is not going to boost growth \u2026 The focus now falls firmly back on the US, and specifically on New York Fed president Bill Dudley, who will field questions from the press on the local and regional economies. Mr Dudley\u2019s views will be scrutinised by the market, and given the recent change in language last week from Dennis Lockhart (the Atlanta President), it\u2019s hard to get a sense of whether he is going to give an indication of a September hike. You can read our latest report on today\u2019s market developments here: Fergus Ryan sends news from China of police action related to trading \u2013 and to the reporting of it: Following the arrest of a couple of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) officials \u2013 one current and one former \u2013 for insider trading and faking documents, Chinese state media is now reporting that a journalist who was covering the agency is being investigated. Caijing magazine has confirmed that its reporter Wang Xiaolu was summoned by police yesterday in connection with accusations of faking stock news. Chinese stocks nosedived in late July after Wang reported in Caijing that the CSRC was studying exiting funds used to help buoy the stock market. The regulator denied the reports at the time and reiterated that it would continue to stabilise the market and expectations, as well as to prevent systemic risks. The highly respected magazine said in a statement it would take responsibility for its reporters\u2019 work. Earlier, local media reported that Xu Gang, the general manager of Citic Securities, the country\u2019s number one brokerage, has been arrested. Chinese police are yet to provide a reason for the arrest. It\u2019s not the first time Chinese police have taken action in relation to the recent stock market turmoil. In early July, police visited CSRC offices to investigate alleged \u201cmalicious\u201d short-selling of shares. Markets across Asia were holding their breath on Wednesday after early hopes that the worst of this week\u2019s turmoil could be behind them were tempered by concern that China has not done enough to stabilise its economy. A day after China\u2019s central bank lowered interest rates in an attempt to ease the crisis, most Asia-Pacific stocks suffered minor losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei benchmark index mounted a modest comeback after six days of bruising losses. \u201cThere is a sense of relief for now, and stocks with attractive valuations and higher dividend yields are in focus,\u201d said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities. But in China, key share indexes moved up and down as investors continued to sell in a show of apprehension about the health of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. \u201cThe whole market sentiment is still risk-off, which is why markets have taken the latest move from Beijing in its stride and believe more is needed to restore investor sentiment,\u201d said Grace Tam, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. Tokyo stocks had opened higher amid guarded optimism over the Chinese central bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates for the fifth time in nine months. The Nikkei briefly slipped back into negative territory, however, after China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index \u2013 ground zero for this week\u2019s market meltdown \u2013 faltered yet again. Investor confidence was also hit by a last-minute plunge on Wall Street on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 204.91 points, or 1.3%, lower, having been up by as much as 441 points earlier in the day. Wall Street extended its losses for six straight days \u2013 its longest losing stretch for more than three years. In early trading on Wednesday, the Shanghai index fell 1.8% but recovered to end the morning 0.8% up. Australian shares fell 0.5%. Stocks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia were mostly lower. The US dollar avoided any significant drops against the yen, bringing a little cheer to Japanese policymakers, who had voiced concern about the Japanese currency\u2019s surges earlier in the week. A new session high for the Nikkei: up 2.26% to 18.207.37. The Chinese markers are still on their lunch break. Agence France-Presse offers a different perspective on China\u2019s struggles \u2013 the fate of Swiss luxury watch-makers: Swiss watchmakers are facing turbulent times in one of their top markets, as the already shrinking luxury sales in China are compounded by the recent devaluation of the yuan. The move rattled the Alpine country\u2019s luxury watchmakers, who have already seen their once booming sales in China take a hit as Beijing began to crack down on corruption in the country by banning extravagant gifts like prestigious watches to public officials. Even before the yuan move, Swiss watch exports to China had contracted nearly 40% in July. Shares of Swiss luxury goods giant Richemont, which owns brands like Cartier, Piaget and IWC, immediately shed more than 4.0% of their value after the Chinese currency cut. The world\u2019s biggest watch group Swatch, which carries brands like Tissot, Longines and Omega, saw its stock price plunge 3.9%. News comes in that Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak is to hold a press conference around now on the economy; I\u2019ll keep an eye on what emerges from that. A glance at some of the global front pages for Wednesday. The South China Morning Post leads on \u201cstock turmoil\u201d and the bank rate cuts: China\u2019s Global Times also goes in on the interest rate cuts: The International New York Times focuses on China\u2019s stocks dive, but also points out the silence among Chinese state media (the People\u2019s Daily decided not to mention Black Monday in its Tuesday edition; I haven\u2019t yet been able to see a copy of Wednesday\u2019s paper): And the UK\u2019s Financial Times centres on the interest rate cuts: As China hit midday, following a rollercoaster morning, the CSI300 index was up 1.7% and the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.8%. Still an afternoon to get through, of course \u2026 A catch-up of this morning\u2019s choppy activity, via Reuters: Asian stocks fell on Wednesday as investors feared fresh rate cuts in China would not be enough stabilise its cooling economy or halt a collapse in its stock markets. China\u2019s key share indexes attempted to move higher several times in early trade only to be slapped back by waves of selling, reflecting investors\u2019 views that much more support was needed from the government and the central bank. Following a near 20% plunge in stock prices in three days, the People\u2019s Bank of China cut interest rates late on Tuesday and lowered the amount of reserves that banks must hold. While the double-barrelled policy moves were initially cheered by markets around the world, the impact did not last long as investors quickly resumed their focus on the deteriorating outlook for China and the global economy. By midmorning, China\u2019s CSI300 index was down 0.5% at 3,028.48 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index was down 1.3% at 2,925.97. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2% in early trade and was just shy of a three-year low hit in the previous session. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was the lone bright spot, rising 1.3%, while Australia fell 0.4%. In a sign of how fearful investors have become of risky assets, US stock index futures resumed their descent in early Asian trade with the US S&amp;P 500 mini futures down 0.4%, nearing Monday\u2019s 10-month low of 1,831. Overnight, major US stock indexes shot up after China\u2019s policy easing but later gave up all their gains, with the S&amp;P 500 ending down 1.4%. US stock futures were down 0.2% in Asian trade, suggesting further weakness on Wall Street later in the day. The CBOE Market Volatility Index was still elevated at 36, indicating significant uncertainty, even though it was below the previous day\u2019s peak of 53.3, which was the highest level since January 2009. In currencies, the dollar has also broadly lost steam as traders unwound massive carry trade bets in recent years based on higher yielding assets and instead flocked to safe-haven currencies such as euro and yen. The euro was $1.1529, little changed from late US trade, but more than a full cent above Tuesday\u2019s low of $1.1396. The dollar also slipped back to 118.90, failing to maintain its brief foray above the 120 mark. Glenn Stevens, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has been speaking at an economic reform summit in Sydney \u2013 also attended by treasurer Joe Hockey; see here \u2013 about the country\u2019s economic growth issues, AAP reports. Stevens said that despite record low interest rates and business and consumer confidence staying around average, economic growth has not been able to get to 3%. It may be that potential growth is a bit lower than we used to think, though I don\u2019t think we can know whether that is so at present. The fiscal policy debate, usually framed as \u2018when will we get back to surplus?\u2019 is actually about \u2018how do we get more growth?\u2019 Other discussions, so often framed as about fairness that is income distribution might be better framed as \u2018how do we grow the pie?\u2019 Stevens said that the most people understand that economic policy is about increasing economic growth on a sustained basis and that most budget measures to improve growth are only short-term solutions: The kind of growth we want won\u2019t be delivered just by central bank adjustments to interest rates or short-term fiscal initiatives that bring forward demand from next year, only to have to give it back then. A key question worth asking is \u2018how do we generate more growth?\u2019 Not temporary, flash-in-the-pan growth, but sustainable growth. Japan\u2019s main Nikkei 225 stock index ended the morning up 0.5% at 17,896.23, while other Asian stocks fell then rose on what promises to be another unpredictable day of trading. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was up 0.2%, while China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite index source, the victim of a severe bruising earlier in the week, fell 0.4%. Shares in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia were mostly down. Some analysts said that fears of a prolonged crisis may have been overblown, but warned that the region should expect more volatility. \u201cAsia remains the epicentre of the current market instability,\u201d Evan Lucas of IG said. \u201cMarket \u2018stability\u2019 will then come from this region \u2013however the slide in China and Japan suggest sentiment is ruling price action and hyper-fear trading is still in control.\u201d Chinese markets have been choppy in early morning trade as investors reacted to a Tuesday evening rate cut from the People\u2019s Bank of China, Fergus Ryan reports. Seventy minutes into trading and shares on the Shanghai composite had fallen -3.32% to 2,866.45 after seesawing all morning. And here\u2019s that snapshot spelled out. Within the first 20 minutes of trading today, the Shanghai Composite: opened up 0.53%. dropped as much as 2.31%. returned to positive. After half an hour, it was up 0.74%, or 21.84 points, to 2,986.81. On China\u2019s second exchange, the Shenzhen Composite Index was down 0.12%, or 2.07 points, to 1,747.00. This snapshot via Google Finance gives an indication of the volatility of the Shanghai Composite in its first hour this morning: Meanwhile, Fergus Ryan reports from Beijing, a new survey out today indicates the recent stock market volatility may not be affecting Chinese consumer sentiment. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator rose in August, the third straight month it has done so. The indicator rose 1.8% for the month \u2013 the highest it has been since May 2014. Westpac economist Huw McKay said that while global investors were increasingly anxious about China\u2019s growth prospects, Chinese consumers are more sanguine. \u201cThe Chinese economy remains a major source of concern for global investors. This anxiety is shared to some degree by Chinese households, but where foreign scepticism vis-\u00e0-vis growth prospects appears to be deepening, consumers are tentatively marking up growth prospects, albeit from a very low level\u201d he said. However, it\u2019s important to note the survey was conducted before China\u2019s surprise currency devaluation move and before blasts ripped through a chemical warehouse in Tianjin this month. China\u2019s response on Tuesday to the previous day\u2019s precipitous falls had a marked effect on markets yesterday and will no doubt continue to do so today. The key moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China were: reducing the one-year lending rate to 4.6%. cutting the one-year deposit rate to 1.75%. taking half a percentage point off the reserve requirement ratio. Interest rates in the country are now at an all-time low after having averaged 6.36% since a high of 10.98% in June 1996. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, called it a \u201cmeasured response\u201d: Beijing had the scope to do more to boost confidence after the turmoil of recent days, but has opted for a more measured approach at this stage. There are reasons for this. Capital has been leaving China at a rapid rate in recent weeks, and a big reduction in interest rates would have provided extra encouragement for investors to take their money elsewhere. The official line up until now has been that the Chinese economy is slowing in line with expectations rather than in the early stages of a full-blown recession. Slashing interest rates would have been seen as evidence that the economy was indeed suffering a hard landing and might have further damaged confidence. China wants to keep some of its powder dry. The statement issued by the PBoC, which talked about the downward pressure on the economy and the need to have more flexible policy tools to cope with the stock market blowout, reflects how concerned policymakers are about recent events. More on the yuan, set today at its weakest level for four years: China\u2019s yuan weakened early on Wednesday after aggressive monetary easing by the central bank on Tuesday evening. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.4043 per dollar prior to the market open, its weakest level since August 2011, and firmer than the previous day\u2019s closing quote of 6.4124. The spot market opened at 6.4181 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.4181 in early trade, 57 pips away from the previous close and 0.22% away from the midpoint. The spot rate is allowed to trade with a range 2% above or below the official fixing on any given day. The offshore yuan was trading -1.18% away from the onshore spot at 6.495 per dollar. In a long-awaited move which some economists said was overdue, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) said it was cutting the one-year benchmark bank lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.6% and reducing reserve requirements (RRR) by 50 basis points to 18% for most big banks. Premier Li Keqiang was quoted by state television as saying that there is no basis for continued depreciation of the yuan on Tuesday. The central bank stunned global markets by devaluing the currency by nearly 2% on 11 August and then scrambled to stabilise it. However, many investors fear there is strong political pressure to allow it to slowly weaken further lower to boost weak exports and the cooling economy. That report via Reuters in Shanghai. My colleague Fergus Ryan sends this latest from an edgy morning in China: The central bank\u2019s move to ease monetary policy buoyed stocks at the opening of trade on Wednesday, but experts are questioning whether the rally will be durable. The Shanghai Composite has swung wildly in morning trade but appears to be flirting with the 3000-point mark. Taiwan stocks have fallen this morning. As of 1:40 GMT (that\u2019s about 10 minutes ago), the main TAIEX index was off 0.8%, to 7,613.24 points, with the electronics subindex giving up 0.5% and the financials subindex dropping 0.6%, Reuters reports from Taipei. On Tuesday, the main ended up 3.6% after the government said a large state-supported fund will step in \u201cany time\u201d to shore up the sagging market. TSMC, the world\u2019s top contract chip maker, was off 1.6%. Mediatek, Taiwan\u2019s biggest chip design house, lost 2%. The Taiwan dollar firmed T$0.311 to T$32.568 per US dollar. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has said the global economy is not a \u201cone-way escalator\u201d, adding that the instability in world stock markets was a correction after \u201cover-exuberance\u201d in the Chinese market earlier in the year, the AAP news agency reports. \u201cAustralians have every reason to face the future with confidence not withstanding the headwinds overseas,\u201d Abbott said. The Australian share market opened 1% lower on Wednesday. At 1010 AEST (0010 GMT) on Wednesday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 51.4 points, or 1.00%, at 5,085.9, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 49.4 points, or 0.96%, at 5,094.4. On the ASX 24, the September share price index futures contract was down 69 points at 5,058, with 25,730 contracts traded. Treasurer Joe Hockey, speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Sydney on economic reform, warned: There will be volatility in the markets. There are extraordinary capital flows around the world at the moment, in part linked to speculation about the US federal reserve increasing rates. Frankly, you\u2019ve got to see through the volatility and look at the fundamentals and the fundamentals are Australian companies are profitable, they\u2019re well run and Australia is in a very good position for the future. And then, six minutes into trading: Reuters files this snap summary from China openings: China\u2019s major stock indexes opened up on Wednesday after aggressive monetary easings announced by the central bank on Tuesday evening following a massive market slide. The CSI300 index rose 0.7% to 3,062.57 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5% to 2,980.79 points. The benchmark indexes had tumbled 19% in the previous three sessions. China CSI300 stock index futures for September rose 0.4%, to 2,842, -220.57 points below the current value of the underlying index. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut interest rates and lowered the amount of reserves banks must hold for the second time in two months on Tuesday, ratcheting up support for a stumbling economy and a plunging stock market. China\u2019s Financial Futures Exchanges announced on Wednesday morning that they will raise transaction fees and margin requirements for index futures to curb speculation. Benchmark mainland indexes gave up all the gains made from Beijing\u2019s unprecedented stock market rescue in July, in which hundreds of billions of dollars were directed into the market, and this week entered negative territory for the year-to-date. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 0.1%, to 21,434.25 points. Shanghai composite is up by 0.98% in its first 15 minutes. The US dollar has so far avoided any significant drops against the yen, bringing some cheer to Japanese policymakers, who had voiced concern about the Japanese currency\u2019s surges earlier in the week. A weaker yen is a central part of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s quest to boost profits for his country\u2019s auto and consumer electronics manufacturers. A strong yen, however, eats into exporters\u2019 profits once they are repatriated from overseas. The dollar was trading in the upper 118 yen range on Wednesday morning in Tokyo after suffering another drop on Wall Street overnight. The US currency fetched 118.67-69 yen compared with 118.81-91 yen in New York and 119.72-75 yen in Tokyo late on Tuesday. On Monday, the dollar had dipped to as low as 116.15 yen in New York, prompting Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, to warn investors not to push the yen up too far. Investors regard the yen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent days. Will no one think of the billionaires? Bloomberg says 24 billionaires saw their wealth fall by more than $1bn on China\u2019s Black Monday. The biggest loser was the richest man in Asia, Chinese tycoon Wang Jianlin, who lost US$3.6bn, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index says. He still has US$31.2bn left. Microsoft founder Bill Gates was the second biggest loser of the day, with US$3.2bn wiped from his fortunes. Hong Kong resident Li Ka-shing came in third, with a loss of US$1.5bn, followed by Jack Ma, founder of ecommerce group Alibaba and the third richest man in Asia, who waved goodbye to US$546m. Reuters reports from Manila that gold has edged up this morning following its biggest drop in five weeks, as global equities were revived after China cut interest rates and bank reserve requirements to support a flagging economy. But China\u2019s move appears to have only boosted equities temporarily, with US stock futures resuming their descent and Asian shares slightly lower. Further losses in equities could switch appetite back to safe-haven assets such as gold. Meanwhile, back to China, where all is rosy, according to Xinhua, the state\u2019s official news agency: Despite the tumbling of stock markets, investors should forgo their unnecessary anxiety over China because the long-term prediction for China\u2019s economy still remains rosy and Beijing has the will and means to avert a financial crisis. The plunge of stocks, the depreciation of China\u2019s currency and its slowing growth pace after years of high-speed development have all put a question mark on the health of the world\u2019s second largest economy. However, such a worry is completely unnecessary. China\u2019s economy will remain robust and the positive prediction on its future should not be affected by the current fluctuation of stock markets. International investors should calm themselves down and drop their unfounded anxiety over China\u2019s economic future. That\u2019s all OK, then. Here\u2019s a reminder of how things looked from the US at the close of Tuesday, with the Nasdaq, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 all down at the closing bell: The Dow - 15,665, down 205.51 points, 1.29% S&amp;P 500 - 1,867.74, down 25.43 points, 1.34% Nasdaq - 4,506, down 19.76 points, 0.44% And the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry sends this from Tokyo: More volatility has hit Japanese stocks this morning, after further losses on Wall Street, a rate cut by China\u2019s central bank and a rebound in European stocks. In the first 15 minutes of trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei fell 39.6 points, or 0.22%, following a drop of nearly 4% on Tuesday. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 2.83 points, or 0.20%, with insurance firms, banks and the retail sector among those starting the day on an upward curve. My colleague Tom Phillips sends this update from Beijing: This what China\u2019s Global Times newspaper has to say this morning about the country\u2019s week of stock market chaos and what it tells us about the wider economy. The Communist party-controlled paper dismissed foreign doomsayers who are warning of a major financial slowdown here: The Asian stock market followed the fall of the Chinese stock market on Monday, but surged yesterday. This shows that the outside came to realise that the Chinese stock market and the economy are not closely related. The crash has made many people lose heart, but a severe financial or social impact may not come soon. The economy won\u2019t come to a halt. The driving forces for medium- and high-speed growth still exist, and new impetus for the economic boom has been injected into the economy through reforms. Markets in Seoul are open, with the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (Kospi) dropping a little in the first 15 minutes of trading: down 0.45 points (0.02%) to 1,846.18. Samsung Electronics fell 1.48% and Shinhan Financial Group slid by 2.11%, the Yonhap news agency reports. But Hyundai Motor (+1.69%) and Kia Motors (+2.73%) were up. With the Asian markets set to open shortly following days of turmoil, we will have live coverage here of the latest twists and turns. Tuesday saw world markets continue to seesaw after China\u2019s Black Monday. As my colleague Dominic Rushe reports from New York: The Dow Jones industrial average initially appeared to be bouncing back from \u201cBlack Monday\u201d \u2013 a day when it crashed more than 1,000 points before ending the day down 586 points. By noon the Dow was up over 300 points as European markets closed up and investors reacted positively to China\u2019s decision to cut interest rates. But the Dow closed 205 points down, or 1.29%. The S&amp;P 500 ended the day down 25 points, 1.34%, and the Nasdaq closed 0.39% down. The second day of drama came after investors continued to sell in China. The benchmark Shanghai composite index closed 7.6% lower on Tuesday following an 8.5% drop on Monday. Over three days the index has fallen 22%. European markets reversed Monday\u2019s losses but will be closely watched on Wednesday for reaction to the US news. In the UK, the FTSE 100 ended a 10-day losing streak to end up 3%, Germany\u2019s Dax was up 5% and in France the CAC rose 4%.

Of course, these sort of moves will happen when the US volatility index (VIX) is at 36% (over double the year average) and the ASX VIX is at 28% (year average 16%). Things can get dicey quickly \u2026</p> <p>At the time of writing, stronger buying is being seen in the Chinese equity markets, but price action is fairly whippy. The market has seen through yesterday\u2019s 25 basis point cut in benchmark lending rate and the 50 basis point cut to the reserve ratio requirement (RRR). One questions why they didn\u2019t ease over the weekend. The extra liquidity injected into the banking system would be somewhere between RMB650 billion and RMB700 billion, which sits nicely with the recent use of shorter-term liquidity tools.

The Dow has now recovered most of the losses it sustained on Monday and Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also closed higher on Wednesday, following days of losses.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first rise in UK interest rates could be delayed until autumn 2016, according to City expectations, as market turmoil in China raises the prospect of historically low borrowing costs staying in place for longer than expected. The forecasts came as signs emerged of homeowners scrambling to remortgage over the past month in anticipation of a rate increase that might now be delayed. On Wednesday, the British Bankers Association (BBA) said the number of people moving to fix their loans at low rates was at its highest level for four years. It followed Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s indication in mid-July that the Bank could raise interest rates early next year. With the FTSE down 15% from its April high, however, and China cutting interest rates to prop up its slowing economy, City traders have rapidly lost confidence about rate rises in Britain. Market traders had been priced in a rise from the current rate of 0.5% next May, according to analysis by Capital Economics, but in the past few days this has been set back to late September or early October 2016. Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at the investment bank Citi, said his main forecast was still that the Bank would raise rates in early 2016, but added: \u201cIt would not be a big step to expect that bank rate at end-2016 will still be 0.5%\u201d. Reactions to the market selloff may be overblown, said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cRecent equity market volatility and the further fall in commodity prices is probably the final nail in the coffin for those entertaining the possibility of a rise in bank rate this year. But we think markets have gone too far in expecting the MPC to hold off until October next year,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s recent economic data suggest that growth remains sluggish, but not weak enough to justify fears of a \u2018hard landing\u2019. In addition, the UK\u2019s trade links are still fairly small, with only around 5% of goods exports going to China.\u201d The BBA\u2019s figures for the housing market show that mortgage approvals in July were 15% higher than a year ago and house purchases rose 11%. Richard Woolhouse, the BBA\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cEverything that has happened in China this week puts the likelihood of that rise back two to three months. But even if rates do go up in the near future, I don\u2019t think mortgage rates will go up as much and, in any case, this won\u2019t impact much on people\u2019s decision to buy a house.\u201d He said that people would still do \u201cwhatever they can\u201d to get on the housing market in the face of continuing house price rises. Even if they are delayed, rate rises will be small and gradual, rising to 3% over the next five years, he predicted. \u201cEven if rates go up faster than expected I don\u2019t think that would affect the housing market. The fact is that price rises are being driven by a shortage of housing and demand outstripping supply,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Central bankers have their own lingo. They tend to speak in tortured prose that obscures more than it illuminates. Given the choice, they favour a gnomic utterance over plain speaking. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve and the second most important US central banker after Janet Yellen, has just provided a masterclass in central bank-speak. Asked what the latest turbulence in the financial markets meant, Dudley replied that recent economic data had been \u201cpretty positive\u201d. He added, however, that from his perspective the case for the Fed to start \u201cthe normalisation process\u201d - translation: raising interest rates - was \u201cless compelling\u201d than it was a few weeks ago. This is the sort of utterance that used to get Harry Truman hopping mad. The former US president once said that he longed for a one-handed economist, so fed up was he with his advisers saying that on the one hand it looked like this, while on the other hand it looked like that. In truth, for a central banker Dudley was being perfectly clear. As a member of the US central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee he will not be voting for the cost of borrowing to go up at the Fed\u2019s meeting in September, and it is reasonable to assume that Yellen will not be either. The chances of a rate increase next month are not completely dead in the water, but they are receding by the day. Dudley has been one of the more hawkish members of the Fed\u2019s interest rate-setting committee, but he is now having second thoughts. That\u2019s not because there is any immediate prospect of the US economy collapsing. The data released while the markets have been nosediving this week has, as Dudley says, been \u201cpretty positive\u201d. The news on consumer confidence, the property market and investment was all relatively upbeat. There are, however, other arguments that are likely to persuade the Fed to stay its hand. The recent economic data has pointed to a solid recovery rather than a boom. Unemployment has come down, but there is little evidence of wage inflation. US consumers are more exposed to the stock market than their British and other European counterparts, so any plunge in share prices affects spending because people feel poorer. The so-called wealth effect is one reason Alan Greenspan\u2019s reflex response to trouble on Wall Street was to cut interest rates. Yellen is unable to cut interest rates because they are already so low. With the exception of the early 1980s, however, when Paul Volcker was intent on crushing inflation whatever the cost, the Fed\u2019s instinct since the Great Depression of the 1930s has been to avoid action that risks pushing the economy into recession. Expect Yellen to continue this tradition. The fall in the global oil price is a double-edged sword for the US. The boost to consumer spending power will be offset by the fact that Brent crude at $43 (\u00a328) a barrel makes US shale production uneconomic. The oil price is caught in a pincer movement. Demand from China is going down, while the nuclear deal with Iran means supply is poised to go up. What\u2019s more, the price of copper \u2013 historically a good indicator of turning points in the global economy \u2013 is signalling a marked slowdown. A US interest rate rise has been a long time coming. The last time the Fed pushed up the cost of borrowing was in 2006, so it can hardly be accused of being trigger happy. Having waited this long, however, it is going to conclude that there is no harm done in waiting a little longer. The same applies to the Bank of England, even though there has been recent radio silence from the nine members of the monetary policy committee during the August holiday period. Those people rushing to take out fixed-rate mortgages because they think Threadneedle Street is about to tighten policy have plenty of time to secure the best deal, because it is not going to happen this year. Indeed, there is more chance that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will provide extra stimulus through their quantitative easing programmes than there is of the Fed or the Old Lady raising rates.",

The data released while <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/markets-bonds-usa-durablegoods-idUSL1N1110OS20150826\">the markets have been nosediving this week</a> has, as Dudley says, been \u201cpretty positive\u201d. The news on consumer confidence, the property market and investment was all relatively upbeat.</p> <p>There are, however, other arguments that are likely to persuade the Fed to stay its hand. The recent economic data has pointed to a solid recovery rather than a boom. Unemployment has come down, but there is little evidence of wage inflation.</p> <p>US consumers are more exposed to the stock market than their British and other European counterparts, so any plunge in share prices affects spending because people feel poorer. The so-called wealth effect is one reason Alan Greenspan\u2019s reflex response to trouble on Wall Street was to cut interest rates.</p> <p>Yellen is unable to cut interest rates because they are already so low. With the exception of the early 1980s, however, when Paul Volcker was intent on crushing inflation whatever the cost, the Fed\u2019s instinct since the Great Depression of the 1930s has been to avoid action that risks pushing the economy into recession. </p> <p>Expect Yellen to continue this tradition. The fall in the global oil price is a double-edged sword for the US. The boost to consumer spending power will be offset by the fact that Brent crude at $43 (\u00a328) a barrel makes US shale production uneconomic. </p> <p>The oil price is caught in a pincer movement. Demand from China is going down, while the nuclear deal with Iran means supply is poised to go up. What\u2019s more, the price of copper \u2013 historically a good indicator of turning points in the global economy \u2013 is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/markets-metals-idUSL5N1111ZX20150826\">signalling a marked slowdown</a>.</p> <p>A US interest rate rise has been a long time coming. The last time the Fed pushed up the cost of borrowing was in 2006, so it can hardly be accused of being trigger happy. Having waited this long, however, it is going to conclude that there is no harm done in waiting a little longer.</p> <p>The same applies to the Bank of England, even though there has been recent radio silence from the nine members of the monetary policy committee during the August holiday period. Those people rushing to take out fixed-rate mortgages because they think Threadneedle Street is about to tighten policy have plenty of time to secure the best deal, because it is not going to happen this year. </p> <p>Indeed, there is more chance that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will provide extra stimulus through their quantitative easing programmes than there is of the Fed or the Old Lady raising rates.</p>",

The Indian-owned company has told staff that it plans to scale down production in the face of fierce competition from China. It said none of its own permanent employees at Llanwern would lose their jobs and declined to say how many agency staff were at risk. Unions, however, predict that 250 jobs will be axed, on top of the 720 full-time staff already facing redundancy at Tata\u2019s plant in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. The firm cut 400 jobs at its Port Talbot site in south Wales last summer. \u201cSurging, and often unfairly traded, imports have combined with a strong pound to create a very challenging business environment,\u201d said Stuart Wilkie, the director of Tata Strip Products UK. \u201cThe changes we have told employees about will reduce our costs and enable us to focus on generating more value from our products, which will improve our competitiveness.\u201d Dave Hulse, the GMB union\u2019s national officer, said there were genuine concerns about the future of the steel industry in the UK, which he partly blamed on rising energy costs. \u201cWe will see local communities destroyed with mass unemployment, while the balance of payment deficit will increase further if we don\u2019t act now and get government support and action,\u201d he said. \u201cEnergy-intensive industries need access to affordable and secure energy.

Roy Rickhuss, the chairman of the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, said the strength of the pound and a flood of Chinese imports were also killing the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that these young people, who have been trained up by Tata and in normal circumstances would be considered the future of the business, are being let go in the drive to cut costs and remain competitive in the global marketplace,\u201d he said. It is only a few months since the Unite union balloted its 6,000 members at Tata Steel over its plan to close the British Steel pension scheme, but the two sides eventually reached a peaceful settlement.

The much-maligned Irish chaps were one of 22 airlines to be awarded two stars, which means that Air Koryo is precisely half as good as Ryanair. Blimey. And all because the planes are a bit long in the tooth? Nope, the Skytrax report also cites \u201cquestionable\u201d safety and rudimentary safety belts, which is why pretty much all of Air Koryo\u2019s planes are banned in the European Union because they\u2019re a horrendous risk. Ah well, Ibiza it is then. Do say: \u201cI seem to have left my boarding pass in my illegal jeans.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHey, look! Asiana Airlines in South Korea got five stars from Skytrax!

      "bodyText": "The boss of McDonald\u2019s in the UK has defended the company\u2019s continued use of zero-hours contracts for about 80,000 employees in its British restaurants. Paul Pomroy, who took over the running of the UK operation in December, said staff loved the flexibility of the contracts, which have been criticised for exploiting workers. He told the BBC: \u201cWe still have zero-hours contracts and they are very flexible contracts, so people at McDonald\u2019s get their shifts two weeks in advance and we allow employees to go and work elsewhere. \u201cWe have a very good system of feedback from our employees and having surveyed our employees they still love the flexibility.\u201d McDonald\u2019s said about 80% of the 100,000-plus employees at franchised and company-owned restaurants in the UK were on zero-hours contracts, and that 92% of employees in a survey of company-owned restaurants said they were happy with theim. The chain has been criticised for its use of the contracts, which became emblematic of harsher working terms and greater pressure exerted on employees in the last parliament. Official figures in February showed that almost 700,000 people were on zero-hours contracts, which at their harshest can require employees to work at short notice and prevent them working elsewhere. McDonald\u2019s said all of its employees had permanent contracts and were entitled to holiday and sick pay, staff discounts, training and regular performance reviews. As well as being free to work elsewhere, employees are not required to be on call, the company said. The contracts continue to cause controversy. Unions representing staff at Sports Direct\u2019s main warehouse have filed a pay claim asking the retailer to move thousands of zero-hours workers who were excluded from staff bonuses on to permanent contracts. Pomroy said McDonald\u2019s is reviewing how it will pay the new national living wage to staff aged over 25. The company pays just above the current minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour for UK workers aged 21 and over. The minimum wage for over-25s, which George Osborne has rebranded as the national living wage, will increase to \u00a37.20 in 2017 before rising to at least \u00a39 by 2020 under the chancellor\u2019s plan. Pomroy said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the immediate move in the rate to \u00a37.20. It\u2019s understanding the knock-on effects and how we can manage that over the next three or four years, and we\u2019re working through that.\u201d Philip Pepper, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau, said zero hours contracts had been open to abuse by employers by putting staff on standby or preventing them working elsewhere, but such exclusivity clauses had been outlawed. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s seems to have their working practices in order by offering all staff rotas two weeks in advance and many employees welcome the flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it would be wrong to assume that zero-hours contracts are suitable for all employers and they should seriously consider whether the benefits of the contracts are workable for their business.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery has helped bonuses return to within a whisker of their pre-recession peak, according to official data. The Office for National Statistics said that salary top-ups rose by 2.7% in 2014-15 to \u00a342.4bn, despite less generous payouts in the City. The total was 0.1% below the record reached in 2007-08, but the ONS said the figures did not account for rising inflation over the past seven years. Its breakdown of the data showed that the boom years for the City have yet to return. Bonuses in the finance and insurance sector are running at less than 75% of their 2007-08 level after falling 10% last year. Basic pay has tended to be less important for the City than the rest of the economy, but the ONS said bonuses as a percentage of salary peaked at 34% in 2006-07 and has since dropped to 20%. In contrast, bonuses in the rest of the economy have held at 4% of basic salary. They rose by almost 10% in 2014-15, with the biggest increases seen in professional, scientific and technical services and information and communication. The ONS said the fall in bonuses in the finance and insurance sector was probably exaggerated by the higher than normal payouts in 2013-14, when many City firms deferred their awards so staff could take advantage of the cut in the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45%. The average payout per employee in the whole economy was \u00a31,500, compared with \u00a313,100 in the financial and insurance sector. James Sproule, the Institute of Directors\u2019 chief economist, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures, which show both bonuses and base salaries continue to rise is good news, and another sign of improved corporate performance and strong business confidence. \u201cIn the financial and insurance industries, the fact that bonuses now make up a significantly smaller chunk of take-home pay suggests steps have been taken since the financial crisis to rein in excess.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Paddy Power and Betfair have agreed a \u00a35bn merger to form the world\u2019s biggest listed online betting and gaming company and the market leader in the UK. The proposed deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the gambling industry as companies seek to cope with more taxes and regulation and the need to spend on technology as gambling increasingly goes online. The merged group, to be called Paddy Power Betfair, would have revenues of more than \u00a31.1bn, giving it greater scale to compete for customers, and brands that are a good match, the companies said. It would also have opportunities to expand in Europe, the US and Australia and to cut costs. Cormac McCarthy, Paddy Power\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cThese are two very strong businesses with complementary offerings that have a lot in common. We have seen increased regulation and taxes across the piece and scale has value.\u201d Betfair\u2019s chief executive and ex-Paddy Power chief operating officer, Breon Corcoran, will lead the new group if the deal goes through. He was lured to run Betfair three years ago and has won praise for reinvigorating the company. Paddy Power\u2019s chief executive, Andy McCue, would be chief operating officer and Gary McGann, chairman of Paddy Power, would chair the combined company. The deal announcement comes two months after Ladbrokes and Gala Coral revealed plans to create the UK\u2019s biggest bookmaker. In other strategic moves, online gaming group 888 has agreed to buy its rival Bwin.party but GVC Holdings, owner of Sportingbet, is trying to hijack the deal to buy Bwin. The flurry of dealmaking in the gambling sector is the result of new taxes on online gambling around the world and the need to invest in marketing and technology to compete in the fast-changing world of internet betting. Under the terms of the deal, Paddy Power shareholders would own 52% of the combined group and Betfair shareholders would own 48%. Shares in Paddy Power and Betfair rose 18% and 17% respectively on the news. Paddy Power, the aggressive Irish bookmaker that courts controversy and operates on UK and Irish high streets and online, is the larger of the two, with a market capitalisation of \u20ac3.46bn (\u00a32.54bn) at Tuesday\u2019s close. The deal unites it with Betfair\u2019s online gambling exchange, which lets punters bet against each other in real time instead of accepting bookies\u2019 odds. Betfair, valued at \u00a32.4bn, has seen its shares rise by 140% in a year on the back of strong revenue growth. The new group would be the market leader online in the UK with a share of 16%, according to industry data, passing a merged Ladbrokes Coral group on 14%, as well as William Hill and privately owned Bet365. Under the proposed merger, the two brands will operate side by side in Europe. Paddy Power\u2019s portfolio of almost 600 betting shops, more than half of which are in Britain, will also remain part of the plans. Alongside its core exchange product, Betfair is also targeting a larger share of the broader sports betting market. The companies gave out little detail about where costs would be cut or how extra revenues would be achieved, prompting analysts to ask Paddy Power on a conference call why it had announced the deal now. But analysts at Davy, the Irish stockbroker, said the deal made sense for both businesses. \u201cThe two best-quality companies in the European online gaming sector are on the verge of merging. Both have proven management teams of the highest quality, with long track records of high returns on capital, very strong compound earnings growth and substantial cash returns over time. The combined entity is likely to be greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, we see substantial value-creation potential from the proposed merger.\u201d Corcoran has been credited with turning around the fortunes of Betfair. Since taking the helm, he has increased UK customer numbers by 250% and Betfair\u2019s share value has risen from about \u00a3750m to \u00a32.4bn. The company has developed an online conventional bookmaking service to complement the betting exchange product.",

      "bodyText": "Markets across Asia were holding their breath on Wednesday after early hopes that the worst of this week\u2019s turmoil could be behind them were tempered by concern that China has not done enough to stabilise its economy. A day after China\u2019s central bank lowered interest rates in an attempt to ease the crisis, most Asia-Pacific stocks suffered minor losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei benchmark index mounted a modest comeback after six days of bruising losses. With the trading day several hours old, the Nikkei had gained 0.4%. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 18.81 points, or 1.3%. China\u2019s central bank also increased the amount of money available for lending by reducing the reserves banks are required to hold. \u201cThere is a sense of relief for now, and stocks with attractive valuations and higher dividend yields are in focus,\u201d said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities. But in China, key share indexes moved up and down as investors continued to sell in a show of apprehension about the health of the world\u2019s second biggest economy. \u201cThe whole market sentiment is still risk-off, which is why markets have taken the latest move from Beijing in its stride and believe more is needed to restore investor sentiment,\u201d said Grace Tam, global markets strategist at JP Morgan asset management in Hong Kong. Tokyo stocks had opened higher amid guarded optimism over the Chinese central bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates for the fifth time in nine months. The Nikkei briefly slipped back into negative territory, however, after China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index \u2013 ground zero for this week\u2019s market meltdown \u2013 faltered yet again. Investor confidence was also hit by a last-minute plunge on Wall Street on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 204.91 points, or 1.3%, lower, having been up by as much as 441 points earlier in the day. Wall Street extended its losses for six straight days, its longest losing stretch for more than three years. In early trading on Wednesday, the Shanghai index fell 1.8% but recovered to end the morning 0.8% up. Australian shares fell 0.5%. Stocks in New Zealand, Taiwan and south-east Asia were mostly lower. Some analysts said that fears of a prolonged market crisis sparked by concern over China\u2019s economic outlook may be overblown, but they warned that the region should expect more volatility. \u201cAsia remains the epicenter of the current market instability,\u201d Evan Lucas of IG said. \u201cMarket \u2018stability\u2019 will then come from this region. However the slide in China and Japan suggest sentiment is ruling price action and hyper-fear trading is still in control.\u201d The US dollar avoided any significant drops against the yen, bringing a little cheer to Japanese policymakers who had been worried about the Japanese currency\u2019s surges earlier in the week. A weaker yen is a central part of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s quest to boost profits for his country\u2019s auto and consumer electronics manufacturers. A strong yen, however, eats into exporters\u2019 profits once they are repatriated from overseas. The dollar was trading in the upper 118 yen range in Tokyo on Wednesday morning after suffering another drop in New York overnight. The US currency fetched 118.67-69 yen compared with 118.81-91 yen in New York and 119.72-75 yen in Tokyo late on Tuesday. On Monday, the dollar had dipped to as low as 116.15 yen in New York, prompting Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, to warn investors not to push the yen up too far. Investors see the yen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent days.",

Australian shares fell 0.5%.</p> <p>Stocks in New Zealand, Taiwan and south-east Asia were mostly lower.</p> <p>Some analysts said that fears of a prolonged market crisis sparked by concern over China\u2019s economic outlook may be overblown, but they warned that the region should expect more volatility.</p> <p>\u201cAsia remains the epicenter of the current market instability,\u201d Evan Lucas of IG said. \u201cMarket \u2018stability\u2019 will then come from this region. However the slide in China and Japan suggest sentiment is ruling price action and hyper-fear trading is still in control.\u201d</p> <p>The US dollar avoided any significant drops against the yen, bringing a little cheer to Japanese policymakers who had been worried about the Japanese currency\u2019s surges earlier in the week.</p> <p>A weaker yen is a central part of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s quest to boost profits for his country\u2019s auto and consumer electronics manufacturers. A strong yen, however, eats into exporters\u2019 profits once they are repatriated from overseas.</p> <p>The dollar was trading in the upper 118 yen range in Tokyo on Wednesday morning after suffering another drop in New York overnight.</p> <p>The US currency fetched 118.67-69 yen compared with 118.81-91 yen in New York and 119.72-75 yen in Tokyo late on Tuesday.</p> <p>On Monday, the dollar had dipped to as low as 116.15 yen in New York, prompting Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, to warn investors not to push the yen up too far.<br>Investors see the yen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent days.<br></p>",
