      "bodyText": "The billionaire retailer Mike Ashley has been running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse, building his success on a business model that treats workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d, a scathing parliamentary inquiry has found. The report by the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which was triggered by a Guardian investigation last year, said Ashley had used \u201cappalling working practices\u201d and treated his \u201cworkers as commodities rather than as human beings\u201d. The committee\u2019s chairman, Iain Wright, said: \u201cWhistleblowers, parts of the media and a trade union shone a light on work practices at Sports Direct, and what they revealed was extremely disturbing. The evidence we heard points to a business whose working practices are closer to that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable high street retailer. For this to occur in the UK in 2016 is a serious indictment of the management at Sports Direct and Mike Ashley, as the face of Sports Direct, must be held accountable for these failings. \u201cIt seems incredible that Mike Ashley, who visits the Shirebrook warehouse at least once a week, was unaware of these appalling practices. This suggests Mr Ashley was turning a blind eye to conditions at Sports Direct in the interests of maximising profits, or that there are serious corporate governance failings which left him out of the loop in spite of all the evidence.\u201d After taking evidence in June from Ashley, Sports Direct workers, union representatives and the agencies that employ the majority of the 3,000 staff working in the firm\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse, the committee concluded that: Sports Direct\u2019s \u201csuccess is founded on a business model that enables the majority of workers in both the warehouse at Shirebrook and at the shops around the UK to be treated without dignity or respect\u201d. Low prices in the chain\u2019s stores come at a cost to workers who are viewed \u201cas commodities rather than as human beings with rights, responsibilities and aspirations\u201d. The \u201csix-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d policy in the warehouse, where workers can be sacked if they receive six black marks over a six-month period, is a \u201cpunitive measure, which denigrates the workers at Sports Direct and gives the management unreasonable and excessive powers to discipline or dismiss at will\u201d. \u201cNo convincing reason\u201d was given as to why Sports Direct maintains a workforce of more than 3,000 warehouse workers on short-term, temporary contracts, \u201cother than to reduce costs and pass responsibility\u201d. Transline, one of two agencies that supplies Sports Direct with temporary staff, may have deliberately misled the committee in its evidence \u201cwhich could be considered a contempt of parliament\u201d. The retailer has suffered a stream of criticism for its working practices, with officials from the union Unite campaigning against a strict culture in the warehouse which has made workers afraid to speak out over low pay and conditions in case they lose their jobs. Last year, primary schoolteachers told the Guardian that parents working at Sports Direct were too frightened to take time off work, resulting in pupils attending school while ill or returning home to empty houses. Luke Primarolo, the regional officer at Unite, said: \u201cFrom our perspective, these issues stem from the majority of the workforce being employed precariously, either through agency or zero-hours contracts. The road to dealing with this has to involve moving the workforce on to fixed-hour, permanent contracts. \u201cSports Direct is by no means the only company to engage people on such terms. What this highlights is a wider issue of real work today. The government needs to seriously consider what legislation needs to be put in place to protect people from exploitation.\u201d Despite initially refusing to give evidence to MPs, Ashley appeared before the committee in June and admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. The admission confirmed the findings of undercover Guardian reporters, who exposed how the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum wage. Ashley also admitted to the committee that his company was under investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs for breaching the wage law. Sports Direct responded to last year\u2019s reports by announcing an internal review of the retailer\u2019s working practices to be led by Ashley, plus a pay rise for staff, which the company said would cost it \u00a310m. In an article in the Guardian, Wright said: \u201cIt was clear that [Ashley\u2019s internal review] was hot air; a PR stunt designed to get over some damaging headlines. But, for all the theatre of his appearance in front of our committee last month, Mike Ashley, to his credit, made a very public promise to take action. He has now established a review of working practices \u2013 conducted by independent lawyers \u2013 which will report by early September.\u201d The committee has no real powers to punish the tycoon if he fails to deliver on his pledges, although Wright promised to \u201ccontinue to hold Mr Ashley\u2019s feet to the fire, in as constructive a manner as possible, checking on the progress he makes on improving working conditions for workers at his premises\u201d. The Labour MP had less conciliatory words for representatives of the employment agency Transline, however, who he accused of misleading the committee and raised the prospect of triggering contempt of parliament proceedings. During an evidence session, Jennifer Hardy, the finance director of Transline, was asked about the company having its licence revoked by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, which regulates companies involved in food and drink processing. She told the committee it had not been revoked, but had lapsed, a claim that the GLA subsequently told the committee to be \u201ccategorically not true\u201d. A spokesman for Transline Group said: \u201cTransline representatives attended the committee to give a transparent account of our operations at Shirebrook. No incorrect or misleading information was given and we will respond to the committee on any and all issues raised within the report within the two-week deadline stipulated. Transline remains committed to ensuring a safe working environment and fulfilling its duty of care to our employees.\u201d A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe will study the contents of the committee\u2019s report very carefully. It is our policy to treat all our people with dignity and respect. \u201cWe are pleased to see that the committee has recognised Mike Ashley\u2019s commitment to engage in addressing any shortcomings in the working practices at Sports Direct.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Smartphone-addicted Britons are embracing mobile banking, with payments via apps rocketing 54% in 2015 and reaching a value of \u00a3347m. The average customer of certain UK banks views their finances on their phone more than once a day \u2013 and much of this balance checking and payment making is done while people watch TV, according to a report by the British Bankers\u2019 Association. The average branch in the high street deals with only 71 customer visits a day \u2013 a 32% decline since 2011 \u2013 as consumers switch to online methods of managing money, the BBA says. Customers use banking apps more than 7,610 times a minute \u2013 or 4bn times a year. Some of these services do a lot more than allow users to check their account balance or make payments. Atom, one of the new breed of digital banks, offers an app with a display that changes colour if the customer\u2019s finances are in good health but starts to \u201cthrob\u201d if there is something they need to attend to that will cost them money. Royal Bank of Scotland upgraded its app this year to allow customers to apply for a personal loan or credit card or manage an overdraft while on the move. Apps are increasingly preferred to banks\u2019 websites, according to BBA figures, noting that internet banking logins fell in number slightly last year. The big loser from this latest digital revolution appears to be high-street branches. The average number of visits is projected to fall to only 51 a day within five years. More than 680 UK bank branches closed last year, on top of the 512 that went in 2014, according to the Campaign for Community Banking Services. The BBA report said customers were the biggest winners from the \u201cconsumer-led revolution\u201d but such claims could fuel concerns of the technology being used to justify further branch closures. Campaigners said more closures would affect vulnerable customers and regular users of branch counters, such as traders and voluntary groups. Derek French, director of the campaign group, said: \u201cWe have no problem with further digitisation, we welcome it. Where we are concerned is that the closure of branches is proceeding at a faster pace than any alternatives that are being put in place to assist vulnerable customers and others.\u201d The report points to a \u201cstaggering\u201d increase in people using mobile apps, which it said proved that it was \u201cnow easier than ever to interact with your bank\u201d. More than 40,000 of these mobile applications were downloaded a day in 2015 \u2013 up 25% on the year before \u2013 while the number of logins to banking apps leapt 50% to reach almost 11m a day. \u201cAnyone who doubts just how much mobile banking has become part of the daily routine for millions of us should consider just how frequently customers login to their apps. Some BBA members have reported that the average customer now logs in to check their balance or make a payment 36 times a month,\u201d the report says. The technology was making it easier to squeeze routine banking tasks into busy lives. \u201cMany financial chores that traditionally had to be done by trudging off to the nearest high-street branch can now be done without taking a step out of your way.\u201d Checking an account balance via a mobile app might take three seconds rather than the 30 seconds necessary to log in to internet banking. Research by TSB found that 45% of mobile or internet banking was carried out while the customers were in front of a TV; about 18% was done at work, 17% in bed and 11% while commuting. However, it seems that when it comes to more complex transactions, many people still prefer the personal touch provided by a bank branch, or at the very least, online banking via a computer. George Charalambous, head of digital transformation at HSBC retail banking, said to the report\u2019s authors: \u201cWould I, as a customer, expect to complete a mortgage application end-to-end on my mobile? Maybe I wouldn\u2019t, maybe that\u2019s something I want to do in the privacy of my home, on a laptop or desktop.\u201d The report highlights data estimates showing that the number of visits to bank branches has fallen, from 476m in 2011 to 278m in 2016. The BBA attempted to reassure those who might be concerned, saying that few bank experts believed the mobile app would \u201csound the death knell\u201d for bank branches. And some banks were continuing to keep the faith: the relative newcomer Metro Bank is on Friday opening its 42nd outlet, in Bexleyheath, south-east London.",

Where we are concerned is that the closure of branches is proceeding at a faster pace than any alternatives that are being put in place to assist vulnerable customers and others.\u201d</p> <p>The report points to a \u201cstaggering\u201d increase in people using mobile apps, which it said proved that it was \u201cnow easier than ever to interact with your bank\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>More than 40,000 of these mobile applications were downloaded a day in 2015 \u2013 up 25% on the year before \u2013 while the number of logins to banking apps leapt 50% to reach almost 11m a day.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54d09174011aec861fd9c06e285ec89529785ca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54d09174011aec861fd9c06e285ec89529785ca6/0_144_3232_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo, at the paw end of the demographic, tests out a new Metro bank branch in Holborn, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugo, at the paw end of the demographic, tests out a new Metro bank branch in Holborn, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnyone who doubts just how much mobile banking has become part of the daily routine for millions of us should consider just how frequently customers login to their apps. Some BBA members have reported that the average customer now logs in to check their balance or make a payment 36 times a month,\u201d the report says. </p> <p>The technology was making it easier to squeeze routine banking tasks into busy lives. \u201cMany financial chores that traditionally had to be done by trudging off to the nearest high-street branch can now be done without taking a step out of your way.\u201d Checking an account balance via a mobile app might take three seconds rather than the 30 seconds necessary to log in to internet banking. </p> <p>Research by TSB found that 45% of mobile or internet banking was carried out while the customers were in front of a TV; about 18% was done at work, 17% in bed and 11% while commuting.<br></p> <p>However, it seems that when it comes to more complex transactions, many people still prefer the personal touch provided by a bank branch, or at the very least, online banking via a computer. <br></p> <p>George Charalambous, head of digital transformation at HSBC retail banking, said to the report\u2019s authors: \u201cWould I, as a customer, expect to complete a mortgage application end-to-end on my mobile? Maybe I wouldn\u2019t, maybe that\u2019s something I want to do in the privacy of my home, on a laptop or desktop.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report highlights data estimates showing that the number of visits to bank branches has fallen, from 476m in 2011 to 278m in 2016. </p> <p>The BBA attempted to reassure those who might be concerned, saying that few bank experts believed the mobile app would \u201csound the death knell\u201d for bank branches. And some banks were continuing to keep the faith: the relative newcomer Metro Bank is on Friday opening its 42nd outlet, in Bexleyheath, south-east London.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Five months and millions of free burritos into its sales recovery plans, Chipotle is still struggling to lure back its once-loyal customers. On Thursday, the Mexican food chain reported that its sales for the second quarter came in at 23.6% lower than they did a year ago. Last quarter, as Chipotle began its recovery, it posted its first quarterly loss since going public. Chipotle\u2019s troubles all started in October of last year, when an E coli outbreak and a series of norovirus cases scared off its loyal customer base. This quarter, Chipotle posted a net loss of $0.8m for the six months ending in June. Last year, during that same period, the company posted a net income of $262.8m. \u201cWe returned to profitability,\u201d Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-chief executive officer, pointed out. On a call with investors, Ells noted that he wished for the sales recovery to move at quicker pace. During the second quarter, he said, it \u201ccontinued at a modest pace\u201d. The company is making more efforts to win back its customers \u2013 including the addition of chorizo to its menu and a new rewards program through which customers can earn free chips and burritos. The first phase of the sales recovery plan was launched back in February, when Chipotle closed all of its stores for a company-wide meeting on food safety. After the meeting, its staff gave out coupons for free meals. As part of those efforts, Chipotle gave out more than 6m free burritos and 1m free orders of chips and guacamole. At the beginning of July, just as the third quarter began, Chipotle announced a new rewards program, Chiptopia. The program is temporary and is scheduled to end in September. The company hopes that by rewarding customers for coming in more frequently with burritos and free chips, it will facilitate restoring of their trust. Especially, since most of its loyal customers who used to come three to four times a week prior to last October, now only come once or twice. According to Ells, 30% of all transaction were part of Chiptopia and the store traffic numbers for July were improving. Chipotle\u2019s officers view every visit \u201cas an opportunity to further restore trust\u201d. Chiptopia has 3.6 million participants so far. Results from the current program will be analyzed in order to devise another rewards program, which the company said will be introduced after Chiptopia ends in September. It has not yet been decided whether that program will be temporary or not. The company said that Chiptopia and A Love Story, a short film released by Chipotle, were part of the strategy to create \u201cnew news\u201d that would allow the company to reclaim the its \u201cvoice\u201d and introduce Chipotle to new customers. Unfortunately for Chipotle, the same day that it added chorizo to its menus in select cities and rolled out Chiptopia, its chief creative and development officer Mark Crumpacker was indicted for allegedly purchasing drugs. His arrest was part of a cocaine delivery service bust in New York. Crumpacker, who joined Chipotle in 2009 and was one of the executives leading the marketing efforts to restore the company\u2019s image, has since been placed on leave. Ells noted that the company was surprised to learn of Crumpacker\u2019s \u201cpersonal issues\u201d. Chipotle has \u201cthe utmost confidence\u201d in the teams he has established, Ells said.",

      "bodyText": "A former HSBC banker facing charges of fraudulently \u201cfront-running\u201d a $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) currency trade has denied the allegations in a New York court. London-based Stuart Scott, who left HSBC in 2014, was named alongside HSBC\u2019s Mark Johnson, who was arrested by the FBI on Tuesday at New York\u2019s JFK airport as he tried to board a flight to London. While Johnson is out on $1m bail in New York after spending Tuesday night in prison, Scott has not been arrested, and his lawyer, Gerallt Owen, a partner at the law firm Withers, said: \u201cOur client strongly denies the allegations. Given there are ongoing proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d According to documents filed in the eastern district court of New York, the Britons are alleged to have bought pounds before doing so for a client which wanted to convert $3.5bn into sterling. The client was not named in the US courts, but it is thought to be the London-listed exploration company Cairn Energy, which was selling its Indian operation, Vedanta, in 2011. According to the US Department of Justice, HSBC generated profits of $8m from the transaction: $3m from front-running and a $5m fee from the client. \u201cThe complaint alleges that Johnson and Scott caused the $3.5bn foreign exchange transaction to be executed in a manner that was designed to spike the price of the pound sterling, to the benefit of HSBC and at the expense of their client,\u201d the DoJ said. It said Johnson exclaimed \u201cOhhhh, fucking Christmas!\u201d when told the deal was going through in December 2011. The prosecutors claim the pair had discussed how far they could \u201cramp\u201d the price of sterling against the dollar before their client would \u201csqueal\u201d. The bank is understood to have reviewed the Cairn transaction as part of an internal investigation that took place when regulators and prosecutors were scrutinising the foreign exchange market. HSBC found no wrongdoing. However, the regulators\u2019 investigation resulted in huge fines for a number of major banks, including HSBC, which was made to pay \u00a3389m by US and UK regulators. Scott was fired by HSBC in 2014, shortly after the fine was levied. He had been head of foreign exchange trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. His lawyer would not comment when asked about his current employment. Scott reported to Johnson, who remains on HSBC\u2019s payroll. The bank refused to say whether it was supporting Johnson or providing legal assistance. According to remarks reportedly made by his lawyer during a court appearance on Wednesday, Johnson is in the process of moving to the US. Bloomberg reported his lawyer telling the court: \u201cThe irony of this case, your honour, was that he was in the process of being transferred by his employers from London to the US.\u201d The lawyer, Frank Wohl, said: \u201cHe has spent the last few weeks preparing to move his wife and six children to the US.\u201d Johnson, 50, who was to become head of foreign exchange and commodities of HSBC\u2019s US operations, has surrendered his passport. He is staying in an apartment near New York\u2019s Central Park, which has a 24-hour concierge, children\u2019s playroom, pet spa and health club. He did not answer the door on the second-storey of the building to reporters. So far, he has not been given a date by which to enter a plea, and his bail includes $300,000 in cash being lodged with the courts. HSBC has been trying to repair its reputation after a string of hits caused by a variety of controversies, including leaks to the Guardian about tax evasion activities in its Swiss arm. The US authorities still have an official monitor at the bank as part of the terms of a \u00a31.2bn fine in 2012 for a money-laundering scandal. According to a US Congressional report published earlier this month, British officials urged the US not to prosecute HSBC at the time for fear of a \u201cglobal financial disaster\u201d. The DoJ would not say whether it intended to seek the extradition of Scott. Catalogue of HSBC scandals HSBC has incurred almost \u00a310bn in legal bills and fines in the past five years, according to research published earlier this week. While this is not the biggest tally for a UK-based bank, HSBC has been embroiled in a series of scandals that have dented its reputation: A \u00a31.2bn fine in 2012 after the US regulators found it had allowed terrorists to move money around the financial system. A monitor was imposed on the bank to ensure systems changes were made to stop this happening again. This month, a US Congressional report found the UK had intervened to stop the bank being prosecuted for fear of it sparking a \u201cglobal financial disaster\u201d. Last year, the Guardian and other media outlets disclosed that HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets, doling out bundles of untraceable cash and advising clients on how to circumvent domestic tax authorities. Earlier this year, HSBC was found to have created 2,300 companies through the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, although the bank said that only 5% of these companies were still in existence.",

The Aquila drone has the wingspan of an airliner but weighs less than a car. When cruising it consumes just 5,000 watts \u2013 the same as three hairdryers or a powerful microwave. The first flight took place on 28 June in Arizona. Facebook said the test went better than expected and that Aquila\u2019s 96-minute flight was three times longer than planned. Aquila was developed in Bridgwater, Somerset, and the drone, designed to fly non-stop for three months, will use lasers to beam down internet access to remote areas without online capacity. Facebook has a team of engineers at Bridgwater from fields of expertise including aerospace, avionics and software and who had previously worked at organisations such as Nasa, Boeing and the Royal Air Force. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, revealed in March 2015 that the company had been testing drones in the skies over the UK. Facebook intends Aquila to be part of a fleet of planes that will provide the internet to 4 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa and other remote regions that do not have access currently. Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s head of engineering and infrastructure, said in a blog: \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by this first successful flight, but we have a lot of work ahead of us \u2026 In our next tests, we will fly Aquila faster, higher and longer, eventually taking it above 60,000 feet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Obama administration filed two separate lawsuits in hopes of blocking further mergers within the US health insurance market on Thursday. The suits, filed by the US Department of Justice, seek to block Anthem from purchasing Cigna and Aetna from purchasing Humana. Regulators argue the deals would lessen competition and drive up healthcare costs. \u201cBy reducing competition, this proposed merger [between Anthem and Cigna] has the potential to significantly increase the merged firm\u2019s power in the marketplace, to the detriment of consumers,\u201d Eric Schneiderman, attorney general in New York, said in a statement. New York, along with 10 other states and the District of Columbia, has joined the federal complaint. \u201cEmployers will be left with fewer choices, and ultimately consumers could be saddled with higher premium costs, reduced access to providers, and lower-quality care.\u201d Along with UnitedHealth Group, the four insurers form what the US regulators refer to as the \u201cBig Five\u201d \u2013 the five national health insurers. If the mergers were to go through, the number of national health insurers would be reduced to three. When they first announced their mergers a year ago, the health insurers argued that they would be able to lower their prices by expanding their reach. The regulators fear that prices might go up due to reduced competition in several markets. According to the complaint, the $54bn Anthem-Cigna merger alone would reduce competition for large-group employer plans in 35 local markets, including New York City, in which Anthem does business. \u201cIn light of the DoJ\u2019s decision, we do not believe the transaction will close in 2016 and the earliest it could close is 2017, if at all,\u201d Cigna said in a statement on Thursday, noting that it is evaluating its options. Anthem described the lawsuit as as \u201cunfortunate and misguided step backward for access to affordable healthcare for America\u201d. Eight states signed on to the lawsuit seeking to block the $37bn Aetna-Humana merger. The lawsuit alleges that the merger would reduce Medicare Advantage competition in 21 states, affecting more than 1.5 million Medicare Advantage customers. In a joint statement, Aetna and Humana argued that their merger would enable them to expand their Medicare offerings to new regions and that these offerings will be of greater quality and cost less. \u201cThe facts do not support the basis for DoJ action,\u201d they said in a statement, arguing that the new company would only serve 8% of total Medicare beneficiaries. These mergers may increase profits for Aetna and Anthem at the expense of consumers and employers, who provide health coverage, said the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch. \u201cIf the \u2018Big Five\u2019 were to become the \u2018Big Three\u2019, not only the bank accounts of the American people would suffer \u2013 but also the American people themselves,\u201d she argued. Barack Obama has also taken issue with limited competition in the health insurance market. Earlier this month, he published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association noting that the US government could increase the competition in the marketplace by creating a government-run or public health insurance option. \u201cMore can and should be done to enhance competition in the Marketplaces,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cPublic programs like Medicare often deliver care more cost effectively by curtailing administrative overhead and securing better prices from providers. The public plan didn\u2019t make it into the final legislation. Now, based on experience with the Affordable Care Act, I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Guardian is naive to think that Openreach would become a public service entity if split away from BT (Editorial, 20 July). The current government has spent much effort \u201cselling the family silver\u201d by privatising \u2013 or attempting to privatise \u2013 state assets at a rate of knots, including profit-making operations such as the Land Registry. BT\u2019s rivals have been clamouring to take control of Openreach without demonstrating how customers (as opposed to their own shareholders) would benefit. We believe improvements can and should be made to the way in which Openreach is run but this does not happen in a bubble. For example, there are drawbacks to the demand-led approach to the universal service obligation, as economies of scale mean that it is generally more cost effective to roll out broadband access to a number of premises in one area simultaneously and this approach inevitably disadvantages rural areas with low populations. Quality of service is also affected by the current regulatory model, which focuses almost solely on pricing. The focus has to be about quality of service and stimulating investment, ensuring a properly resourced workforce to build and maintain network infrastructure to a high standard. No one would welcome a public service broadband provider more than my union. However, with the future of 28,000 Openreach staff we represent in the balance, we want to see a direction that is well-resourced, puts service for customers at its heart, and is also practically deliverable. We believe BT ownership \u2013 with improvements \u2013 best meets that ambition.

The current government has spent much effort \u201cselling the family silver\u201d by privatising \u2013 or attempting to privatise \u2013 state assets at a rate of knots, including profit-making operations such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/24/land-registry-faces-privatisation\" title=\"\">Land Registry</a>. BT\u2019s rivals have been clamouring to take control of Openreach without demonstrating how customers (as opposed to their own shareholders) would benefit.</p> <p>We believe improvements can and should be made to the way in which Openreach is run but this does not happen in a bubble. For example, there are drawbacks to the demand-led approach to the universal service obligation, as economies of scale mean that it is generally more cost effective to roll out broadband access to a number of premises in one area simultaneously and this approach inevitably disadvantages rural areas with low populations. Quality of service is also affected by the current regulatory model, which focuses almost solely on pricing. The focus has to be about quality of service and stimulating investment, ensuring a properly resourced workforce to build and maintain network infrastructure to a high standard.</p> <p>No one would welcome a public service broadband provider more than my union. However, with the future of 28,000 Openreach staff we represent in the balance, we want to see a direction that is well-resourced, puts service for customers at its heart, and is also practically deliverable.

      "bodyText": "The maker of Flora margarine, Magnum ice-cream and Dove soap has become the first major food and consumer goods company to warn that prices could rise for UK shoppers as a result of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, said companies could be forced to increase the price of products to offset the fall in the value of sterling against the dollar and euro. \u201cAnybody who is importing things from Europe \u2013 raw materials, not only finished products \u2013 will have to eventually reflect that pricing because you not going to go down in profitability and go out of business,\u201d Polman said. The boss of Unilever, which also produces Lynx deodorant and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream, said it was too early to tell which consumer categories would be the worst affected. \u201cThe manufacturers decide pricing [the recommended retail price], Brexit alone doesn\u2019t decide pricing. But if you have a 15% decline in your currency relative to the euro, then you have a higher cost base,\u201d Polman said. \u201cSo we need to look at that by categories. If you import products it is more susceptible than if you locally produce, it depends on the mix of ingredients that are in there. \u201cBefore Brexit I was saying that if you have a brand like Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s the prices goes up. Now we are sitting here, the currency has gone done 15%. Are we going to sell this at a loss in the UK? Most likely not. So someone has to pay for this [Brexit]. It is quite something.\u201d Unilever is one of the biggest companies in the world. It employs 175,000 people, including 7,500 in the UK across its headquarters in London, two research and development centres, and 10 factories. Polman said the company\u2019s UK investments were not immediately under threat, but warned that the uncertainty about the terms on which the country leaves the EU were \u201chaunting\u201d businesses and new investments had halted. He added: \u201cWe have 10 factories here and many of them supply Europe. So if import barriers are going to be erected, that is going to be an uncertainty. Is someone going to make an investment decision when you have that uncertainty now, when you don\u2019t know where you are going? Highly unlikely.\u201d Before the referendum, Polman and his predecessors, Patrick Cescau and Niall FitzGerald, wrote to Unilever\u2019s staff to tell them that the company had benefited from the UK being in the EU and it would be \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d by a vote to leave. Polman, who is Dutch, said it was a \u201cstrange situation\u201d in the UK because \u201cpeople have have voted against something not fully understanding where they want to go\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what the direction is that the country is going to take. So that will be an enormous insecurity for many companies [looking] to invest in the UK. Other countries, particularly European countries, will benefit from that,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s origins date to 1885 when William and James Lever created Sunlight, the world\u2019s first branded and packaged soap for washing clothes. Unilever was formed in 1930 when Lever Brothers merged with the Dutch margarine maker Margarine Unie. Polman was speaking as Unilever reported a 4.7% year-on-year rise in comparable sales during the first half of 2016. However, currency fluctuations, particularly in emerging markets, meant revenues fell 2.6% to \u20ac2.6bn (\u00a32.2bn). Pre-tax profits rose 0.8% to \u20ac3.6bn.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s inclement weather rather than the EU referendum put the damper on consumer spending last month as sales of clothes and shoes slumped during a wet June. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that high street chains were left with racks of unsold dresses, short-sleeved shirts and sandals during the period leading to and immediately after the Brexit vote. The ONS said the volume of retail sales decreased by 0.9% between May and June after a rise of the same magnitude between April and May. The figures provided the first hard evidence of the state of the economy since the referendum since they include retail sales in the five-week period from 29 May to 2 July. But although the fall was larger than the 0.6% drop expected, the decline was particularly marked in the clothing and footwear sector, where volumes in June were almost 2% down on those recorded in May. Over the three months to June, retail sales volumes were 1.6% higher than in the previous quarter. The ONS said over the year to June every sector of retailing had enjoyed sales growth apart from clothing and footwear. Melanie Richard, ONS head of retail sales, said: \u201cAll types of stores showed growth in June with the exception of clothing and footwear, which struggled again due to the changeable weather. But department stores continued to see strong sales compared with last June \u2013 boosted by events such as Father\u2019s Day, the Euro 2016 football and the Queen\u2019s official birthday.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cRetail sales fell back appreciably in June. This seemingly had little to do with the Brexit vote. \u201cSome correction in retail sales was always likely in June after they had seen very strong growth in May and April and there was also a significant falling back in clothing sales due to unhelpful weather. The Office for National Statistics indicated that retailers had not given any evidence of the Brexit vote having a major dampening impact.\u201d Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, received mixed news from the latest snapshot of Britain\u2019s public finances, released separately by the ONS. The data showed that the Government borrowed less than expected in June alone but was off target to hit its deficit-reduction target for the first three months of the 2016-17 financial year. The ONS said public borrowing in June stood at \u00a37.8bn, compared with \u00a310bn in the same month last year and the \u00a39.5bn predicted by the City. Hammond said the smallest June deficit since June 2007 \u2013 shortly before the onset of the financial crisis that prompted the biggest contraction of the economy since the second world war \u2013 showed that the economy was in good shape to cope with the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But the ONS figures showed that deficit reduction in the first three months of the 2016-17 financial year was slower than forecast in George Osborne\u2019s March budget. Osborne envisaged borrowing being cut by about a quarter in the current year. But during the first three months of the financial year, slow growth in tax receipts meant there was an improvement of just over 8%. Analysts said there would be less good news on the public finances in the second half of 2016, since the decision to leave the EU would lead to slower growth and weaker public finances.",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has adopted a wait-and-see approach to the UK\u2019s Brexit decision and will wait for at least another six weeks before deciding whether it needs to boost growth in the eurozone. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, said his staff would \u201ccontinue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely\u201d but gave no clues as to what the bank might do. Financial markets had not expected any action from the ECB but saw Draghi\u2019s comment that the bank had a \u201creadiness, willingness and ability\u201d to act as a clear sign that further stimulus was on the way. The ECB president said over the coming months his organisation would be in a better position to assess the state of the eurozone economy and the impact of Brexit on growth and inflation. Draghi added that, if warranted, the ECB would use all the \u201cinstruments available within its mandate\u201d, leaving open the possibility of fresh cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its quantitative easing (QE) programme. Following the example of the Bank of England, the ECB made no changes to policy at the first meeting of its governing council since the UK\u2019s referendum, leaving interest rates unchanged and deciding to continue to buy \u20ac80bn (\u00a367bn) of assets a month under its QE programme. Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM investor services, said Draghi had given a \u201cmasterclass in stonewalling\u201d at a press conference to explain the ECB\u2019s lack of action. \u201cOverall, Draghi appeared to be very determined to say nothing of any significance. To be fair, he and the rest of the council have stressed for a number of months that the existing package of policy measures must be given time to work, and that an assessment of whether there might be a need to do more would not happen before the September meeting and staff forecast update,\u201d he said. \u201cThus the message was that the ECB is \u2018ready, willing and able\u2019 to act \u2018if needed\u2019, while stressing that risks are to the downside of their forecasts, to underline a dovish bias.\u201d Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the eurozone. With post-Brexit evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting before extending its QE timetable. \u201cInflation remains far below the ECB\u2019s target of 2% and while headline inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in the new ECB staff forecasts.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet has said it is facing one of the most difficult periods in memory as multiple terrorist attacks, industrial action and uncertainty following the Brexit vote blight the airline sector. The budget airline said weak consumer confidence and an unusually high level of disruption to flights was making it difficult to predict how the business would fare in the coming months. EasyJet was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on morning trading, down 6% at one point. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive, said events affecting the industry were developing on a daily basis, citing Turkey\u2019s decision on Wednesday to declare a state of emergency, following a failed coup attempt. \u201cThere are so many moving parts. There are more terrorist events than in any years anyone can remember, air traffic control action, and the devaluation of the pound on top of that. All of that has an impact on consumer confidence. It is one of the most difficult environments we have seen in a very long time.\u201d McCall said consumers\u2019 willingness to fly tended to diminish rapidly in the immediate aftermath of terrorist events such as the attack in Nice last week. \u201cYou see demand fall immediately. It does recover but it can take weeks,\u201d she said. The sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has pushed costs up by \u00a340m, according to McCall, largely because fuel is priced in the stronger US dollar. She made the comments as easyJet published a trading update for the third quarter. The airline said cancellations have been much higher than usual because of a combination of strike action, poor weather, runway closures at Gatwick and air traffic congestion. A total of 1,221 flights were cancelled over the period, a 70% increase on the same period a year earlier. Revenue over the quarter fell by 2.6% to \u00a31.2bn, partly because of the high number of cancellations and increased competition on short haul routes. Revenue per seat fell by 7.7% to \u00a354.54. The number of passengers carried on easyJet flights increased by 5.8% to 20.2 million. McCall said the outlook remained uncertain: \u201cThe economic and operating environment remains uncertain, following the high levels of disruption and more recently the UK\u2019s referendum decision to leave the EU, as well as the recent events in Turkey and Nice, which have affected consumer confidence. \u201cThis combined with industry capacity growth in short haul continues to have an impact on industry yields at a peak time of year.\u201d EasyJet said it had a team in place to hold talks with regulators and governments to secure European flying rights following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The airline added it had \u201ca well-developed\u201d contingency plan to obtain an EU airline operator certificate. McCall stressed this would only be pursued \u201cout of necessity, not choice\u201d, should the UK government fail to secure an agreement that ensured the continuation of a liberalised and deregulated aviation market. \u201cEasyJet remains committed to the UK, its largest single market,\u201d the company said. The airline has secured 65% of expected bookings for the fourth quarter, with average revenue per seat for the quarter down by around 7.5%. \u201cAs a result of events in the last week the revenue per seat trajectory in the fourth quarter remains uncertain,\u201d it cautioned. The German airline Lufthansa cut its full-year profit target on Wednesday, saying advanced bookings on long-haul routes to Europe had fallen sharply \u201cdue to repeated terrorist attacks in Europe and to greater political and economic uncertainty\u201d. The company said it expected full-year underlying earnings to fall in 2016, having previously expected them to come in just above the previous year.",

    "webTitle": "Mario Draghi's ECB press conference after leaving rates on hold - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That wasn\u2019t the most dramatic or exciting press conference in the European Central Bank\u2019s 18 year history. Instead, there was a real end-of-term feeling, as Mario Draghi basically told reporters to come back in September and see if the ECB has decided to boost its stimulus programme. Given some of the dramas we\u2019ve seen in recent years, a dull ECB meeting should be welcomed (as long as it doesn\u2019t become a habit, Mario). So what did we learn? 1) The ECB isn\u2019t panicking about Brexit yet, although it believes it is a risk to the recovery. Draghi struck a pretty reassuring tone, declaring that: Following the UK referendum on EU membership, our assessment is that euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience.... What is clear is that financial markets and the banking sector have reacted in a fairly resilient fashion to the event.We haven\u2019t observed any disruption either in financial markets or the banking sector.\u201d 2) Assessing the full impact of Brexit will take some time. That\u2019s why the ECB didn\u2019t launch any new stimulus measures today. Over the coming months when we have more information including new staff projections we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess the underlying macroeconomic conditions. 3) Draghi has given eurozone politicians a nudge to provide more financial support for the banking sector. The most interesting part of the press conference, I think, was Draghi\u2019s comments about the non-performing loans which bedevil Europe\u2019s banks, notably in Italy. More than once he hinted that a public backstop is needed to help banks shift their non-performing loans. Draghi warned that these NPLs are threatening the recovery: \u201cThe longer we have this (non-performing loan problem) in place, the less functioning will be the banking system, or at least will be the banks with high NPLs. And so the less capable will be these banks to transmit our monetary policy impulses to the real economy. Also, a high level of NPLs makes banks especially vulnerable to the markets.\u201d This chart shows that Southern European countries need help the most: 4) We might get fireworks in September. Draghi insisted that the ECB has the \u201creadiness, willingness and ability\u201d to take fresh action, if needed, to stimulate the economy. By September, the ECB will have fresh economic forecasts - and a better idea of Britain\u2019s Brexit plans. 5) QE might be tweaked soon. Economists are pretty confident that the ECB needs to adjust the rules of its asset-purchase scheme, to allow it to buy more bonds from individual companies. Draghi was adamant that the ECB won\u2019t run out of things to buy, saying: \u201cIn the past we\u2019ve given enough evidence ... of our ability to adapt our purchases to reach 80 billion euros a month until March 2017 or beyond.\u201d That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Trevor Charsley of currency trading firm AFEX says Draghi\u2019s comments show we\u2019ve entered a \u2018phoney war\u2019 following the EU referendum. \u201cIn commenting that there was no Brexit induced disruption apparent in the banking sector, Draghi was merely confirming that, after a knee jerk reaction in the markets immediately following the EU referendum, we have effectively entered a period of limbo or a \u2018phoney war\u2019 while we await more economic data, while political decisions are made and holidays taken. This situation could last for several months, he adds: As we receive the announcement of a plan from the UK government, a few months of post-Brexit economic data and a potential triggering of Article 50, the fog will begin to clear and we\u2019ll see then how the central banks respond Mario Draghi\u2019s call for a public backstop to help banks shed their bad loans has sparked a small rally in bank shares. Reuters has the details: Deutsche Bank shares, which opened flat, rose 3% following Draghi\u2019s comments. The FTSE Italian All Shares Banks index rose nearly 2%. The broader euro zone banking index rose 1.7%. Traders are calculating that Draghi\u2019s intervention could help struggling eurozone banks to shift their bad loans, which are dragging them down and hurting confidence and profitability. Mario Draghi\u2019s introductory statement is now online here. And here\u2019s a word cloud of it: Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is quick out of the traps with some reaction to the ECB\u2019s meeting: While we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the Eurozone. With post-Brexit evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting before extending its QE timetable. Inflation remains far below the ECB\u2019s target of 2% and while headline inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in the new ECB staff forecasts. Final question.... Q: European bank shares are at record lows, so is there a fundamental lack of confidence in the eurozone banking sector? Draghi says that the problem is about the future profitability of banks, not their solvency. That\u2019s partly due to concerns about non-performing loans (which is why Draghi is pushing for a new market for them to be traded). But he is confident that this situation, and the perception in the rest of the world\u2019s eyes, can be improved. And that\u2019s it Now we\u2019re DEEP into conspiracy territory... Q: Your son is a bond dealer in London, Mr Draghi, so isn\u2019t that a conflict of interest? Draghi says that he explained five year ago that his son was a trader, not a bond dealer, so there is no conflict of interest. The European Parliament agreed at the time. OK, we\u2019re wandering into conspiracy territory now, with a journalist asking Draghi if the ECB is committed to using notes and coins as sole legal tender. Yes. Of course. There is, says Draghi, looking a little puzzled. Q: So why did you bury the \u20ac500 note? We didn\u2019t bury it, Draghi says. We decided to stop printing it from 2018 to stop it being used by criminals. Q: Could you elaborate on your comments that a public backstop is needed for banks with non-performing loans? Draghi says that such a backstop would be \u201cvery useful\u201d, but it should be agreed with the Commission. The bad debts in Italy\u2019s banking sector are a \u201cvery big problem\u201d and it will take time to address them - as it has taken time in other countries, Draghi continues. But the situation needs to be tackled, as: The longer we have this in place, the less functioning will be the banking sector - and less effective the banks will be at transmitting our monetary policy. The idea of a public backstop is likely to go down badly in Germany, which doesn\u2019t like to see taxpayers on the hook for bank losses. Draghi is asked about the ECB\u2019s presence in the \u201ctroika\u201d which oversees eurozone bailouts. He says it\u2019s not his decision; it\u2019s due to legislation passed by the European Parliament which wanted its expertise involved. The eurozone now has more expertise, but MEPs would have to pass new legislation if they want to get the ECB out of the Troika. Francesco Papadia, a former senior ECB policymaker, reckons Draghi wants out: Q: What impact will the political crisis in Turkey have on the eurozone recovery? It\u2019s very difficult to understand how these big geo-political issues will affect the economy, Draghi replies. It\u2019s not obvious how they would be channeled into the euro economy. At least with Brexit you have the trade channel - although that may not be the best thing to look at. With Turkey, it\u2019s hard to see an immediate near-term hit to the euro recovery, he concludes, although it is likely to hurt confidence. Q: What message would you like to hear from G20 finance ministers and central bankers when they meet in Shanghai later this week? We need to hear a message of stability, Draghi replies. Banks and financial institutions are much stronger than before the last financial crisis. The euro has jumped by half a cent as investors react to Mario Draghi\u2019s straight bat to all tantalising questions about future stimulus plans. Hmmmm this might be interesting. Draghi has dangled the idea that governments should step in, if needed, to protect a bank that needs to sell non-performing loans. This would avoid the risk of \u201cfiresales\u201d, in which a bank is forced to sell assets at a big loss. That\u2019s pertinent in Draghi\u2019s homeland of Italy right now, as the government tries to find a way to strengthen its banks without breaching EU rules. Q: How much damage will Brexit do to eurozone growth? Does Draghi believe that estimates of 0.2%-0.5% knocked off the growth rate are accurate? We should take such estimates with a grain of caution, the ECB president replies. It is too early to see the financial impact, and we needs to wait and see the eventual outcome of the vote. Draghi then repeats that eurozone markets have been \u201cfairly resilient\u201d since the vote on June 23. We haven\u2019t seen any disruption in the banking sector or the financial sector, he says, which is testament to the contingency measures drawn up by policymakers and the large amounts of liquidity available. Europe\u2019s banks are in better shape than in 2009, Draghi declares, partly thanks to the ECB\u2019s efforts to strengthen the sector and boost solvency. He then embarks on a long explanation about the need to tackle non-performing loans (NPLs) to improve bank profitability. Important stuff, but not the fireworks we might have hoped for: Twenty minutes into this press conference, and there\u2019s no sign that Draghi is going to pull a rabbit out of his hat. It appears that the ECB wants everyone to go away and come back in September. Q: Could the ECB have already done enough to stimulate the economy and support inflation expectations? Draghi says there is a difference between public surveys of inflation expectations, and the market-based expectations. Surveys of professional forecasts show that inflation will increase....close to the ECB\u2019s targets in the medium term, but market expectations suggest investors are rather more pessimistic. And he repeats that the governing council believes it is too early to agree new measures at today\u2019s meeting. However, he insists that the ECB has the readyness, willingness, and ability to act, if needed. Onto questions: Q: Did the ECB consider changing the terms of its asset-purchase scheme, to avoid it running out of government bonds to buy? Draghi repeats that the ECB believes it is too early to assess the need for fresh measures, so it will consider the situation at its next meeting in September. There wasn\u2019t any real discussion about the details of such changes, he adds. As usual, Draghi is urging eurozone politicians to step up the pace of structural reforms, to improve their business environment. He suggests that governments could boost infrastructure projects, to increase employment and investment. Fiscal policies should also support the recovery, he adds -- a hint to governments to spend more (without breaching eurozone deficit rules). All countries should strive for a more \u201cgrowth-friendly\u201d mix of fiscal policies, Draghi concludes (a message we have heard several times...) The eurozone recovery faces several headwinds, and the risks remain tilted to the downside, says Draghi. He cites the UK referendum, slowing emerging markets and the slow pace of structural reforms as key threats to the recovery. Draghi says the eurozone recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, but will have slowed in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year. President Draghi begins by confirming that the governing council left the key interest rates unchanged, and expects them to stay at present or lower levels for some time. He confirms that the ECB plans to run its asset purchase scheme at \u20ac80bn per month until at least March 2017, or longer if needed to bring inflation back to target. Then he turns to Brexit, saying markets have coped relatively well: Following the UK referendum, euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in volatility with encouraging resilience. But given the uncertainties, the ECB will monitor market developments closely. And Draghi then drops a clear hint that he could announce new stimulus measures soon, declaring: If warranted.... the governing council will act by using all the instruments available under its mandate. Mario Draghi has arrived in the press conference room in Frankfurt, and is posing for a few photos with colleagues. And we\u2019re off...... Here\u2019s a live feed of Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which starts in 5 minutes (I\u2019ll try to embed it at the top of this blog too) Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets says the ECB was right to leave interest rates unchanged today while it gauges the impact of the Brexit vote: There was no smoke from the ECB\u2019s gun as the bank has decided to hold its fire as expected. Perhaps, it was the best move because the bank certainly wants to assess the consequences of Brexit which has triggered the need for more QE and dragged the bond yields in negative territory. Aslam also warns that the markets could slide if central banks don\u2019t deliver the stimulus which investors expect: The market is addicted to this medicine and most of the boom which we have experienced in the equity market is based on the basis of this cheap funding. If these liquidity tanks start to run dry, we may start to see the heavy sell off which many have been waiting for.... More reaction: Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the ECB\u2019s announcement, and predictions about what we might hear from Mario Draghi in 30 minutes: The European Central Bank has declared that it expects interest rates to remain at their current record lows, or lower, for a long time. It has also confirmed that its quantitative easing bond-buying programme will run until at least next March. That\u2019s not a change of policy \u2013 however, it\u2019s unusual to see it spelled out explicitly in the monetary policy announcement. We don\u2019t normally get quite as much information at 12.45pm. Here\u2019s the full statement from Frankfurt: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the monthly asset purchases of \u20ac80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged across the eurozone. Despite the uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s EU referendum, the governing council has decided not to take any immediate steps. That means the headline rate remains at zero, while banks will continue to be charged 0.4% for leaving money in the ECB\u2019s vaults. Danae Kyriakopoulou of the Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that Mario Draghi will hint at another stimulus boost after the summer hols. If that happens, then the euro might spike in 15 minutes, and then dip once Draghi\u2019s press conference begin. There are just 30 minutes to go, until the ECB announces its monetary policy decision. Reminder, economists are currently expecting no change to the current rates, which are: Headline interest rate: 0.0% The deposit rate (paid by commercial banks who leave money at the ECB): - 0.4% The marginal lending facility (charged to banks who borrow from the ECB): +0.25%. Nordea Markets analyst Aurelija Augulyte points out that a surprise can\u2019t be ruled out..... Investors have paid to lend money to Spain for the next three years, for the first time ever: It\u2019s a sign of the nervousness in the markets, with investors keen to put money into safe-haven government debt. It\u2019s also a consequences of Mario Draghi\u2019s bond-buying programme, which has helped drive down bond yields to record lows. Whoever bought these bonds could theoretically sell them onto the ECB at a profit (the lower-threshold for bond purchases is -0.4% yield). There\u2019s more on the ECB\u2019s agenda than Britain\u2019s EU referendum, says FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga: Although Brexit remains the biggest risk threatening Eurozone\u2019s recovery, there are more challenges to be addressed when the central bank meets later today, such as the troubled Italian banks and the plunging yields on governments\u2019 debt which makes it difficult for the ECB to pursue its \u20ac80 billion monthly debt purchases without amending the terms of their program. He also expects no fresh action today, especially as the ECB has already boosted its stimulus programme once this year. That will leave the scene clear for Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: Mr. Draghi\u2019s only tool is likely to be his dovish words on opening the door for further easing if economic conditions deteriorate. European stock markets have all lost ground this morning, as investors wait to hear from ECB president Mario Draghi. The main indices are down around 0.5%: City investors expect reassuring words from Draghi at his press conference, at 1.30pm BST. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: The relatively shallow pullback seen in eurozone markets this morning would seem to indicate a calm atmosphere \u2013 given the myriad problems facing the eurozone, and indeed the UK and EU, it seems highly likely that Mario Draghi will seek to soothe frayed nerves with a generally dovish statement. More from Jack Lew in Athens: From Brexit to Grexit... Over in Athens, US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has urged the Greek government to stick with its bailout plan. Lew says Greece needs to deliver the privatisation plans and economic reforms agreed with its creditors, so it can unlock the next loan tranche this autumn. Sounding like a man who doesn\u2019t fancy another Greek bailout crisis, Lew declared: \u201cPutting Greece\u2019s debt on a sustainable path is critical to Greece\u2019s long-term economic health and I encourage all parties to be flexible to successfully conclude this fall\u2019s negotiations.\u201d Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy, Swissquote Bank, also predicts that the European Central Bank will leave its powder dry today. He expects monetary policy will be unchanged, while president Mario Draghi will probably hint at stimulus measures later this year: With the true extent of the Brexit effect still unclear, and the Euro on the weaker side (due to renewed expectations for a September Fed rate hike), the central bank is under no real pressure to act. Draghi will therefore most likely adopt a wait-and-see approach. We expect the meeting and press conference to contain warnings that economic downside risks have grown and that the bank remains ready to ease monetary policy further, if necessary. The Economist Intelligence Unit concurs: Britain\u2019s new chancellor, Philip Hammond, has welcomed the \u00a32.2bn drop in UK public borrowing last month: \u201cThese public finance figures highlight the underlying strength of the British economy. Ahead of the referendum monthly borrowing continued to fall, with the deficit in June the lowest it has been since 2007. \u201cAs our economy now adjusts to reflect the referendum decision it is clear we will do so from a position of economic strength.\u201d This chart shows how Britain is expecting to borrow around \u00a355bn in the 2016-17 financial year, although the Brexit vote could shake that plan.... Here\u2019s a great preview of today\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, from Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group. The European Central Bank (ECB) delivers its first monetary policy verdict after the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. At his press conference, the ECB\u2019s President Mario Draghi is expected to comment on Brexit, on low-to-negative sovereign rates in the Eurozone as a result of an out-of-control appetite post-Brexit and the crisis in the Italian banking sector. The ECB is expected to maintain the status quo at today\u2019s meeting. September\u2019s meeting could signal more monetary stimulus, according to consensus. Not the size but rather duration of the ECB\u2019s Quantitative Easing (QE) programme, as well as the composition of its portfolio are expected to be the major talking points. The ECB is currently buying \u20ac80bn of government and corporate bonds each month. As mentioned earlier, it could run out of things to buy, having pushed up prices and absorbed so much debt already. Ipek says liquidity in eligible bonds in the Eurozone sovereign complex is \u201cdangerously drying up\u201d. As of today, $3.2 trillion worth of Eurozone bonds are yielding below zero; 60% of eligible German bond yields are below the ECB\u2019s deposit rate of -0.40%, which is also defined as the lower limit for the ECB purchases. Digging a bit deeper, the abnormally low sovereign rates could, according to many, push the ECB towards the limits of its bond buying programme sooner rather than later. This gif shows how many eurozone bonds are now priced outside the ECB\u2019s remit (because their prices are so high, pushing the interest rate on the bonds deep into negative territory) We also have new UK government borrowing figures.....which show that Britain borrowed \u00a37.8bn to balance the books in June. That\u2019s \u00a32.2bn less than in June 2015, and the smallest figures for any June since 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck). Breaking: UK retail sales have fallen at their fastest pace since last December. Bad weather, rather than Brexit, appears to be to blame. The volume of stuff bought in the shops fell by 0.9% in June, the Office for National Statistics reports, worse than the 0.6% drop which economists expected. The amount of stuff bought from retailers also fell by 0.9%. It\u2019s mainly due to another fall in clothing sales, as bad weather in June deterred shoppers from buying new outfits. The ONS also flags up that retail prices have kept falling over the last year, helping to keep inflation close to zero: all store types except textile, clothing and footwear stores showed increases in the quantity bought compared with June 2015 all store types saw falls in average store price compared with June 2015; the largest fall was shown in petrol stations. It says that retailers didn\u2019t report any anecdotal evidence that the Brexit vote had hurt spending. But these figure are weaker than expected, so.... The Daily Mail was a big supporter of the Brexit campaign. But now that the victory is in the bag, its parent company says it\u2019s suffering as nervous advertisers wonder what the future holds: Budget airline easyJet has spooked the travel sector with a gloomy financial update and a warning that the Brexit vote will hurt demand. Shares in easyJet have slid by 4.4% this morning, to the bottom of the FTSE 100, after it posted a 2.6% drop in sales in the last three months. It blamed poor weather and air traffic control strikes. CEO Carolyn McCall warned that this summer could be challenging, as the recent fall in sterling makes it more expensive for Brits to holiday abroad. She also cited last week\u2019s failed Turkish coup and the latest French terror attacks: Currency volatility as a result of the U.K.\u2019s referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence.\u201d Anthony Cheung of Amplify Trading flags up the key issues on the ECB\u2019s agenda today: The third point is important \u2013 basically, the ECB is running short of some government bonds to buy, having mopped up so many already. German bunds is in particularly short supply, due to the current limits which prevent the ECB buying more than 33% of a country\u2019s debt. Naeem Aslam of ThinkMarkets UK explains why a change may be needed: The Bundesbank needs to purchase 253 billion euros of debt by the end of this month, but due to the present issuer limit of 33%, the world of eligible assets stand at 216 billion euros. It will be a big surprise if the ECB launches new stimulus measures today, rather than waiting until its next meeting in September: The boss of William Hill has been abruptly dismounted from his position at the bookmaker. CEO James Henderson\u2019s unexpected departurture was announced to the City this morning. He has paid the price for its disappointing online performance, which has hit profits recently. It\u2019s a glum end to his 31-year career at the bookmaker. Analysts at Danske Bank also predict that the ECB will resist the temptation to launch new stimulus measures today. They predict that it will boost its bond-buying QE programme in September, when they\u2019ll have new forecasts and a better picture of the Brexit impact. Brexit is a double whammy for the European Central Bank. As well as generating economic uncertainty, it could create more political instability in the eurozone. Florian Hense, economist at German bank Berenberg, explains why it\u2019s a difficult time for the ECB: Political risks loom unusually large, and the British vote on exiting the EU exemplifies the danger which the surge in anti-establishment sentiment presents. Investment could contract, while private consumption growth will slow. Recent attacks in Nice and the attempted coup d\u2019etat in Turkey could further weigh on confidence. Hense expects that the ECB will leave monetary policy unchanged today. The press pack are already gathering in Frankfurt, where Bloomberg\u2019s inflatable euro looks like it needs a holiday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s ECB Day! Investors around the world are looking to Frankfurt as the European Central Bank meets to set monetary policy, and discuss the latest political and economic crises on its patch, and beyond. This is the first ECB meeting since Britain voted to leave the European Union, so the governing council must consider how to protect the eurozone economy from the Brexit fallout. It\u2019s probably too early for them to cut interest rates, or to boost the existing stimulus programme. But Mario Draghi\u2019s comments at this afternoon\u2019s press conference should give insights into the ECB\u2019s plans to avoid Europe\u2019s recovery being derailed. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons Draghi will take his cue from the Bank of England, which left interest rates on hold last week: Today\u2019s focus will be the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) latest monetary policy update from which no change is anticipated but any hints/forward guidance will be much appreciated by markets regarding further stimulus being required in light of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. With the BoE having held off this month saying it was too early to react to Brexit, its continental peer may well strike a similar tone today. Here\u2019s the key timings: ECB interest rate/stimulus decision: 12.45pm BST (1.45pm Frankfurt) President Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: 1.30pm BST (2.30pm Frankfurt) Policymakers also need to talk about Italy\u2019s banks, as the struggle to bail out Monte dei Paschi di Siena continues. Prime minister Matteo Renzi is still trying to find a way to pump money into Italy\u2019s third-largest lender, without breaching EU rules blocking state aid. According to the Financial Times today, Renzi has a cunning plan... Rather than inject state money directly into Monte Paschi as originally planned, Italy is exploring ways to buyout its bad loans at favourable rates with money from private and state-backed institutions. This would use the existing privately backed fund, called Atlante, and would not need preapproval from Brussels. The terms of any intervention, however, would be closely watched by Brussels to ensure it involves no hidden state support More here: Italy eyes private deal to bail out bank Draghi is a former Bank of Italy governor, so his views on this innovative scheme could be interesting... Meanwhile in the UK, we get the latest retail sales figures at 9.30am. They\u2019ll show if consumer spending took a hit from Brexit uncertainty in June. Yesterday, the Bank of England reported that the economy doesn\u2019t appear to have suffered a slowdown since last month\u2019s vote. On the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from drinks chains SAB Miller and Britvic, media group Daily Mail and General Trust, consumer group Unilever, budget airline easyJet, and online white goods group AO World. And Europe\u2019s financial markets are likely to remain calm, at least until Mario takes his seat....",

So what did we learn?</p> <p><strong>1) The ECB isn\u2019t panicking about Brexit yet, although it believes it is a risk to the recovery.</strong></p> <p>Draghi struck a pretty reassuring tone, declaring that:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the UK referendum on EU membership, our assessment is that euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience....</p> <p>What is clear is that financial markets and the banking sector have reacted in a fairly resilient fashion to the event.We haven\u2019t observed any disruption either in financial markets or the banking sector.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) Assessing the full impact of Brexit will take some time. That\u2019s why the ECB didn\u2019t launch any new stimulus measures today.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the coming months when we have more information including new staff projections we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess the underlying macroeconomic conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3) Draghi has given eurozone politicians a nudge to provide more financial support for the banking sector.</strong></p> <p>The most interesting part of the press conference, I think, was Draghi\u2019s comments about the non-performing loans which bedevil Europe\u2019s banks, notably in Italy. More than once he hinted that a public backstop is needed to help banks shift their non-performing loans.</p> <p>Draghi warned that these NPLs are threatening the recovery:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe longer we have this (non-performing loan problem) in place, the less functioning will be the banking system, or at least will be the banks with high NPLs.</p> <p>And so the less capable will be these banks to transmit our monetary policy impulses to the real economy.

Paul Pester, chief executive of the Spanish-owned bank, said that after an initial dip, mortgage activity resumed a few days after the referendum result. He said that customer behaviour had altered more when England were playing during the Euro 2016 football tournament. \u201cWe saw some people for a few days cancel some mortgage appointments,\u201d said Pester. The referendum result was announced on Friday 24 June and \u201cby the Tuesday it was coming back to normal\u201d. The self-styled challenger bank was created in 2013 when Lloyds Banking Group spun out 600 branches to meet a demand from the EU imposed in relation to its 2008 taxpayer bailout. TSB was floated on the stock market before being bought last year by the Spanish bank Sabadell. Pester has urged the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 whose final report on competition in banking is due by 12 August \u2013 to adopt proposals that would make it easier for customers to know how much they were paying for a bank account. He said he was concerned that Brexit could distract from attempts to boost competition on the high street at a time when the number of customers switching accounts across they industry had fallen 10%. \u201cWhat I\u2019m nervous about is that the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote will refocus policymakers on negotiating the exit and will take their eye off the ball in the reform of banking,\u201d said Pester. He had exceeded his goal to attract 6% of all current accounts switchers, taking a 7% share in the first six months of the year. Profits in the first half rose 440% to \u00a3125m, bolstered by the acquisition last year of \u00a33.3bn of mortgages from Northern Rock. But Pester said the pace of profit growth was likely to slow down. He pointed to the impact of continued low interest rates and a rising bill for the use of Lloyds\u2019 IT systems, which would have \u201ca bearing on the financial performance in future periods\u201d. The share prices of other banks attempting to challenge the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 have been battered since the Brexit vote.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s plans to hire 900 staff for its online business and launch same-day deliveries from 30 stores by Christmas, as part of a fightback against Amazon\u2019s assault on supermarkets. The company will begin recruiting the first 470 staff for its first online service centre, sometimes referred to as a \u201cdark store\u201d, in Bromley-by-Bow, east London. The 185,000 sq ft centre is due to open this autumn and expected to employ 900 people by 2020. The facility, housed in a former Royal Mail building, will be able to fulfil 25,000 orders a week, taking the pressure off Sainsbury\u2019s stores in London, which also handle the picking and packing of online grocery orders, and are struggling to keep up with the growth in demand in the capital. The deal comes as Sainsbury\u2019s prepares to finalise its takeover of Argos owner Home Retail Group this autumn, which the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has said will help accelerate the supermarket\u2019s strategy to improve online services. Traditional supermarkets are having to up their game online as Amazon launches a host of grocery services in the UK. Last month, it started Amazon Fresh, which offers same-day fresh food deliveries in parts of London for those signed up to the Amazon Prime subscription service. The service came about after Amazon agreed to source goods from Morrisons and began selling frozen foods through its Prime Now one-hour delivery service last year. Tesco is also trialling same-day delivery in a few locations, but other operators do not offer as quick a service as Amazon. Under Sainsbury\u2019s same-day delivery trial, shoppers who order by 12pm in Streatham Common, south London, Richmond, south-west London, and Brookwood, Surrey, will be able to receive deliveries that evening or pick up in store four hours after they have placed their orders. Robbie Feather, the Sainsbury\u2019s director of online, said the trial would be extended to a total of 30 stores if successful. \u201cAs our online sales grow, we are seeing an increasing proportion of orders placed for next-day delivery, so this trial is a natural next step in delivering our strategy to help customers shop whenever and wherever they want,\u201d he said. Sainsbury\u2019s online grocery sales reached \u00a31bn in 2013 and continue to grow faster than the wider food market. The company said online grocery sales rose by more than 8% in the three months to 4 June. But while Tesco has six dark stores, Sainsbury\u2019s is only just opening its first.",

Unions said that more than 700 staff were likely to be affected by the latest closures and most would probably be made redundant. Administrators are expected to redeploy some employees, but the closures suggest that hopes of finding a buyer are fading. Stores including Barnstaple, Chesterfield, Crewe, Derby, Falkirk, Poole, Torquay and Livingston will close on 30 July, a week after the first 20 stores close on Saturday. Dave Gill, national officer at sthe hopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, said: \u201cThis is terrible news for the staff in the 32 stores affected, on top of the 20 stores that are closing this Saturday. Our hope is that other retailers, including Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, will offer employment to these experienced, dedicated and loyal staff who suddenly find themselves unemployed. \u201cAt the same time, we are aware that the administrators are continuing to seek a buyer, who will hopefully be able to secure the future of the staff in the remaining stores.\u201d The shops are being closed as MPs prepare to publish a report on the demise of the retailer, which is likely to heavily criticise former owners Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell. Green last week set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS, claiming that he put \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. That amount almost exactly matches the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. It is part of more than \u00a3580m, including rental payments and interest, extracted from the company under his control. The collapse of BHS put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to a consortium led by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. The retailer failed 13 months later. Labour MP Frank Field chairs the work and pensions select committee, one of two parliamentary groups investigating BHS. He said Green\u2019s credibility rests on coming up with a generous settlement for pensioners, after a bad-tempered evidence session with the retail tycoon last month. Gill said: \u201cWe remain concerned that there is still no news from Sir Philip since he promised to sort the pension scheme, and we wait to hear details of what he proposes.

      "bodyText": "William Hill\u2019s chief executive, James Henderson, has been ousted by the company following its failure to capitalise on a growing online betting market. Henderson will leave immediately, ending a 31-year career at the bookmaker, which he joined as a trainee manager before working his way to the top. Shares rose 6% to 292p after the announcement on Thursday. Henderson was appointed chief executive two years ago, but the board called time on his leadership after progress with the online business stalled in 2015 and the introduction of a new mobile website and app did not go well. William Hill\u2019s chairman, Gareth Davis, said: \u201cSignificant challenges remain and in the recent past online has not performed against expectations. The board thinks it\u2019s the right time to bring in a new chief executive to take the company forward.\u201d Davis said there had been issues with the functionality of the website and user experience, and growth in the online business had been weak in the UK and non-existent internationally. The online business accounts for about 35% of William Hill\u2019s revenue. Davis thanked Henderson for his contribution to William Hill and said the network of almost 2,500 shops had performed \u201crobustly\u201d under his leadership, adding the board had not taken the decision lightly. \u201cIt was a very difficult decision made in sadness and with a heavy heart, not least because he\u2019s a smashing bloke, one of the nicest you could meet.\u201d William Hill issued a profit warning in March, less than a week after the end of the Cheltenham horse racing festival. At the time, Henderson said it was the worst Cheltenham of his career, as numerous favourites won championship races. Philip Bowcock \u2013 the bookmaker\u2019s chief financial officer who joined eight months ago \u2013 has been appointed interim chief executive until a replacement for Henderson is found. \u201cHe\u2019ll be putting the pedal to the floor,\u201d said Davis, \u201che has a full agenda.\u201d Henderson was on a 12-month notice period and will receive a year\u2019s salary, benefits and pension contributions, to be paid in monthly instalments. Any payments received by Henderson for working elsewhere during his notice period will be deducted from the monthly sum, the company said. In 2015, Henderson received a total package worth almost \u00a3915,000, including a basic salary of \u00a3550,000. William Hill said that while Bowcock was interim chief executive, he would receive the same package that Henderson was on before his departure. In a statement the bookmaker said the group\u2019s trading remained in line with the previous guidance of \u00a3260m-280m of operating profit in 2016. There was no comment from Henderson in the statement.",

The board thinks it\u2019s the right time to bring in a new chief executive to take the company forward.\u201d</p> <p>Davis said there had been issues with the functionality of the website and user experience, and growth in the online business had been weak in the UK and non-existent internationally. The online business accounts for about 35% of William Hill\u2019s revenue.</p> <p>Davis thanked Henderson for his contribution to William Hill and said the network of almost 2,500 shops had performed \u201crobustly\u201d under his leadership, adding the board had not taken the decision lightly.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very difficult decision made in sadness and with a heavy heart, not least because he\u2019s a smashing bloke, one of the nicest you could meet.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/william-hill-issues-profit-warning-after-cheltenham-and-online-losses\">William Hill issued a profit warning in March</a>, less than a week after the end of the Cheltenham horse racing festival. At the time, Henderson said it was the worst Cheltenham of his career, as numerous favourites won championship races.<br></p> <p>Philip Bowcock \u2013 the bookmaker\u2019s chief financial officer who joined eight months ago \u2013 has been appointed interim chief executive until a replacement for Henderson is found. \u201cHe\u2019ll be putting the pedal to the floor,\u201d said Davis, \u201che has a full agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Henderson was on a 12-month notice period and will receive a year\u2019s salary, benefits and pension contributions, to be paid in monthly instalments. Any payments received by Henderson for working elsewhere during his notice period will be deducted from the monthly sum, the company said.<br></p> <p>In 2015, Henderson received a total package worth almost \u00a3915,000, including a basic salary of \u00a3550,000.</p> <p>William Hill said that while Bowcock was interim chief executive, he would receive the same package that Henderson was on before his departure.</p> <p>In a statement the bookmaker said the group\u2019s trading remained in line with the previous guidance of \u00a3260m-280m of operating profit in 2016. There was no comment from Henderson in the statement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s budget deficit is on course to be much higher this year than the government hoped, despite an unexpectedly large fall in public borrowing last month, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said public borrowing in June stood at \u00a37.8bn, compared with \u00a310bn in the same month last year and the \u00a39.5bn predicted by the City. Although the smallest June deficit for nine years allowed the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to say the economy was in good shape to cope with the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the ONS figures show that deficit reduction in the first three months of the 2016-17 financial year was slower than forecast in George Osborne\u2019s March budget. Osborne envisaged borrowing being cut by around a quarter in the current year. But during the first three months of the financial year, slow growth in tax receipts meant there was an improvement of just over 8%. The ONS said public sector net borrowing \u2013 the government\u2019s preferred measure of the size of the budget deficit \u2013 stood at \u00a325.6bn in April to June 2016, compared to \u00a327.9bn in the same months in 2015. Assuming a similar performance for the year as a whole, the deficit would total almost \u00a370bn, rather than the \u00a355bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Analysts said the decision to leave the EU would lead to slower growth, with a knock-on effect on public finances. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u201cThere was some good news for the new chancellor in today\u2019s data, with public borrowing in June down by \u00a32.2bn on a year earlier, following two months when the deficit had been stuck at around the same levels as in the previous year. \u201cEconomic growth is likely to slow significantly after the Brexit vote, however, and this will take its toll on tax revenues. For 2016-17 as a whole, it therefore seems likely that the budget deficit will come in significantly higher than the OBR forecast back in March on the assumption of a vote to remain in the EU.\u201d Hammond said: \u201cThese public finance figures highlight the underlying strength of the British economy. Ahead of the referendum, monthly borrowing continued to fall, with the deficit in June the lowest it has been since 2007. \u201cAs our economy now adjusts to reflect the referendum decision, it is clear we will do so from a position of economic strength.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, shows that the median incomes of Australian households have stopped growing since the global financial crisis. The Hilda survey also highlights the continuing issue of housing affordability and that those under 35 have largely missed out on the increase in wealth households have experienced over the past 15 years. You only need to look to the state of affairs in America right now to know the importance of household incomes. In real terms, the median household disposable income in the US is now just 0.6% above what it was in 1989, and is about 6% below what it was just prior to the GFC hitting in 2007. Here in Australia we have not suffered such a collapse, but that is not to say the brakes have not been applied. According to the latest Hilda report, in 2009 the median household disposable income (in $2014) was $76,262 \u2013 a stunning 25% higher than it had been just five years earlier in 2004. But in 2014, five years after that peak year was reached, the median income is now $75,731 \u2013 a fall of 0.6%: Now before we get too panicked and start thinking we need our own version of Donald Trump (and not just in the Senate), a comparison with the US since 2001 shows that we are still doing relatively well: But when median household incomes flatline, it\u2019s never a good thing, and very much brings the issues of inequality into focus. The findings of the Hilda survey suggest inequality in 2014 did not increase greatly from the previous year. The income of households in the 90th percentile (that is those who have an income higher than 89% of all households) was 1.91 times that of median household income \u2013 a rise from 1.89 in 2013. That remains below the peak levels but it also means 2014 was the fourth year out of the past five where the incomes of the top 10% rose faster than those of median households. The Hilda report also suggests there may be a growing issue of entrenched income inequality. It uses a measure to calculate the stability in income from one year to the next. It found that since the start of this century that measure has been increasing \u2013 meaning that there is very little income mobility in Australia \u2013 and less than there was 15 years ago. As the report notes, \u201cthe increase in income stability from year to year is a positive development for people with good incomes, this is not a good development for people with low incomes, since they are more likely to have persistently low incomes\u201d: The Hilda data also allows us to discover what actually is the income of middle Australia. The $75,731 is for all households and does not reflect the various sizes each household may be. To compare a single person household with a family of four, the Hilda report, like the ABS and others, uses an \u201cequivalised\u201d figure. In 2014, the Hilda report estimates the median equivalised disposable incomes was $45,505. Thus a single person with this income was bang on middle income Australia. Given this is an after tax income, that would equate to someone earning around $54,700 . As extra people in the household means a greater amount of income is required to sustain the same standard of living, the equation used is to add 50% for each adult and 30% for each child. That means for a family of four of middle income in 2014 would have had a disposable income of $95,561. Given a standard 70/30 split of incomes this would mean the household would have earned around $117,700 a year before tax. So if you are a family of four with that income, your standard of living is essentially better than 50% of Australian and worse than 50%. The report also notes that home ownership is becoming less and less common. The rates of adults owning a home dropped from 64.4% in 2002 to 59.7% in 2014. When the survey used a more specific indicator of whether your were the legal owner of the home you were living in, the rate dropped from 57.0% in 2002 to just 51.7% in 2014. Part of this is due to the deadly combination of flattening income and increasing housing prices. And surprisingly it is not due to a massive increase in the headline grabbing million dollar plus houses \u2013 they have always been out of the reach of most first-home buyers. What the survey shows is the 10th percentile house prices (that is those which cost more than just 9% of houses sold) increased by 108% from 2001 to 2014 \u2013 well above the 76% increase in median house prices and the 47% increase in the price of houses in the top 10%: Most of the damage was done prior to the GFC. Since then housing affordability across the nation (if not in Sydney) has generally steadied. But that\u2019s ok if you were already in the housing market, not if you wanted to enter it. The ratio of the 10th percentile house prices to the 10th percentile equivalised disposable income went from 8.2 times in 2001 to 14.0 times in 2008. It has now fallen to 12.4 times. For those on median incomes looking to purchase a first-home (or at least a cheap one), the ratio has gone from 3.8 times median income to 6.2: While in the past five years affordability for those on low incomes \u2013 or those seeking a first-home \u2013 has improved, it remains much worse than it was at the start of the century. Given the link between home ownership and wealth, it is not surprising then that all the benefits of increased wealth have flowed to older Australians \u2013 those more likely to have been home owners before the boom in prices took off after 2001. The wealth of 25 to 34 year old householders in 2014 was just 3.2% more than their equivalents in 2002, whereas today\u2019s seniors on average have 61% more wealth than did over 65s back in 2002: It\u2019s a stark indicator of where the wealth of the country has flowed in the past 15 years. And why millennials will continue to feel aggrieved at the state of the housing market. It\u2019s not just about having a place to live \u2013 it also about building wealth. It\u2019s all very well to say they\u2019ll get their chance, but given wealth builds up over time, having to wait longer now, can mean less wealth later on in retirement.",

When the survey used a more specific indicator of whether your were the legal owner of the home you were living in, the rate dropped from 57.0% in 2002 to just 51.7% in 2014. </p> <p>Part of this is due to the deadly combination of flattening income and increasing housing prices. And surprisingly it is not due to a massive increase in the headline grabbing million dollar plus houses \u2013 they have always been out of the reach of most first-home buyers. </p> <p>What the survey shows is the 10th percentile house prices (that is those which cost more than just 9% of houses sold) increased by 108% from 2001 to 2014 \u2013 well above the 76% increase in median house prices and the 47% increase in the price of houses in the top 10%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Home values among home-owner households\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WmzMV/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Most of the damage was done prior to the GFC. Since then housing affordability across the nation (if not in Sydney) has generally steadied. But that\u2019s ok if you were already in the housing market, not if you wanted to enter it. </p> <p>The ratio of the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile house prices to the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile equivalised disposable income went from 8.2 times in 2001 to 14.0 times in 2008. It has now fallen to 12.4 times.</p> <p>For those on median incomes looking to purchase a first-home (or at least a cheap one), the ratio has gone from 3.8 times median income to 6.2:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of 10th percentile house prices to household equivalised disposable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sEa6F/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While in the past five years affordability for those on low incomes \u2013 or those seeking a first-home \u2013 has improved, it remains much worse than it was at the start of the century. </p> <p>Given the link between home ownership and wealth, it is not surprising then that all the benefits of increased wealth have flowed to older Australians \u2013 those more likely to have been home owners before the boom in prices took off after 2001.</p> <p>The wealth of 25 to 34 year old householders in 2014 was just 3.2% more than their equivalents in 2002, whereas today\u2019s seniors on average have 61% more wealth than did over 65s back in 2002:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median household wealth by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Av3BP/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a stark indicator of where the wealth of the country has flowed in the past 15 years. And why millennials will continue to feel aggrieved at the state of the housing market. It\u2019s not just about having a place to live \u2013 it also about building wealth. </p> <p>It\u2019s all very well to say they\u2019ll get their chance, but given wealth builds up over time, having to wait longer now, can mean less wealth later on in retirement. </p>",
