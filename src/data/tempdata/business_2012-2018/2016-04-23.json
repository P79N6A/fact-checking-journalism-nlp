      "bodyText": "The first ever British car was built in Coventry nearly 120 years ago. Now there are ambitious plans to re-establish the city as the heart of the country\u2019s recovering automotive industry. Carmakers, suppliers, universities, the local authority and the government have united in an attempt to turn Coventry into Britain\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d again, with hundreds of millions of pounds being invested. After the first British car was built by Daimler in 1897, Coventry\u2019s manufacturing industry grew until it reached a peak in the 1950s and 60s. At this stage, the UK was the second-biggest carmaker in the world and a host of the major companies were based in and or around Coventry, including the British Motor Corporation (maker of the Mini), Jaguar and Rootes Group, which later became part of Chrysler and then Peugeot. During this period, the average wage in Coventry was about 25% higher than the rest of the county. However, as the car industry fell into decline, so did Coventry, providing Britain with a similar story to the downfall of Detroit in the US, albeit on a smaller scale. In the late 1970s and early 1980s it is estimated that the top 15 employers in Coventry cut their combined workforce by almost half. Today, the only significant car production in Coventry is of London\u2019s black cabs, made by the Chinese-owned London Taxi Company. Jaguar closed its Browns Lane plant in 2005. However, Coventry has gradually emerged as a research and development (R&amp;D) hub, primarily thanks to the recovery of Jaguar Land Rover and Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a research partnership between the University of Warwick and leading manufacturers in the city. Next year, the city\u2019s R&amp;D sector will be boosted with the opening of the National Automotive Innovation Centre. The \u00a3150m project, backed by JLR, WMG and the government, will become a base for advanced research, with academics and engineers working together. In addition, JLR has laid out expansion plans for the area worth almost \u00a3500m, which it says will make Coventry the \u201chearts and brains\u201d of the company. It will significantly expand R&amp;D operations at its headquarters at nearby Whitley and build new offices at a site called \u201cGateway North\u201d. Crucially, however, it is also understood to be planning a major new car factory, meaning mass production could return to Coventry for the first time in more than a decade. The man overseeing the rebirth of Britain\u2019s motor city is Lord Bhattacharyya, who founded WMG in 1980 and is an adviser to Tata, helping to broker its takeover of JLR in 2008. \u201cJLR is now next door, there are suppliers coming here, and there may be one or two other car companies who might be here,\u201d he explains. \u201cI want it to be very similar to Stuttgart, or Munich, or Michigan. Coventry city council is very cooperative in doing that, which is a central factor. \u201cThe combination of Coventry city council and us and say JLR \u2013 we can produce a motor city here. There are various things that JLR is thinking of doing here that I can\u2019t talk about, but they are expanding hugely. Already they have created nearly 5,000 jobs in Coventry over the last five years.\u201d Bhattacharyya says such an industrial renaissance would require strong infrastructure, impressive R&amp;D facilities, and a wide collection of suppliers. \u201cYou don\u2019t put a motor city in the desert,\u201d he says. \u201cMotor city means you have facilities for the skill base, facilities for infrastructure, facilities for easy planning. There are all sorts of things you need.\u201d The optimism in Coventry is in stark contrast to the gloom surrounding the future of the steel industry and Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, a far more challenging investment for the Indian company. Analysts believe the plans for Coventry are credible. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has forecast car production in the UK will clear 2 million a year by 2020, the highest level on record. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, says: \u201cThere is an arc of research and development that goes from Horiba Mira [a research hub north of the city] into Coventry itself and then down to the motorsport industry and Silverstone. Probably about 90% of R&amp;D in the motor industry is in that space. It is a fantastic asset. \u201cWe don\u2019t do low-level assembly any more in the UK. We do design-intensive cars and we are going into low carbon. We are about to be able to make more cars than ever before, remarkably.\u201d However, Bailey says the UK needs to boost its car-parts sector in order to develop the automotive industry further. Just 40% of the parts on UK cars are from domestic sources, compared with 60% in Germany. \u201cWe need to do more on the supply chain,\u201d Bailey says. No matter how the plans for Coventry develop, WMG is already a world leader in its field. It was founded by Bhattacharyya, a Labour peer, in an attempt to breathe new life into British industry. Bhattacharyya was born in India but came to the UK to take up an apprenticeship with Lucas, which made parts for cars and planes, and was unimpressed by what he found. The concept of WMG was that the university would train graduates, with the companies paying for it and guiding the research. Today it has more than 600 staff, 4,000 students, and a research budget of \u00a3200m. It has tie-ups with more than 1,000 companies, although JLR and Tata are its leading partners and conduct their advanced research at the site. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, visited WMG last month to open its new energy innovation centre, which Bhattacharyya believes can make Britain a world leader in the development of battery technology. \u201cNew products are accelerating in this area, whether it is electric cars, solid batteries, liquid cells. The speed of development is huge, absolutely huge,\u201d Bhattacharyya says. Leading companies are being attracted by WMG\u2019s work in battery technology and driverless cars. A major global technology company is in talks to start working with WMG, but Bhattacharyya will not reveal its identity. \u201cWe want to be able to develop very quickly an electric car which is for the ordinary public,\u201d he says. \u201cAll this business you see in the newspapers with Google and driverless cars. It will come in 50, 40, 30 years\u2019 time, but you need the infrastructure for it. So when people talk about low-emission cars, it\u2019s not just the battery, it\u2019s a combination of things \u2013 how you control the car, how you drive the car, how you make the car lighter. It\u2019s the totality of it that will give you whatever you want.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shopping is the national pastime. High streets, malls and retail parks have long been places people went for a day out, rather than on a mission to buy a particular item, and their spending helped lift the country out of recession. But a big drop in footfall \u2013 the number of people visiting high street and retail centres \u2013 over the past year has exposed fresh cracks in the high street, leaving retail chiefs wondering where all their customers have gone. Analysts are reporting declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country of as much as 10% in some cities over the past year. Worries about the economic outlook, coupled with the rise of internet shopping, jitters about the EU referendum and more spending on eating out and leisure leave little cash left over for splurging in the shops. \u201cThere is a lot of nervousness around [among retailers],\u201d says Tim Denison, retail analyst at Ipsos Retail Performance. \u201cPeople have had more disposable income but retailers have not been as successful as they could have been in taking their share. Instead any spare money has gone on leisure and holidays rather than pure retail spend.\u201d According to Ipsos\u2019s retail traffic index, overall footfall was down 0.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago. But that headline masks the fact that some towns and cities are faring much worse than the national picture would suggest. The Ipsos data singles out Newcastle upon Tyne as the worst performer, with shopper numbers down a hefty 9.95% over the past year, closely followed by Stoke-on-Trent, down 8.1%. Other pockets of particular weakness were Chelmsford, Lincoln and Cambridge. By comparison Ashford in Kent, Crawley in West Sussex and Epsom in Surrey were among the best-performing retail centres \u2013 the result, according to Denison, of wealth radiating out from London. Even in those towns, however, growth is not exactly rampant. Five of the top seven best-performing shopping centres were up less than 1% year on year. A number of retail chains have already blamed poor performance on declining numbers of shoppers. Poundland has pointed directly to the fact there are fewer people on the high street as a key reason behind its slowing sales. Last week value fashion retailer Primark revealed its first drop in UK underlying sales for 12 years, although boss George Weston said it was not yet time to press the panic button, given that chilly spring weather had weighed on all sales for all fashion retailers. \u201cWe need some warm weather and then we will know if there is a real problem on the high street,\u201d he said. Marks &amp; Spencer and Next have also reported downbeat trading, with the boss of Next, Lord Wolfson, predicting the toughest trading conditions since the financial crisis after a gloomy reading of the 2016 economic runes. And at the end of last week the high street was braced for a fresh job losses and store closures after it emerged that the department store chain BHS was yet to secure a \u00a360m rescue loan it needs to stay in business, while menswear store Austin Reed was close to entering administration. BHS, which employs 10,000 people, was sold last year by Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 to a consortium of private investors who still insist they can revive its fortunes, but negotiations on the loan seem to have stalled. Last month BHS\u2019s landlords agreed to slash its rent bill but extra funding is required to pay staff and continue trading in its 164 stores. Austin Reed has been struggling for some time and last year shut 31 stores, leaving it with 155 shops and concessions. It has filed a notice of intent to appoint administrators, giving the retailer, which also owns Viyella and CC (previously Country Casuals), protection from creditors for 10 days before potentially tipping into administration. Denison said the depressed footfall numbers for Newcastle \u2013 which excludes the 340-store Metrocentre mall in nearby Gateshead \u2013 could be a result of the growing blight of empty high street shops in the north-east. According to consultancy the Local Data Company (LDC) the shop vacancy rate in Newcastle is 17.8%, compared with a national figure of 12.5%. \u201cThe north of England generally saw a drop in footfall of 1.2% in the first quarter, which was worse than the national average,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it is both a local and a regional issue.\u201d The plight of Newcastle United football club, which is firmly in the Premier League relegation zone, could also be a factor, suggests Denison. The Toon army finds itself with little to cheer \u2013 or shop \u2013 about. \u201cNewcastle also has a reputation for being a vibrant city, full of pubs and clubs,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople may be more inclined to spend any discretionary income on an evening out rather than in the shops.\u201d Some 46,000 UK shops lie empty and around a third of those have been empty for more than three years, says LDC director Matthew Hopkinson. After a torrid time during the recession, the national vacancy rate in March was at its the lowest since January 2010, at 12.5% \u2013 but that figure masks a serious mismatch between supply and demand. \u201cWhile stability has returned overall for the chain retailers in our high streets, the fact remains that they have continued to close more shops than they open and have done so since 2011,\u201d says Hopkinson. \u201cOut-of-town locations are a destination of choice for many of them, with free parking, easy access and more space to service and deliver the experiences that the modern consumer demands.\u201d Today retailers \u2013 and shoppers \u2013 want large, modern stores in the best locations, and these are boxes that older high streets are unable to tick. In Stoke-on-Trent for example, says Hopkinson, there are simply \u201ctoo many shops for the amount of people and the disposable income they\u2019ve got\u201d. Separate data, produced by industry trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC), also recorded a marked drop in footfall in March. Visits to high streets and malls were down nearly 4% compared with a year ago \u2013 although, in a sign of changing shopping tastes, visits to retail parks were up 1.6%. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson says the changes are the result of structural upheaval within the retail industry as shopping habits adapt in response to the internet. Figures from the Office for National Statistic showed online sales surging nearly 9% in March compared with a year ago, and online stores now accounting for 13.2% of all retail sales. \u201cWe know that declining footfall makes it harder to keep shops open and profitable,\u201d says Dickinson. \u201cAreas that are already economically fragile are likely to see the greatest impact of future store closures.\u201d Consumer spending has been the driving force behind Britain\u2019s economic recovery, making up for a sluggish manufacturing sector and recession-scarred construction industry. Last year household finances were buoyed by a recovery in wage growth and near-zero inflation. At the same time, employment was rising and the upward march of house prices left homeowners feeling flush. But economists believe the UK economy has lost momentum since the start of this year and will remain subdued over coming months. The first official snapshot of GDP growth for the opening quarter of 2016 is released this week. A Reuters poll found economists expect growth in for the period from January to March to have dropped to 0.4% from the robust 0.6% recorded in the final three months of 2015. The new year started with turbulence on global markets, with wild swings in share prices. Stocks have recovered, but jitters remain in the real economy, particularly over China\u2019s slowdown and the prospect of interest rates rising in the world\u2019s other leading economy, the US. Companies are complaining about tougher export markets and an uncertain domestic outlook thanks to government cuts and the upcoming EU referendum. Morale has not been helped by job cuts at high-profile companies including Tata Steel, Lloyds Banking Group, British Gas, Asda and Npower. Official figures last week showed the first rise in unemployment since last summer and a slowdown in wage growth, which will be felt more keenly by workers given that inflation is on the rise again. On the high street those jitters translated into falling sales last month. An early Easter could not offset the chill of global gloom and unsettled weather, and a drop in clothing and food sales hit retail volumes \u2013 the number of items sold \u2013 down by 1.3% in March. The question now puzzling economists is whether the slowdown in spending and in wider GDP growth is a temporary Brexit-related pause or a more permanent downward shift. \u201cI think this reflects the financial pressures on consumers,\u201d says Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cInflation is picking up, the labour market is not looking quite as healthy. Jobs growth clearly has slowed ... and the fiscal squeeze is starting to be felt, with welfare cuts in April. I wouldn\u2019t pin the consumer slowdown on Brexit.\u201d Tombs sees two key problems for retailers. First, a weak pound is raising the price of UK imports. Second, retailers are having to adjust to higher labour costs after the national living wage was implemented this month. \u201cRetailers are going to find it difficult to pass on those costs to consumers and we could see more pressure on margins.\u201d WHAT MARY DID FOR ASHFORD Ashford, Kent, one of the so-called Portas Pilots, which received government support in 2012 to rejuvenate its shopping centre, is one of the towns that has bucked the gloomy trend. The scheme was the brainchild of Mary \u201cQueen of Shops\u201d Portas, who was asked by the coalition to come up with ideas for breathing new life into British high streets. Her report resulted in 27 towns around the country being offered government payouts to help them improve facilities and attract new shoppers. Visitors to the town are up 1.6% year-on-year thanks to a raft of retail initiatives, including a decision by the council to buy and revamp the struggling Park Mall, turning it into a shopping destination by inviting local artisans to sell their wares in pop-up stores. The turnaround is being held up as an example of what can be achieved if stakeholders work together to improve a retail centre\u2019s fortunes.",

      "body": "<p>Shopping is the national pastime. High streets, malls and retail parks have long been places people went for a day out, rather than on a mission to buy a particular item, and their spending helped lift the country out of recession. But a big drop in footfall \u2013 the number of people visiting high street and retail centres \u2013 over the past year has exposed fresh cracks in the high street, leaving retail chiefs wondering where all their customers have gone.</p> <p>Analysts are reporting declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country of as much as 10% in some cities over the past year. Worries about the economic outlook, coupled with the rise of internet shopping, jitters about the EU referendum and more spending on eating out and leisure leave little cash left over for splurging in the shops.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of nervousness around [among retailers],\u201d says Tim Denison, retail analyst at Ipsos Retail Performance. \u201cPeople have had more disposable income but retailers have not been as successful as they could have been in taking their share. Instead any spare money has gone on leisure and holidays rather than pure retail spend.\u201d</p> <p>According to Ipsos\u2019s retail traffic index, overall footfall was down 0.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago. But that headline masks the fact that some towns and cities are faring much worse than the national picture would suggest.</p> <p>The Ipsos data singles out Newcastle upon Tyne as the worst performer, with shopper numbers down a hefty 9.95% over the past year, closely followed by Stoke-on-Trent, down 8.1%. Other pockets of particular weakness were Chelmsford, Lincoln and Cambridge.</p> <p>By comparison Ashford in Kent, Crawley in West Sussex and Epsom in Surrey were among the best-performing retail centres \u2013 the result, according to Denison, of wealth radiating out from London. Even in those towns, however, growth is not exactly rampant. Five of the top seven best-performing shopping centres were up less than 1% year on year.</p> <p>A number of retail chains have already blamed poor performance on declining numbers of shoppers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/poundland-admits-buying-rival-99p-stores-hit-sales\" title=\"\">Poundland has pointed directly to the fact there are fewer people on the high street </a>as a key reason behind its slowing sales.</p> <p>Last week value fashion retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/19/primark-first-fall-half-year-sales-12-years\" title=\"\">Primark revealed its first drop in UK underlying sales</a> for 12 years, although boss George Weston said it was not yet time to press the panic button, given that chilly spring weather had weighed on all sales for all fashion retailers. \u201cWe need some warm weather and then we will know if there is a real problem on the high street,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer and Next have also reported downbeat trading, with the boss of Next, Lord Wolfson, predicting the toughest trading conditions since the financial crisis after a gloomy reading of the 2016 economic runes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbdcf2e4ef9b7ec9f8b40d95adb272f7c961888b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbdcf2e4ef9b7ec9f8b40d95adb272f7c961888b/0_140_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\".BHS, Oxford Street, London.

The department store is trying to negotiate a \u00a360m rescue loan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And at the end of last week the high street was braced for a fresh job losses and store closures after it emerged that the department store chain BHS was yet to secure a \u00a360m rescue loan it needs to stay in business, while menswear store Austin Reed was close to entering administration.</p> <p>BHS, which employs 10,000 people, was sold last year by Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 to a consortium of private investors who still insist they can revive its fortunes, but negotiations on the loan seem to have stalled. Last month BHS\u2019s landlords agreed to slash its rent bill but extra funding is required to pay staff and continue trading in its 164 stores.</p> <p>Austin Reed has been struggling for some time and last year shut 31 stores, leaving it with 155 shops and concessions. It has filed a notice of intent to appoint administrators, giving the retailer, which also owns Viyella and CC (previously Country Casuals), protection from creditors for 10 days before potentially tipping into administration.</p> <p>Denison said the depressed footfall numbers for Newcastle \u2013 which excludes the 340-store Metrocentre mall in nearby Gateshead \u2013 could be a result of the growing blight of empty high street shops in the north-east. According to consultancy the Local Data Company (LDC) the shop vacancy rate in Newcastle is 17.8%, compared with a national figure of 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cThe north of England generally saw a drop in footfall of 1.2% in the first quarter, which was worse than the national average,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it is both a local and a regional issue.\u201d The plight of Newcastle United football club, which is firmly in the Premier League relegation zone, could also be a factor, suggests Denison. The Toon army finds itself with little to cheer \u2013 or shop \u2013 about.</p> <p>\u201cNewcastle also has a reputation for being a vibrant city, full of pubs and clubs,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople may be more inclined to spend any discretionary income on an evening out rather than in the shops.\u201d</p> <p>Some 46,000 UK shops lie empty and around a third of those have been empty for more than three years, says LDC director Matthew Hopkinson. After a torrid time during the recession, the national vacancy rate in March was at its the lowest since January 2010, at 12.5% \u2013 but that figure masks a serious mismatch between supply and demand.</p> <p>\u201cWhile stability has returned overall for the chain retailers in our high streets, the fact remains that they have continued to close more shops than they open and have done so since 2011,\u201d says Hopkinson. \u201cOut-of-town locations are a destination of choice for many of them, with free parking, easy access and more space to service and deliver the experiences that the modern consumer demands.\u201d</p> <p>Today retailers \u2013 and shoppers \u2013 want large, modern stores in the best locations, and these are boxes that older high streets are unable to tick. In Stoke-on-Trent for example, says Hopkinson, there are simply \u201ctoo many shops for the amount of people and the disposable income they\u2019ve got\u201d.</p> <p>Separate data, produced by industry trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC), also recorded a marked drop in footfall in March. Visits to high streets and malls were down nearly 4% compared with a year ago \u2013 although, in a sign of changing shopping tastes, visits to retail parks were up 1.6%.</p> <p>BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson says the changes are the result of structural upheaval within the retail industry as shopping habits adapt in response to the internet.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistic showed online sales surging nearly 9% in March compared with a year ago, and online stores now accounting for 13.2% of all retail sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3038b1f0fbc71c2ca92c7af3514bcd1232594a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3038b1f0fbc71c2ca92c7af3514bcd1232594a6/0_257_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A busy day in Cambridge, but even the prosperous university town has seen a fall in shopper numbers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A busy day in Cambridge, but even the prosperous university town has seen a fall in shopper numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe know that declining footfall makes it harder to keep shops open and profitable,\u201d says Dickinson. \u201cAreas that are already economically fragile are likely to see the greatest impact of future store closures.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer spending has been the driving force behind Britain\u2019s economic recovery, making up for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/08/weak-industry-data-set-to-weigh-on-uk-economy-steel-production\" title=\"\">sluggish manufacturing sector</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/uk-housebuilding-booms-but-construction-sector-flags\" title=\"\">recession-scarred construction industry</a>. Last year household finances were buoyed by a recovery in wage growth and near-zero inflation. At the same time, employment was rising and the upward march of house prices left homeowners feeling flush.</p> <p>But economists believe the UK economy has lost momentum since the start of this year and will remain subdued over coming months. The first official snapshot of GDP growth for the opening quarter of 2016 is released this week. A Reuters poll found economists expect growth in for the period from January to March to have dropped to 0.4% from the robust 0.6% recorded in the final three months of 2015.</p> <p>The new year started with turbulence on global markets, with wild swings in share prices. Stocks have recovered, but jitters remain in the real economy, particularly over China\u2019s slowdown and the prospect of interest rates rising in the world\u2019s other leading economy, the US.</p> <p>Companies are complaining about tougher export markets and an uncertain domestic outlook thanks to government cuts and the upcoming EU referendum. Morale has not been helped by job cuts at high-profile companies including Tata Steel, Lloyds Banking Group, British Gas, Asda and Npower.</p> <p>Official figures last week showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/uk-unemployment-rises-and-pay-growth-falls\" title=\"\">the first rise in unemployment since last summer</a> and a slowdown in wage growth, which will be felt more keenly by workers given that inflation is on the rise again.</p> <p>On the high street those jitters translated into falling sales last month. An early Easter could not offset the chill of global gloom and unsettled weather, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/uk-retail-sales-drop-shoppers-cut-back-food-clothes-ons\" title=\"\">a drop in clothing and food sales hit retail volumes \u2013 the number of items sold \u2013 down by 1.3% in March</a>.</p> <p>The question now puzzling economists is whether the slowdown in spending and in wider GDP growth is a temporary Brexit-related pause or a more permanent downward shift.</p> <p>\u201cI think this reflects the financial pressures on consumers,\u201d says Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cInflation is picking up, the labour market is not looking quite as healthy. Jobs growth clearly has slowed ... and the fiscal squeeze is starting to be felt, with welfare cuts in April. I wouldn\u2019t pin the consumer slowdown on Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Tombs sees two key problems for retailers. First, a weak pound is raising the price of UK imports. Second, retailers are having to adjust to higher labour costs after the national living wage was implemented this month. \u201cRetailers are going to find it difficult to pass on those costs to consumers and we could see more pressure on margins.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e26ab5dc18f56bb8fd525aebea33041c16f8b7ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e26ab5dc18f56bb8fd525aebea33041c16f8b7ef/0_72_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Portas, seen here with David Cameron, has tried to revive shopping in provincial centres around the country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Portas, seen here with David Cameron, has tried to revive shopping in provincial centres around the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>WHAT MARY DID FOR ASHFORD</h2> <p>Ashford, Kent, one of the so-called Portas Pilots, which received government support in 2012 to rejuvenate its shopping centre, is one of the towns that has bucked the gloomy trend.</p> <p>The scheme was the brainchild of Mary \u201cQueen of Shops\u201d Portas, who was asked by the coalition to come up with ideas for breathing new life into British high streets. Her report resulted in 27 towns around the country being offered government payouts to help them improve facilities and attract new shoppers.</p> <p>Visitors to the town are up 1.6% year-on-year thanks to a raft of retail initiatives, including a decision by the council to buy and revamp the struggling Park Mall, turning it into a shopping destination by inviting local artisans to sell their wares in pop-up stores. The turnaround is being held up as an example of what can be achieved if stakeholders work together to improve a retail centre\u2019s fortunes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just after 8am, in the bowels of Manhattan\u2019s concrete rabbit warren Penn Station, there are a lot of queues. Long lines of travellers wait for the Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak trains; for the bathrooms where dozens of homeless people spend the night; and for food and drinks outside Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Starbucks and Pret a Manger. The line for the French-sounding-but-British-owned Pret is longer than that for any of the other food chains. That\u2019s no surprise as the outlet, above platforms 20 and 21 on the LIRR, is the busiest for its size of all the 400 or so Prets worldwide. The chain \u2013 founded with one outlet in London\u2019s Victoria by serial food entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe and his friend Sinclair Beecham 30 years ago \u2013 now operates around the world including China and France. And it is growing fast: last week Pret revealed sales climbed nearly 14% last year, to \u00a3676m. The improvement is not just the result of opening more outlets: takings at branches open more than a year were up 7.5%. Profits rose 14.5% to more than \u00a384m. Pret\u2019s customers are trendy, health-conscious types. The company says sales of vegetarian options are up \u201cin double digits\u201d and it is trialling a veggie-only pop-up shop in the summer. Takings from lines containing avocado were up 26% last year: Pret\u2019s outlets got through 5 million avocados in 12 months. The first steps into the US \u2013 back in 2001, with a store on New York\u2019s Broad Street \u2013 were faltering. Americans thought the sandwiches had too much mayonnaise and they took time to be convinced that food sold in packages, rather than made to order in a deli, could be truly fresh. But the US is now Pret\u2019s most significant market outside the UK \u2013 with 65 stores and 10 more planned this year. One of those will be a second outlet in busy Penn Station. Clive Schlee, chief executive, says: \u201cWe have become a bit of a beacon there.\u201d He says Pret\u2019s strategy in the US has been the same as in the UK: constant, steady innovation to get the mix right before expansion. It took five years of tinkering in the UK before Pret opened its second store. Other businesses that have expanded abroad and have been forced into \u201chideous retreats\u201d have made the mistake of trying to copy the same large-scale operations they have in the UK. \u201cAt Pret, we can just do a small-scale kitchen within our own shop. It takes longer but it\u2019s more durable,\u201d says Schlee, who joined Pret during its uncertain overseas expansion phase in the early 2000s. At that time McDonald\u2019s was a 33% shareholder, although it later sold its stake. In the US, Pret has now adapted to sell a more seasonal menu, including iced teas and coffees suitable for hot summers and a broader range of hot foods for cold days. Customers can also choose from six salad dressing options \u2013 compared with the one included in the box in the UK. Meanwhile, filter coffee \u2013 which punters serve themselves \u2013 makes up more than 80% of coffee sales, whereas in Europe more than 80% prefer espresso-based drinks. Schlee says: \u201cIt took time to teach [Americans] that our food was fresher than they could make themselves from the deli, where the ingredients might have been sitting around.\u201d Now he believes New York is a \u201cwonderful Pret market\u201d and the company could easily have as many stores there as it has in London. Pret is now majority owned by private equity firm Bridgepoint, with Metcalfe and the management holding small stakes. Bridgepoint, whose other investments include businesses like Fat Face, Hobbycraft and Leeds Bradford Airport, has been involved for eight years, but so far shows no sign of checking out and there are no current plans to float the business. \u201cSomeone once asked Julian Metcalfe what adjective he would use to describe Pret and he said dependable. At the time people thought that was not very glamorous but actually that\u2019s what you want \u2013 dependable friends, dependable meals,\u201d says Schlee. It\u2019s also about reassuring ethical policies, he says, such as donating waste food to the homeless through direct relationships with hostels and offering jobs to more than 200 homeless people. But Schlee argues that Pret\u2019s key strategy of making food fresh in kitchens behind each coffee shop \u2013 even those in busy and expensive locations such as Waterloo station \u2013 is the key strength of the business. Supermarkets and the vast majority of other sandwich chains make their food in factories and deliver them to stores. Pret\u2019s system offers better flexibility to adapt to new food trends \u2013 such as veggie food and avocados \u2013 and sudden fluctuations in demand caused by the weather or disruption at transport hubs that can mean surges or slumps in customer numbers. The chain introduces new food options every three or four months and is currently testing out evening meals in London. As the government prepares its sugar tax, Pret is looking at lowering the natural sugar content of its fruit juices and has 15 staff looking at the next food trends. In the UK, Schlee is counting on the freshness and flexibility of Pret\u2019s food to fend off rising competition on the high street. \u201cWhen you invite your mother-in-law for lunch on Saturday, you don\u2019t give her food you\u2019ve made two or three days before \u2013 you make something that morning. And that\u2019s what gives us a massive competitive edge,\u201d he says. That edge will be important, as up to a fifth of stores selling clothing, books and other physical products are moving out of the high street. The gaps are being filled by an ever-increasing array of eateries ramping up competition with the likes of Pret. Schlee says: \u201cPret tends not to worry about the competition but about being true to itself, avoiding the temptation of centrally made food and making sure we look after our staff.\u201d The focus on healthy fare has helped Pret open its first outlet in a British hospital \u2013 a new area for expansion \u2013 and there are plans to move onto university campuses as well as open more outlets in regional British cities such as Manchester. Friendly staff \u2013 with the freedom to hand out free coffees to whoever they like up to a certain percentage of sales \u2013 are a big part of building loyalty in those new stores. Pret doesn\u2019t use zero-hours contracts and has raised wages to maintain the business\u2019s differential above the new minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 the so-called \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced by the government this month. Staff earn \u00a37.50 an hour and can earn a \u00a31-an-hour bonus if they meet customer service criteria checked by mystery shoppers every week. Workers who put in a full day\u2019s shift also get two free meals and paid breaks. Schlee says the package will help Pret remain the \u201cemployer of choice\u201d among coffee chains, helping it stand out from rivals such as Caff\u00e8 Nero and Eat, both of which have recently been criticised for cutting back on staff benefits. There are also bonuses, staff discounts, Friday night parties and paid breaks, which are an important part of its culture. \u201cThat\u2019s a very meaningful part of what we pay,\u201d Schlee says. The deal for workers, he says, means Pret has lower staff turnover than the majority of its rivals \u2013 less than half its staff leave every year. Certainly he is a stayer, having spent 13 years running Pret. Why is he still here? \u201cMy wife says anyone can run Pret. The management is extremely lucky to be selling healthy food at convenience and speed, which is what people want. We have had favourable winds,\u201d he says.",

It takes longer but it\u2019s more durable,\u201d says Schlee, who joined Pret during its uncertain overseas expansion phase in the early 2000s. At that time McDonald\u2019s was a 33% shareholder, although it later sold its stake.</p> <p>In the US, Pret has now adapted to sell a more seasonal menu, including iced teas and coffees suitable for hot summers and a broader range of hot foods for cold days. Customers can also choose from six salad dressing options \u2013 compared with the one included in the box in the UK. Meanwhile, filter coffee \u2013 which punters serve themselves \u2013 makes up more than 80% of coffee sales, whereas in Europe more than 80% prefer espresso-based drinks.</p> <p>Schlee says: \u201cIt took time to teach [Americans] that our food was fresher than they could make themselves from the deli, where the ingredients might have been sitting around.\u201d</p> <p>Now he believes New York is a \u201cwonderful Pret market\u201d and the company could easily have as many stores there as it has in London.</p> <p>Pret is now majority owned by private equity firm Bridgepoint, with Metcalfe and the management holding small stakes. Bridgepoint, whose other investments include businesses like Fat Face, Hobbycraft and Leeds Bradford Airport, has been involved for eight years, but so far shows no sign of checking out and there are no current plans to float the business.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone once asked Julian Metcalfe what adjective he would use to describe Pret and he said dependable. At the time people thought that was not very glamorous but actually that\u2019s what you want \u2013 dependable friends, dependable meals,\u201d says Schlee.</p> <p>It\u2019s also about reassuring ethical policies, he says, such as donating waste food to the homeless through direct relationships with hostels and offering jobs to more than 200 homeless people.</p> <p>But Schlee argues that Pret\u2019s key strategy of making food fresh in kitchens behind each coffee shop \u2013 even those in busy and expensive locations such as Waterloo station \u2013 is the key strength of the business. Supermarkets and the vast majority of other sandwich chains make their food in factories and deliver them to stores.</p> <p>Pret\u2019s system offers better flexibility to adapt to new food trends \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/19/pret-a-manger-sales-rise-as-vegetarian-range-pleases-foodies\" title=\"\">such as veggie food and avocados</a> \u2013 and sudden fluctuations in demand caused by the weather or disruption at transport hubs that can mean surges or slumps in customer numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670925898d7305566220a724e51b0b4f74b7a913\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/670925898d7305566220a724e51b0b4f74b7a913/0_294_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pret a Manger at Penn Station: customers can serve themselves filter coffee, and have a choice of salad dressings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pret a Manger at Penn Station: customers can serve themselves filter coffee, and have a choice of salad dressings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chain introduces new food options every three or four months and is currently testing out evening meals in London. As the government prepares its sugar tax, Pret is looking at lowering the natural sugar content of its fruit juices and has 15 staff looking at the next food trends.</p> <p>In the UK, Schlee is counting on the freshness and flexibility of Pret\u2019s food to fend off rising competition on the high street. \u201cWhen you invite your mother-in-law for lunch on Saturday, you don\u2019t give her food you\u2019ve made two or three days before \u2013 you make something that morning. And that\u2019s what gives us a massive competitive edge,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That edge will be important, as up to a fifth of stores selling clothing, books and other physical products are moving out of the high street. The gaps are being filled by an ever-increasing array of eateries ramping up competition with the likes of Pret.</p> <p>Schlee says: \u201cPret tends not to worry about the competition but about being true to itself, avoiding the temptation of centrally made food and making sure we look after our staff.\u201d</p> <p>The focus on healthy fare has helped Pret open its first outlet in a British hospital \u2013 a new area for expansion \u2013 and there are plans to move onto university campuses as well as open more outlets in regional British cities such as Manchester.</p> <p>Friendly staff \u2013 with the freedom to hand out free coffees to whoever they like up to a certain percentage of sales \u2013 are a big part of building loyalty in those new stores.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The management is extremely lucky to be selling healthy food at convenience and speed, which is what people want.</p> <footer> <cite>Clive Schlee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pret doesn\u2019t use zero-hours contracts and has raised wages to maintain the business\u2019s differential above the new minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 the so-called \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced by the government this month.</p> <p>Staff earn \u00a37.50 an hour and can earn a \u00a31-an-hour bonus if they meet customer service criteria checked by mystery shoppers every week.

      "bodyText": "From New York to London, the air seems to be getting a little thinner at the dizzy heights of the property market. The collapse of a 78-story \u201cshadow-maker\u201d condo development in an exclusive enclave of the Upper East Side of Manhattan is sending shockwaves through the city\u2019s real estate market. And in London the decision to hold back the sale of apartments in the landmark Battersea power station development has also rattled already nervous buyers, sellers and developers. Years of high-priced deals fueled by an international jetset with seemingly limitless supplies of cash appear to be coming to an end amid a crackdown on murky foreign ownership and property investments that could freeze an already cooling market. The planned, Norman Foster-designed 900ft (275-meter) tower on Sutton Place, Manhattan, landed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy court earlier this month after its developers failed to refinance short-term loans on the project. A blizzard of recriminations have followed, with the project\u2019s Bauhouse Group chief Joseph Beninati developer accusing lender Richard Kalikow of pulling out of the project in order to seize control. Behind them are larger shadows, warnings that the project\u2019s failure signals global economic turbulence and the impact increased scrutiny is having on international buyers, the mainstay of high-end buyers in New York, Miami and Los Angeles and around the world. In London, the Battersea Power Station Development company held back some of its Frank Gehry- and Foster + Partners-designed apartments after its CEO confessed the market had become \u201cquite challenging\u201d. Warnings that the luxury market is off its highs are multiplying. A recent survey found there are more than 300 new ultra high-end apartments under development in the vicinity of Sutton Place alone. Yet the number of Manhattan properties selling for $4m or more fell to its lowest level in four years in the first three months of the year. Real estate agents say Bauhouse\u2019s comparative lack of experience and local opposition contributed to the project\u2019s defeat. \u201cThe failure of that project is to do with the zoning choices they made,\u201d says New York real estate agent Paula del Nunzio. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fluctuation for sure. But when all those contracts close \u2013 if the buyers chose to go through them, the market will have an uptick.\u201d Dirty money crackdown But the larger question of whether well-publicized crackdowns on \u201cdirty money\u201d ownership through shell companies announced last year by the Department of the Treasury, or calls for more information about offshore accounts after the Panama Papers, could exacerbate the situation. In recent years mysterious, anonymous home buyers have snapped up real estate in all of the world\u2019s top property markets in growing numbers. And the US authorities are worried that high-priced apartments are being used to launder illicit gains. \u201cWe are seeking to understand the risk that corrupt foreign officials, or transnational criminals, may be using premium US real estate to secretly invest millions in dirty money,\u201d said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), last year. Under the new rules title insurance companies will be required to identify the \u201cnatural persons\u201d behind shell companies used to pay cash for properties worth more than $3m (\u00a32m) in Manhattan and $1m in Miami-Dade County, the second largest area for foreign property investment. Earlier this month, the Miami Herald uncovered a series of property deals, routed through offshore shell companies set up by Mossack Fonseca, the firm at the center of the Panama Papers controversy, that could be traced to foreign nationals accused of corruption. Of the 19 foreign nationals creating offshore companies and buying Miami real estate, eight have been linked to corruption or fraud in their home countries. The Herald reported that many people coming to Olga Santini, a Miami representative for the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca were \u201cBrazilian politicians, judges and politically connected businessmen\u201d. Miami\u2019s financial institutions report more suspicious activity than any other major US city besides New York City and Los Angeles, according to Treasury Department\u2019s FinCen data. South Florida, the Herald concluded, \u201cis a hub of the world\u2019s shadow economy\u201d where lack of controls on real-estate deals as made \u201cMiami a magnet for questionable currency\u201d. The paper also reported how The Miami Association of Realtors hosted an event called \u201cHow to avoid the Treasury trap\u201d, a reference to new federal anti-money laundering rules. The \u2018crack cocaine of real estate\u2019 Projects in Miami and New York have also benefitted from the EB-5 visa program \u2013 the \u201ccrack cocaine of real estate\u201d, according to one Manhattan broker \u2013 that puts foreign nationals on a path to US citizenship if they invest between $500,000 to $1m in a US project. There are more than 17,000 pending EB-5 immigration applications. The lengthy application process has created a ready business for banks, including Citibank and Signature Bank, offering developers\u2019 bridging loans. According to marketing documents obtained by the business blog the Real Deal, one of the largest EB-5 brokers in the US, NES Financial, based in San Jose, estimates that $2bn to $3bn in EB-5 capital is raised in the US annually. Over the past five years, the company\u2019s EB-5 business grew 71%. Most of its 450 projects are in New York and California. EB-5 funded projects include a Trump skyscraper in Jersey City, New Jersey, developed by the presidential candidates son-in-law Jared Kushner. The project, reports Bloomberg, is being partially funded by 100 Chinese investors through US Immigration Funds, company that solicits foreign investors interested in investment visas. But the investor green card program, popular with Chinese investors, could become harder to enroll in if plans to increase the amount required to as much as $1.2m to be approved. In recent testimony, Nicholas Colucci, chief of the Immigrant Investor Program Office for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, said $8.7bn had been invested in the US economy through the EB-5 program since March 2012 and created an estimated 35,140 jobs. Real estate agents say the original purpose to invest in underfunded areas \u2013 including a failed $60m meat-packing plant in South Dakota \u2013 have been ignored. Instead, EB-5 investment has been traced to real estate on Central Park South or the Design District in Miami where large swathes were developed in partnership with the French luxury giant LVMH. Last year, Fortune magazine\u2019s Peter Elkind noted that because the EB-5 industry is virtually unregulated, it has become \u201ca magnet for amateurs, pipe-dreamers, and charlatans, who see it as an easy way to score funding for ventures that banks would never touch\u201d. Because wealthy foreigners are the main potential victims, he continued, \u201cUS authorities have seemed inattentive to abuses\u201d. EB-5 projects periodically end up in court. In 2013, the SEC charged Chicago EB-5 promoter Anshoo Sethi for allegedly swindling 250 Chinese investors for more than $145m supposed to go toward a hotel and conference center. In another case, a New York based lawyer, Hui Feng, who was accused of pocketing $1.2m in commissions. The net result of EB-5 investment, warns one real estate agent, has been to boost real estate values to the point that it is only affordable to institutional investors and pension funds. \u201cThey\u2019re the only people buying and this is going to blow up our economy again.\u201d For this and other reasons, failure of the Sutton Place shadow-maker may be a harbinger of things to come.",

    "webTitle": "Revealed: nearly all new diesel cars exceed official pollution limits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ninety-seven percent of all modern diesel cars emit more toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution on the road than the official limit, according to the most comprehensive set of data yet published, with a quarter producing at least six times more than the limit. Surprisingly, the tiny number of models that did not exceed the standard were mostly Volkswagens, the carmaker whose cheating of diesel emissions tests which emerged last year sparked the scandal. Experts said the new results show that clean diesel cars can be made but that virtually all manufacturers have failed to do so. The new data, from testing industry leader Emissions Analytics (EA), follows the publication this week by the Department for Transport of emissions results for 37 vehicles, all of which emitted more NOx on the road than the official limit. But the new data covers more than 250 vehicles in more stringently standardised road conditions. EA found that just one of 201 Euro 5 diesels, the EU standard from 2009, did not exceed the limit, while only seven of 62 Euro 6 diesels, the stricter standard since 2014, did so. Diesel cars must meet an official EU limit for NOx but are only tested in a laboratory under fixed conditions. All vehicles sold pass this regulation but, when taken out on to real roads, almost all emit far more pollution. There is no suggestion that any of the cars tested broke the law on emissions limits or used any cheat devices. Mayoral candidates in London, the city with the worst air quality in Britain, have seized on the DfT data to call for tighter controls on polluting traffic \u2013 including a ban on diesel cars. An ultra-low emission zone in central London from 2020 will levy charges on all but the cleanest vehicles. The Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, said he would be immediately consulting on a more stringent zone which could be extended to outer boroughs. \u201cLondoners are seeing their lives cut short because of the misleading emissions produced by some of the world\u2019s biggest and most respected car brands.\u201d Goldsmith added that as mayor he would issue public smog alerts to give accurate information on air quality. Caroline Pidgeon, the Lib Dem mayoral candidate, said: \u201cThe figures are exactly the reason why we need to speed up the introduction of the ultra-low emission zone so that it starts in 2018. Ultimately we will need to ban diesel vehicles from much of London and we need a mayor prepared to take these tough decisions and work with people to make these changes happen.\u201d NOx is at illegally high levels in many British cities and the government estimates this pollution is responsible for 23,500 premature deaths a year. The government lost a supreme court challenge in 2015 over the adequacy of its plans to tackle the crisis and is facing a fresh challenge over its new strategy. \u201cThere is a growing worry about air pollution, but while some car manufacturers have been more proactive, others have done only the minimum,\u201d said Nick Molden, the CEO of EA. \u201cThe point is diesels can be clean.\u201d EA claims to have tested the emissions of more cars driving on real roads than any other group in the world and has now published the NOx results for 263 models. The good performance of the VW models, which did not have cheat devices fitted, was surprising, Molden said: \u201cIt is hugely ironic.\u201d The EA analysis found that just one of the 201 Euro 5 diesels tested \u2013 a Skoda Octavia \u2013 did not exceed the official limit on the road. Over a quarter of the Euro 5s pumped out at least five times the official limit, including models from BMW, Range Rover, Mercedes, Nissan, Renault and Vauxhall. Of the 62 Euro 6 models tested by EA, seven did not exceed the official limit in real-world driving: four Volkswagens, a BMW, an Audi and a Skoda. However, an Audi A8 and a Fiat 500X were found to emit more than 12 times the official limit, while a BMW X3, a Volvo S60 and a Vauxhall Zafira were among models emitting more than six times the official limit on the road. The EA tests were all performed on the same route in south-west London, with the same drivers, at the same time of day and with the same load weight in the vehicles. Tests were only performed when the weather \u2013 temperature, rain and wind \u2013 was within certain parameters. One leading respiratory expert said the emissions discrepancies shown in the DfT report released on Thursday amounted to \u201can unacceptable scandal\u201d. Sir Malcolm Green, a professor of respiratory medicine who founded the British Lung Foundation, said the revelations showed \u201cappalling behaviour\u201d by many major car firms. \u201cThis is a massive failure of public trust by these companies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is well established that current levels of pollution are shortening people\u2019s lives, on a population basis,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis is a massive and deliberate deceit. It\u2019s appalling behaviour by the car manufacturers involved. \u201cThey were selling these cars on the basis that they were clean diesels. I find it shocking. The more we look into it, the more it looks like a widespread thing across many manufacturers. It\u2019s outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Asthma UK said two-thirds of asthmatics reported their condition being exacerbated by high levels of emissions. \u201cPeople with asthma need accurate information about asthma triggers, including air pollution, to help them manage their condition,\u201d said Dan Murphy, the head of external affairs for Asthma UK. \u201cSo if they\u2019ve got this level of misinformation it\u2019s going to affect the choices they make. That is a concern for us.\u201d Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, said \u201cThe [EA data] demonstrates that diesel cars can score well in real-world driving conditions. However, the star performers in the diesel category are few in number and these figures send out a strong message to several auto makers that they need to up their game.\u201d The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which represents the motor industry in the UK, said: \u201cThe differences between the results from official laboratory tests and those performed in the real world are well known, and industry acknowledges the need for fundamental reform of the current official test regime, which does it no favours.\u201d It was known before the VW scandal in September that many diesels produced more NOx emissions than the official limit when on the road, but the scandal led to specific carmakers and models being named. The EU revised the regulations in February, including the introduction of an emissions test involving more realistic driving conditions. But the policy was heavily criticised by campaigners for allowing new vehicles to continue to emit double the official limit until 2021 and 50% more afterwards. Unlike other parts of the world, European nations incentivised the use of diesel vehicles over the last 20 years because they emit less carbon dioxide per mile than petrol cars. Governments thought stricter regulation would sharply reduce NOx emissions, but carmakers found ways around the rules and governments failed to clamp down on the practices. The EA data is available for free to the public as the EQUA index. Molden said there was understandably a great deal of confusion among car buyers: \u201cBut we\u2019re able to deliver impartial and precise information to help them buy better.\u201d He said future regulation, such as ultra-low emission zones, would mean people choosing the cleanest cars would avoid charges. The index is overseen by a board of experts including Prof Helen ApSimon, at Imperial College London, and Dr Adam Boies, at the University of Cambridge. \u201cThe public can use it to avoid buying cars that are more harmful to human health,\u201d said ApSimon. Boies added: \u201cThe index will enable us to track the industry\u2019s effort to make meaningful reductions in noxious emissions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jobs, economic growth and tax reform will be priorities in thecoming federal budget, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has told a conference of the Australian Christian Lobby. Morrison spoke of the importance of supporting families and the need to create jobs, particularly for young people, during a speech to the ACL\u2019s national conference in Sydney on Saturday. \u201cGetting more young people into work is a priority for our government, it will be a priority in this budget,\u201d he told the audience. The treasurer has previously faced demands to pull out of addressing the conference because of his opposition to same-sex marriage and had also been attacked by the Greens for siding with \u201cbigots\u201d. The Australian Christian Lobby has called on the federal government to permanently override anti-discrimination laws to ensure those pushing for a no vote can speak their mind on same-sex marriage. The ACL\u2019s managing director, Lyle Shelton, has previously expressed concern that state anti-discrimination laws in particular have a low threshold, which could prevent a rigorous no campaign in the lead-up to a plebiscite. \u201cWe need to have the ability for a free debate in this plebiscite and at the moment, state-based anti-discrimination laws have a very low threshold for what constitutes discrimination,\u201d he has told Guardian Australia. Morrison used the ACL\u2019s national conference to spruik his budget before its delivery on May 3, and attack Labor\u2019s plans to limit negative gearing and cut the capital gains tax discount. Highlighting the importance of supporting families in the budget, he named key areas for action as jobs and growth, and a fairer and more sustainable tax system. \u201cI can assure you that families will be at the heart of the Turnbull government\u2019s budget,\u201d he told an audience of hundreds of delegates in Sydney on Saturday. He flagged a fairer and more flexible superannuation system to keep up with modern work patterns and to ensure fewer people go on the pension. Morrison also launched an attack on Labor\u2019s changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, which he said penalised families for investing in their future. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me for being a little political this morning ... there\u2019s an election coming,\u201d he said, to laughter from delegates. The government\u2019s plan to spend $5b over four years subsidising a public dental scheme also got a mention in Morrison\u2019s speech. But there was no word on reports middle-income families pushed into a higher tax bracket by inflation would get a modest tax cut to offset the \u201cbracket creep\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait until May 3,\u201d the treasurer told reporters outside the conference room. Labor was cynical about reports the government will give those who earn slightly more than $80,000 a modest tax cut to address \u201cbracket creep\u201d. The government has refused to confirm the reports, and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said \u201cpre-budget games\u201d were being played. \u201cThe only thing that I\u2019m sure about in this budget is that the wealthiest Australians and the largest multinationals will get tax cuts from Mr Turnbull,\u201d Shorten told reporters in western Sydney. Shorten also said dumped plans to give tax-levying powers to the states and increase the GST to 15% was a \u201cform guide\u201d to the government failing to push its tax reform agenda forward. In his speech to the ACL, Morrison also talked up his government\u2019s plan to spend $5b over four years subsidising a public dental scheme. However Labor says the Liberals have cut $1b to dental services. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the government had occupied \u201cjust about every possible position on tax\u201d in contrast to Labor\u2019s \u201chonest and upfront\u201d communication of its fiscal plan. Meanwhile the Greens\u2019 Adam Bandt called on Labor to side with his party and rule out a tax cuts \u201carms race\u201d against the government, saying taxes were the price paid for a civilised society.",
