      "body": "<p>It's easy to dismiss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/goldman-sachs-director-quits-morally-bankrupt\">Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs banker</a>, as a man with a grudge. This could be a classic case of sour grapes, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/goldman-sachs-why-i-resigned\">Smith's claim that his former employers were \"morally bankrupt\"</a> and described customers as \"muppets\" the result of him being overlooked in the dog-eat-dog world of investment banking.</p> <p>In the circumstances, though, it doesn't really matter whether Smith was a principled whistleblower or someone not really up to the job getting his own back. Why? Because his accusations had the ring of truth about them: what he said chimes not just with what Goldman's customers think of the Wall Street behemoth, but with the deep public suspicion that big finance is lining its own pockets at the expense of Main Street.</p> <p>That is an entirely justified suspicion and is a function of two developments \u2013 one long-term and one more recent. The big structural change on Wall Street and in the City of London has been for the investment banks to become bigger and more integrated. That means that one team goes round trying to persuade companies to float shares, a second team of analysts then pens supposedly independent analysis suggesting the shares are a great buy, while a third team of traders makes money every time the shares move up and down on the stock market. There is a massive conflict of interest here.</p> <p>There were obvious dangers in this process that stemmed from the gradual dismantling in the final quarter of the 20th century of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act\">the curbs placed</a> on Wall Street after the Great Depression in the 1930s. They were, however, masked until the second big development: the final crisis of 2007-08. This not only exposed \u2013 brutally and repeatedly \u2013 the follies of investment banks that had allowed their greed to get the better of their judgement, but also turned the big beasts of Wall Street into supplicants for taxpayer handouts.</p> <p>Those financiers who had spent the previous 15 years demanding that Washington get off the back of business suddenly found that there was case for government, after all \u2013 even if that only amounted to a willingness to write big cheques that would guarantee their annual bonuses. Rightly, ordinary voters were disgusted: privatising gain and socialising losses is not the way American capitalism (or any other form of it) is supposed to work.</p> <p>To rub salt in the wound, once the immediate crisis was over, Wall Street insisted that the burden of clearing up the financial mess that Wall Street created be shouldered by ordinary voters \u2013 through cuts in public spending.</p> <p>Where does this leave us? There are three conclusions from all this. The first is that Goldman Sachs has suffered reputational damage from the Smith attack. The public was tolerant of the excesses of the investment banking fraternity when times were good: when house prices are falling and real incomes are being squeezed, it tends to be less forgiving.

      "bodyText": "It's easy to dismiss Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs banker, as a man with a grudge. This could be a classic case of sour grapes, with Smith's claim that his former employers were \"morally bankrupt\" and described customers as \"muppets\" the result of him being overlooked in the dog-eat-dog world of investment banking. In the circumstances, though, it doesn't really matter whether Smith was a principled whistleblower or someone not really up to the job getting his own back. Why? Because his accusations had the ring of truth about them: what he said chimes not just with what Goldman's customers think of the Wall Street behemoth, but with the deep public suspicion that big finance is lining its own pockets at the expense of Main Street. That is an entirely justified suspicion and is a function of two developments \u2013 one long-term and one more recent. The big structural change on Wall Street and in the City of London has been for the investment banks to become bigger and more integrated. That means that one team goes round trying to persuade companies to float shares, a second team of analysts then pens supposedly independent analysis suggesting the shares are a great buy, while a third team of traders makes money every time the shares move up and down on the stock market. There is a massive conflict of interest here. There were obvious dangers in this process that stemmed from the gradual dismantling in the final quarter of the 20th century of the curbs placed on Wall Street after the Great Depression in the 1930s. They were, however, masked until the second big development: the final crisis of 2007-08. This not only exposed \u2013 brutally and repeatedly \u2013 the follies of investment banks that had allowed their greed to get the better of their judgement, but also turned the big beasts of Wall Street into supplicants for taxpayer handouts. Those financiers who had spent the previous 15 years demanding that Washington get off the back of business suddenly found that there was case for government, after all \u2013 even if that only amounted to a willingness to write big cheques that would guarantee their annual bonuses. Rightly, ordinary voters were disgusted: privatising gain and socialising losses is not the way American capitalism (or any other form of it) is supposed to work. To rub salt in the wound, once the immediate crisis was over, Wall Street insisted that the burden of clearing up the financial mess that Wall Street created be shouldered by ordinary voters \u2013 through cuts in public spending. Where does this leave us? There are three conclusions from all this. The first is that Goldman Sachs has suffered reputational damage from the Smith attack. The public was tolerant of the excesses of the investment banking fraternity when times were good: when house prices are falling and real incomes are being squeezed, it tends to be less forgiving. There is no great love lost between Goldmans and its corporate customers, either. The second conclusion is that it is time there was more competition in the investment banking industry. Returns on capital are high, and the reason for that is that the barriers are high for potential new entrants. It takes a lot of capital to set up an investment bank, which is why the industry operates as a self-serving oligopoly, rather than as a channel for productive investment in the real economy. The final conclusion, therefore, is that if the competition does not happen naturally through market forces (and there is no hint that it will), then a much tougher regulatory regime is needed \u2013 so that the corporate finance and trading arms of investment banks are split into different firms. That would limit the opportunity for conflict of interest and would cut the cost of finance to business. Above all, it would tackle what has become a colossal conspiracy by the super-rich against the general public.",

The bank said:</p> <blockquote> As hoped for, European property stocks have bounced strongly by 13% since 9 January 2012, as a result of the European Central Bank's LTRO [cheap loan programme] and Simon Property's stake purchase in Klepierre. We believe companies should speed up with value creation, find a bride or risk being shipped out. <br> M&amp;A [is set] to increase, as the sector is facing structural challenges and is trading at 29% discount to net asset value, while predators will exploit their relatively low cost of capital. We believe companies like Land Secs and in particular British Land should consider utilizing their low cost of capital for M&amp;A purposes (following alstria's recent example), perhaps in combination with demerging specialized vehicles. We welcome recent strategy changes from companies like Hammerson and Wereldhave, but companies need to speed up, as others will exploit their cost of capital advantage. In this context, Simon Property's Klepierre deal should be a wake-up call. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished just 4.71 points lower at 5940.72, as the International Monetary Fund approved its \u20ac28bn loan to Greece and investors shrugged off overnight news that Fitch had threatened the UK's Triple A credit rating. A reasonable set of US economic numbers, including better than expected weekly jobless claims, helped sentiment.</p> <p>Miners recovered some ground after recent worries about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodities. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 18p to 961.5p, while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 67.5p to 3547.5p.</p> <p>But <strong>Glencore</strong> dipped 1.15p to 412.2p. The company is said to be one of the potential bidders for Canadian grain specialist Viterra, whose shares were briefly suspended before it announced it had established a process for considering offers.</p> <p><strong>Essar Energy</strong> may be about to be kicked out of the FTSE 100 at the close of play on Friday following the latest quarterly reshuffle. But its shares added 1.2p to 113.6p after it completed another stage in the expansion of its Vadinar refinery in India. It has commissioned a diesel hydrotreater unit, leaving three more units to be brought on stream by the end of the month.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Next</strong> added 74p to \u00a329.01 after better than expected figures from rival H&amp;M and a buy note from Panmure Gordon ahead of next Thursday's full year figures. The broker said:</p> <blockquote> The company has already guided a 2012 pretax profit of \"\u00a37m either side of \u00a3565m\". Our estimate is \u00a3572.6m, at the top of this guided range. The focus next Thursday will be on any new guidance for 2013. The January statement guided the market to 2013 profits \"only slightly up\" on 2012. Our estimate of \u00a3593.1m implies 3.6% growth, around 1% ahead of consensus on \u00a3586.6m. With stable year on year selling prices and a very favourable input pricing environment, we think that 2013 guidance is probably too conservative. <br> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Tesco</strong> fell 3.1p to 321.75p following news that Richard Brasher, the supermarket's UK head, had quit the board with immediate effect.

      "bodyText": "Could there soon be a spate of acquisitions in the property sector? That is the theory put forward in a note from JP Morgan Cazenove, which names Big Yellow, up 2.8p at 324.3p, Hammerson, 0.7p better at 420.8p, Helical Bar, 3p higher at 184p, and Workspace, steady at 242p, among the likely bid targets. Predators could include British Land, 1.5p better at 502p, Land Securities, down 1.5p at 730p, and Simon Property, the US group which has just bought a near 29% stake in French real estate company Klepiere. The bank said: As hoped for, European property stocks have bounced strongly by 13% since 9 January 2012, as a result of the European Central Bank's LTRO [cheap loan programme] and Simon Property's stake purchase in Klepierre. We believe companies should speed up with value creation, find a bride or risk being shipped out. M&amp;A [is set] to increase, as the sector is facing structural challenges and is trading at 29% discount to net asset value, while predators will exploit their relatively low cost of capital. We believe companies like Land Secs and in particular British Land should consider utilizing their low cost of capital for M&amp;A purposes (following alstria's recent example), perhaps in combination with demerging specialized vehicles. We welcome recent strategy changes from companies like Hammerson and Wereldhave, but companies need to speed up, as others will exploit their cost of capital advantage. In this context, Simon Property's Klepierre deal should be a wake-up call. Overall the FTSE 100 finished just 4.71 points lower at 5940.72, as the International Monetary Fund approved its \u20ac28bn loan to Greece and investors shrugged off overnight news that Fitch had threatened the UK's Triple A credit rating. A reasonable set of US economic numbers, including better than expected weekly jobless claims, helped sentiment. Miners recovered some ground after recent worries about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodities. Kazakhmys climbed 18p to 961.5p, while Rio Tinto rose 67.5p to 3547.5p. But Glencore dipped 1.15p to 412.2p. The company is said to be one of the potential bidders for Canadian grain specialist Viterra, whose shares were briefly suspended before it announced it had established a process for considering offers. Essar Energy may be about to be kicked out of the FTSE 100 at the close of play on Friday following the latest quarterly reshuffle. But its shares added 1.2p to 113.6p after it completed another stage in the expansion of its Vadinar refinery in India. It has commissioned a diesel hydrotreater unit, leaving three more units to be brought on stream by the end of the month. Elsewhere Next added 74p to \u00a329.01 after better than expected figures from rival H&amp;M and a buy note from Panmure Gordon ahead of next Thursday's full year figures. The broker said: The company has already guided a 2012 pretax profit of \"\u00a37m either side of \u00a3565m\". Our estimate is \u00a3572.6m, at the top of this guided range. The focus next Thursday will be on any new guidance for 2013. The January statement guided the market to 2013 profits \"only slightly up\" on 2012. Our estimate of \u00a3593.1m implies 3.6% growth, around 1% ahead of consensus on \u00a3586.6m. With stable year on year selling prices and a very favourable input pricing environment, we think that 2013 guidance is probably too conservative. But Tesco fell 3.1p to 321.75p following news that Richard Brasher, the supermarket's UK head, had quit the board with immediate effect. In January the group issued a shock profit warning, and admitted it needed to improve customer service. Whitbread dipped 8p to \u00a3179.10 after Investec began coverage with a sell recommendation. Analyst James Hollins said: We believe the Whitbread bull case is running out of steam.

The shares are at a premium to our 1,450p price target, and with limited catalysts to drive the shares higher on a 12-month view, we initiate with a sell. Shares in Shire slid 70p to \u00a321.58 after the pharmaceutical group withdrew a US licence application for its treatment for Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder, after signs regulators wanted more tests on the drug. Shire had been supplying the drug Replagal in the US for around two years - it has been on the market in Europe since 2001 - following manufacturing problems with rival treatment Fabrzyme, made by Genzyme. The company also announced the purchase of US biotech firm FerroKin BioSciences for up to $325m. GlaxoSmithKline edged up 1p to \u00a314.31 as the company agreed the sale of a number of its European over-the-counter brands including Zantac and hayfever spray Beconase to Belgium's Omega Pharma. The net cash proceeds of \u00a3310m will be returned to shareholders.

      "bodyText": "In one sense, the warning from Fitch that it might strip the UK of its AAA rating is good news for George Osborne.

      "bodyText": "Oil has been struck off the County Cork coast in a potentially multibillion-pound discovery that could help to drag Ireland's recession-stricken economy out of the mire. Dublin-based Providence Resources announced on Thursday that oil has successfully started to flow from its Barryroe well in the first big find in Irish territorial waters. The oilfield, which is about 50 kilometres off the Cork coast, has a flow of more than 3,500 barrels a day, a number which exceeds the company's original projections of 1,800 barrels. One recent audit of the area found that it might contain the potential to produce almost 1bn barrels of oil, making the field worth billions at today's crude prices of well over $100 a barrel. The test area off the Cork coast covered 300 sq km, which according to Providence is equivalent to a medium-to-large North Sea oil field. The oil was discovered at a depth of about 100 metres in the sea bed. Successful drilling at the Barryroe well will increase pressure on the Irish government to grant permission for oil exploration at five further sites in Irish waters. These include the most controversial site, at Dalkey Island in Dublin Bay, close to an exclusive stretch of the capital's coastline which is home to Irish rock stars such as Bono and Enya. If an oil rig were constructed near the uninhabited island it would be in the line of sight of homes belonging to celebrities on Dublin's so-called \"gold coast\". An alliance of community groups in one of the richest parts of Ireland as well as conservation groups such as Birdwatch Ireland and An Taisce, the republic's National Trust, are understood to be planning a campaign against the drilling project. The island is home to a seal colony and the waters around it are used for fishing pollock and mackerel as well sea diving. Providence Resources, whose chief executive is Tony O'Reilly Jr, the son of the former boss of Independent News and Media, said it was pleased the flow rates from Barryroe were higher than the pre-drilling target. O'Reilly said the discovery was a \"seminal day for Ireland, especially in the runup to St Patrick's Day\". Of the higher than expected oil flows he said: \"As the Americans say, 'We didn't hit a home run, we knocked the ball out of the park'. I think this discovery also creates a reappraisal in the minds of global oil corporations about coming back to Irish waters to drill for oil. Irish territorial waters are massively under-explored.\" The oil was of good quality, described as \"light but waxy crude\". O'Reilly said the company was exploring for oil in Northern Ireland near Rathlin Island and he hoped the Barryroe find would lead to the creation of an onshore oil industry in Ireland. \"We've always said as an Irish company we want to use as much Irish infrastructure and resources as we can. We don't have an oil industry in Ireland at present but I hope something like Barryroe and the success we are getting in that will thrive more interest in creating more of an infrastructure in Ireland.\" While the find is small by the standards of the Middle East or even the North Sea it could reduce the republic's national energy bill and have a significant spinoff for the entire economy. Ireland is heavily dependent on imported oil and gas. The Irish Offshore Operators' Association points out that more than 90% of Irish gas is imported while oil accounts for nearly 60% of overall Irish energy consumption. Fergus Cahill of the Irish Offshore Operators' Association said: \"It's very encouraging and positive. First of all it's the first discovery in Irish waters that looks to be declared commercial. The flow rates are encouraging. Secondly, it will encourage other explorers because one of the problems that have dogged Ireland has been the explorations in the past. Almost all of these discoveries were of gas, not oil. If it gets developed, which we hope it will, it will reduce our dependency on imports, increase taxation revenue and create jobs.\" The Irish exchequer will benefit from the potential oil boom as the republic's department of finance gains a 25% tax take from any oil or gas revenues.",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone crisis and the sucker punch it delivered to the UK banking sector is at the heart of the UK's current economic woes, a Bank of England policymaker said on Thursday, giving support to the chancellor's view that external forces are largely to blame for the country's current predicament. Ben Broadbent, a Goldman Sachs economist who joined the central bank's monetary policy committee last year, also warned that interest rates could start to climb as soon as the eurozone crisis is resolved. In a speech to City executives, he said an analysis of the last decade showed that dealing with the massive debts racked up by UK banks ahead of the Lehman Brothers collapse is more significant to exiting the recession than driving down household debts. Banks faced a double whammy from the euro crisis, which triggered a second credit crunch and restricted their ability to restructure an exposure to loans across the world. \"What distinguished the UK, more than the indebtedness of its non-financial private sector, was the size of its banks' overseas balance sheets,\" he said. \"To the extent that any single thing can be a useful diagnostic on the state of credit markets, and the prospects for sustainable recovery, it is therefore more likely to be found directly in the UK banking system (its funding costs, for example) than in the domestic non-financial sector. \"And though the latter can affect the former, it remains the case that the most important risks facing the UK banks, and therefore the supply of domestic credit, emanate from outside the UK.\" Households spent much of the 1990s and 2000s building up debts, mainly through an escalation of mortgage loans. But older households who sold at the top of the market largely invested their gains in other savings products and pensions, leaving the net position of the household sector roughly the same as in 1990, said Broadbent. He said this development had huge implications for the intergenerational transfer of wealth from young people forced to take on larger mortgages and older people who sold their homes, but meant the rise in bank debts was related to commercial and international loans.

In January HMV won critical support from film house and record label suppliers which enabled chief executive Simon Fox to secure essential concessions from the group's lending banks led by taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. HMV has closed stores and sold off its Waterstones business in an effort to pay down debts to more manageable levels, but borrowings remain uncomfortably high. In January Fox said he believed net debt would reach somewhere between \u00a3175m and \u00a3180m by the end of April, but \u2013 based on prevailing trading patterns \u2013 can be halved within three years.

      "bodyText": "Major high street food outlets such as Costa Coffee, Pizza Express and Garfunkels have shunned a major government initiative to reduce obesity by telling diners how many calories their products contain. A host of well-known food and drink producers and retailers have refused to join what ministers billed as a significant drive by such businesses to help consumers lead healthier lives by reducing salt in their goods, ending the use of trans fats and publishing calorie counts. Popular chains such as Cafe Rouge and Caffe Nero, budget supermarkets Lidl and Iceland and the makers of Birds Eye fish fingers are also among those who have not agreed to honour at least one of three pledges made health secretary Andrew Lansley when he unveiled his public health responsibility deal a year ago. The non co-operation is disclosed in a new report by the consumer group Which?, which claims that the first year of Lansley's controversial system of relying on voluntary agreements with the food and drink industry, rather than regulation, to improve public health has been a failure.
