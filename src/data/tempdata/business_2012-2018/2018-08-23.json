      "bodyText": "Volkswagen and Seat have been accused by consumer group Which? of selling thousands of vehicles with a known dangerous and unsolved rear seatbelt fault. In May, independent tests by Finnish magazine Tekniikan Maailma found that when all three rear seatbelts were used in VW Polos and Seat models driven at speed, the back-left seatbelt could come undone, leaving a passenger at risk of serious injury in the event of a crash. Since the test, Volkswagen Group has recalled about 12,000 new VW Polos and thousands more Seat Ibizas and Aronas to install a temporary fix. This involves securing the central and back-left seatbelt buckles together. Which? said the company has continued selling new cars with the same known fault \u2013 a fault that it has confirmed it will not be able to resolve until November. The problem affects more than 68,000 Polo and Seat cars in the UK. The company told Which? that it will \u201cin due course\u201d be issuing affected owners with a sticker warning them not to use the rear middle seat. Alex Neill, a managing director at Which?, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that VW and Seat are selling thousands of cars that they know have a serious safety issue but don\u2019t yet have a proper fix for. They should not be selling these potentially dangerous vehicles at all. Supplying a warning sticker is a startlingly inadequate response.\u201d She said this case, as well as a BMW recall earlier this year, had exposed crucial failings in the way cars were recalled in the UK. Which? has called for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency to be given enforcement powers to hold car manufacturers to account. It is the latest setback for VW, which this week saw protesters blockade its Milton Keynes UK headquarters in protest over diesel emissions. On Monday, it was reported the company has had to recall about 700,000 Tiguan and Touran cars worldwide due to a possible lighting defect that could set the vehicle on fire. A VW spokesman said the affected the cars remain safe to drive. \u201cThere is the possibility that in extremely rare situations (eg sudden, abrupt lane changes with five occupants on board) the left seatbelt lock could be unintentionally released. At Volkswagen and Seat safety remains a top priority and the brands have already identified a technical solution: a redesigned belt lock fixture, which will prevent this happening. A permanent solution is scheduled to be available in November. \u201cWe have asked retailers to ensure that all prospective purchasers of affected new or used vehicles are made aware of the current guidance not to use the middle rear seat.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 August 2018 to correct a reference to Alex Neill; she is managing director of home products and services at Which?.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve seen the future of banking. Those fintechs clustered around London\u2019s \u201cSilicon roundabout\u201d, such as Monzo (900,000 current account customers already) and Revolut (2 million customers since launch in 2015) have attracted smartphone-obsessed millennials with their digital prowess. But a new bank quietly launched on Thursday, called Marcus, turns the conventional fintech story upside down. Marcus is not on Silicon roundabout. The boss isn\u2019t 25 years old, does not have a beard, and in his PR shots even sports a tie. The horror. Nor does he have \u00a350m in cash from a venture capital outfit to burn through ahead of an IPO in five years\u2019 time. What marks out Marcus is that it\u2019s an offshoot of an incumbent big bank. And not any old bank, but the gorilla in the jungle: Goldman Sachs. Neither is it about high net worth individuals, prime accounts and gold or platinum cards. Marcus is aimed squarely at the middle of the retail market, as Goldman Sachs makes a dramatic shift from Wall Street to Main Street. Marcus launched in the US two years ago, and has already garnered $20bn in deposits. It offers easy access savings accounts that can be opened with just one dollar that Goldman claims pay four times the average interest at other US banks. Its personal loan rates are some of the lowest in the country, and it has even signalled its interest in the less-than-prime market, with credit card consolidation deals for those drowning in debt. In the UK there are few details of products yet, but if reports of a 1.5% easy access interest rate are true, then Marcus will immediately leapfrog Virgin and Sainsbury\u2019s Bank to the top of the savings best buy tables. That said, it remains to be seen whether these are just teaser rates that in a few years will drop down the tables. Four months ago, it snapped up personal finance app Clarity Money to help create its mobile shop front. Marcus is hoping to mix the muscle of Goldman Sachs with the fleet-footedness of a branch-free start-up. But Marcus will have to tread carefully. Regulators don\u2019t like the big beasts elbowing out startups; BT was forced to open its broadband network to rivals, while the energy giants were effectively ordered to subsidise their smaller rivals. The biggest challenge for Marcus will be making money. It\u2019s not something most fintechs manage for years, with their venture capital owners happy to pour millions into grabbing market share. Monzo cheerfully talks of building 1 billion customers and making most of its money when it gets there. Goldman Sachs shareholders are unlikely to be so indulgent. Crosswinds force Ryanair to alter course Ryanair shares have been lifted out of a tailspin after a 22-hour marathon meeting resulted in the Irish airline reaching a provisional agreement with pilots union F\u00f3rsa. Chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary still has a lot more staff to win over before a summer of strikes becomes a bad memory, but investors have seen the deal as a significant moment. Conciliation, if it proves to be, is a far cry from a few weeks ago when Ryanair was bullishly talking of moving planes out of Ireland and condemning F\u00f3rsa as agents of rival Aer Lingus. But pilots, who had long grumbled but feared to stick their heads above the parapet, are now holding the whip hand. Passengers may once have been, as O\u2019Leary used to maintain, undeterred by negative publicity around the airline, and only interested in his kind of customer service: low fares and efficiency. Certainly, the airline has been wooing its customers with ever lower fares of late. But Ryanair\u2019s allure was also simple reliability and punctuality. The likelihood of strikes and cancellations is making many regular travellers think again. Even if O\u2019Leary was right that most couldn\u2019t give a hoot about working conditions, they do care about getting to their destinations on time. Ryanair\u2019s dubious reputation for making amends has taken a further hit through issuing unsigned, bouncing compensation cheques. Saving money upfront on a Ryanair fare has started to look less a prudent financial choice than a gamble with the summer holiday. Pilots \u2013 and even cabin crew \u2013 have now seen they can apply pressure and win concessions, after years of arrogant dismissal from HQ. Quite where the airline, which has always been a clear market leader in keeping costs and fares low, ends up remains to be seen: but with other European unions yet to settle, O\u2019Leary may yet have more humble pie to eat.

      "bodyText": "On 2 March 1938, Saudi Arabia was a largely nomadic society with a sideline in the tourism generated by pilgrimages to Mecca. The following day, oil was discovered at Dharam and the country\u2019s prospects were transformed for ever. It took time for the full extent of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude reserves to become known, not least because in early 1938 the world had other things on its mind. But by the time the second world war was over, it was clear that beneath the desert sands there was an abundance of oil that could be easily brought out of the ground. Cheap Saudi oil was a vital component of the world economy\u2019s long post-war boom and the revenues from petroleum exports paid for roads, bridges, apartment blocks and western-style living standards. But there was a downside. The economy of Saudi Arabia was and is dangerously dependent on oil, which accounts for 87% of its budget revenues, more than 40% of its GDP and 90% of its export earnings. For the Saudi economy to work, the oil fields had to keep pumping and the global price of crude needed to stay high. When the cost of crude was more than $100 a barrel, Saudi\u2019s rulers could keep taxes low and welfare spending high, while investing more in infrastructure spending. They could spend heavily on defence and compete with Iran to be a regional superpower. The go-ahead for the kilometre-high Jeddah tower, which will be the world\u2019s tallest building when it is opened next year, was given when oil prices hit $120 a barrel. But then two things happened. The first was that the price of oil fell below $100 a barrel in 2014 and has not recovered since. By early 2016, a barrel of crude was changing hands for less than $30 a barrel \u2013 a price crash that resulted in a recession and a ballooning budget deficit. The second was that the world started to get more serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the Paris climate change conference in 2015, an agreement was signed committing the international community to steps that would limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels For the Saudis, the implications of the Paris agreement were obvious: the drive to decarbonise the world economy would mean that a considerable part of their oil reserves would have to stay in the ground. This made a warning at the turn of the millennium by the former Saudi energy minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, seem suddenly urgent. \u201cThirty years from now, there will be a huge amount of oil \u2013 and no buyers\u201d, Yamani said. \u201cOil will be left in the ground. The stone age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.\u201d It was not long before Saudi\u2019s rulers responded to this twin challenge. In the short term, they sought to persuade fellow oil producing nations to agree production curbs that would limit supply, drive up crude prices and so ease the pressures on the public finances. At the current oil price of around $70 a barrel, the Saudis can make their budget arithmetic stack up. In the longer term, there was a plan to diversify the economy away from oil. Saudi Vision 2030 was announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April 2016, shortly after the oil price reached its trough. The idea was to make Saudi Arabia a global investment giant, to turn the country into a hub linking the three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa and to be the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The proposed sale of part of the state-owned oil company - Saudi Aramco - was a key part of this attempt to transform and modernise the economy. Proceeds were earmarked for the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund so it could continue investing in companies such as the electric car company Tesla and the ride-hailing app Uber. Vision 2030 is strongly supported by the International Monetary Fund, which has praised the plan for its boldness. Yet there is far to go. The economy is dependent on 6 million foreign workers and female participation in the labour market is weak, despite the recent lifting of the ban on women driving. Riyadh is under pressure over its crackdown on dissent and the civilian casualties in Yemen, where it is fighting a proxy war with Iran. The postponement of the Saudi Aramco float \u2013 although the government said it remained committed to an IPO at some point \u2013 may have less to do with the state of financial markets than the unwillingness of the Saudis to come clean about the state of the company and the extent of oil reserves. Saudi Arabia remains a deeply conservative country. Just as with an oil supertanker, changing course will take time.",

      "body": "<p>On 2 March 1938, Saudi Arabia was a largely nomadic society with a sideline in the tourism generated by pilgrimages to Mecca. <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/mar3/oil-discovered-saudi-arabia/\">The following day, oil was discovered </a>at Dharam and the country\u2019s prospects were transformed for ever.</p> <p>It took time for the full extent of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude reserves to become known, not least because in early 1938 the world had other things on its mind. But by the time the second world war was over, it was clear that beneath the desert sands there was an abundance of oil that could be easily brought out of the ground. Cheap Saudi oil was a vital component of the world economy\u2019s long post-war boom and the revenues from petroleum exports paid for roads, bridges, apartment blocks and western-style living standards.</p> <p>But there was a downside. The economy of Saudi Arabia was and is dangerously dependent on oil, which accounts for <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html\">87% of its budget revenues</a>, more than 40% of its GDP and 90% of its export earnings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2018-08-23T15:44:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"saudi gdp\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2018-08-23T15:44:08/embed.html\">saudi gdp</a> </figure>  <p>For the Saudi economy to work, the oil fields had to keep pumping and the global price of crude needed to stay high. When the cost of crude was more than $100 a barrel, Saudi\u2019s rulers could keep taxes low and welfare spending high, while investing more in infrastructure spending. They could spend heavily on defence and compete with Iran to be a regional superpower. The go-ahead for the kilometre-high Jeddah tower, which will be the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah_Tower\">world\u2019s tallest building</a> when it is opened next year, was given when oil prices hit $120 a barrel.</p> <p>But then two things happened. The first was that the price of oil fell below $100 a barrel in 2014 and has not recovered since. By early 2016, a barrel of crude was changing hands for less than $30 a barrel \u2013 a price crash that resulted in a recession and a ballooning budget deficit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2018-08-23T17:36:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"crude prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2018-08-23T17:36:03/embed.html\">crude prices</a> </figure>  <p>The second was that the world started to get more serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the Paris climate change conference in 2015, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">agreement was signed</a> committing the international community to steps that would limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels</p> <p>For the Saudis, the implications of the Paris agreement were obvious: the drive to decarbonise the world economy would mean that a considerable part of their oil reserves would have to stay in the ground. This made a warning at the turn of the millennium by the former Saudi energy minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, seem suddenly urgent.</p> <p>\u201cThirty years from now, there will be a huge amount of oil \u2013 and no buyers\u201d, Yamani said. \u201cOil will be left in the ground. The stone age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.\u201d</p> <p>It was not long before Saudi\u2019s rulers responded to this twin challenge. In the short term, they sought to persuade fellow oil producing nations to agree production curbs that would limit supply, drive up crude prices and so ease the pressures on the public finances. At the current oil price of around $70 a barrel, the Saudis can make their budget arithmetic stack up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/23/oil-giant-aramcos-2tn-flotation-is-still-on-says-saudi-arabia\">Oil giant Aramco's $2tn flotation is still on, says Saudi Arabia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the longer term, there was a plan to diversify the economy away from oil. Saudi Vision 2030 was announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April 2016, shortly after the oil price reached its trough. The idea was to make Saudi Arabia a global investment giant, to turn the country into a hub linking the three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa and to be the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds.</p> <p>The proposed sale of part of the state-owned oil company - Saudi Aramco - was a key part of this attempt to transform and modernise the economy. Proceeds were earmarked for the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund so it could continue investing in companies such as the electric car company Tesla and the ride-hailing app Uber.</p> <p>Vision 2030 is strongly supported by the International Monetary Fund, which has praised the plan for its boldness. Yet there is far to go. The economy is dependent on 6 million foreign workers and female participation in the labour market is weak, despite the recent lifting of the ban on women driving. Riyadh is under pressure over its crackdown on dissent and the civilian casualties in Yemen, where it is fighting a proxy war with Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The postponement of the Saudi Aramco float \u2013 although the government said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/23/oil-giant-aramcos-2tn-flotation-is-still-on-says-saudi-arabia\">remained committed to an IPO</a> at some point \u2013 may have less to do with the state of financial markets than the unwillingness of the Saudis to come clean about the state of the company and the extent of oil reserves.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Markets remain nervous thanks to a combination of an escalation in the US-China trade tensions, the uncertainty over how the current situation with President Trump will play out and a mixed picture from the eurozone economy. Preliminary purchasing manager surveys for August show French business activity hitting a four month high, while Germany\u2019s service sector did well but manufacturing slipped back and the overall eurozone figure was disappointing. And the minutes from the European Central Bank\u2019s July meeting showed it was concerned about protectionism and the escalation of trade disputes. The dollar edged higher for the first time in six trading sessions, helped by the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes suggesting more interest rate rises were on the way despite Trump\u2019s displeasure at such a policy. Elsewhere UK retail sales grew more strongly than expected, thanks mainly to the heatwave boosting sales of food and drink for barbecues and outdoor parties. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The minutes suggest a rate rise in just over a year from now, in September 2019, says one ECB watcher: The threat of a global trade war and increased protectionism are the main risks for the eurozone economy, according to the minutes of July\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank. Otherwise, the bloc\u2019s growth was on track, the ECB believed which is why there was little disagreement on leaving its policy unchanged. It had already announced in June it would end its bond buying programme by the end of the year and keep interest rates steady at least until next summer. On trade tensions, the minutes said: Uncertainties related to global factors remained prominent, in particular with regard to the threat of protectionism and the risk of an escalation of trade tensions...These tensions could generate a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. The dollar has rallied for the first time in six trading sessions, following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes which suggested further rate rises this year despite Donald Trump\u2019s displeasure. News of the new round of trade tariffs from the US and China also helped the greenback, given its status as a haven in uncertainty. So the dollar added 0.07% against a basket of currencies, while the pound dipped 0.15% to $1.2890. Sterling is also being affected by continued Brexit uncertainties, as the UK government spells out some of the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. The proposed merger between supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda will be investigated by the UK\u2019s competition and markets authority. The CMA said it will begin a detailed assessment into how any deal would affect competition for UK shoppers, and whether it would lead to less choice or higher prices. It will also investigate whether the deal would allow the merged company to squeeze suppliers. The companies have asked for a fast track inquiry, and the CMA will accept this unless there are \u201cvalid objections.\u201d With markets continuing to drift, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Thursday continued to be more notable for what didn\u2019t happen than what did, with the FTSE avoiding the red despite a rocky set of mining stocks. The UK index spent the morning flat at 7580, the gains from the likes of BP and Shell \u2013 Brent Crude shot up to $75 per barrel on Wednesday, though has pulled back below $74.50 this Thursday \u2013 countering the losses seen from Rio Tinto, Anglo American et al. Helping the FTSE was a disappointing session for the pound. Having built up a head of steam against the dollar \u2013 admittedly one that is pretty paltry in comparison to its recent losses \u2013 sterling saw its rebound nipped in the bud by a hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday night, with cable slipping 0.3% to fall beneath $1.287. And even though the Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and services PMIs weren\u2019t great, the euro also managed to have the edge over the pound, the single currency climbing 0.2%. Turning to this afternoon, and with the US-China trade war heating up with the latest bout of tit-for-tat tariffing just as talks get back underway, the Dow Jones isn\u2019t looking like it fancies doing much when the bell rings on Wall Street. The futures have the Dow dipping 25 or so points when the US session gets underway, a move that keeps it below the 25750 mark it has struggled to really push beyond with any longevity in the last few days. The CBI says the hot weather in August kept people spending, but the outlook is not so positive. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: The summer heatwave has kept shoppers out on the high street, with consumers splurging on food and drink for barbecues and garden parties. That said, the outlook for retail remains challenging, with orders falling, prices rising, employment sliding, and investment drifting down. The long-term challenges facing the retail sector are significant and won\u2019t be resolved overnight. Subdued real wage growth and digital disruption continue to pile pressure on firms, while high street retailers continue to suffer under an out-dated business rates system. Signs of strength in the UK high street. The latest distributive trades survey from the CBI shows a positive balance of 29 in August, compared to an expected fall to +13 from +20 in July. But the expected employment index - a quarterly index - fell to -35 in August, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2009 and down from a flat level in May. China\u2019s retaliatory measures following the latest US tariff move are more aggressive than expected, says ING Bank economist Iris Pang: The $16bn revised tariff list from China includes medical equipment and automobiles when the US administration would like to help American automobiles fare better in the international market. We see this list as more punchy than the previous one even the amount involved stays the same at $16bn... The uncertainty now lies in how China would retaliate qualitatively and this the main concern for markets rather than today\u2019s tariffs implementation. If the trade talks between China and the US do not yield positive results this week, the US is set to impose another 25% tariffs on $200bn of imported goods from China. The amount would be around half of the goods US imports from China, but China will only retaliate with tariffs on $60bn because the US doesn\u2019t export as much. But China has repeatedly stated that it can retaliate qualitatively. Qualitative retaliations could include placing administrative measures on US companies operating in China or following the US lead and leveraging \u2018national security\u2019 to prevent some American companies operating in the country. Given that \u2018national security\u2019 examination has recently been added as a clause in foreigners\u2019 investment policies in China, this seems like a possibility. US markets are expected to open fairly flat, as investors remain cautious in the wake of the trade tensions and President Trump\u2019s troubles. Most European markets are also virtually unmoved at the moment, but analysts are nervous about how long the hiatus will last. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Early hesitancy for European markets reflects the ongoing political instability in the US, alongside uncertainty as the US-China trade talks come to a head ... The ongoing fears over the snowballing political picture in the US ... remain a driver of risk aversion in the US, with European markets largely outperforming in recent days. Comments from Trump that he did not break election campaign rules are far from allaying market fears, and there is a growing fear that this crisis could drive substantial losses at the mid-term elections in November .... Today sees the US-China trade talks come to a head, with low market expectations likely to drive the response to any final announcement. There seems to be little headway being make over the months, and the inability of the Chinese to appease Trump\u2019s demands mean that this is likely to rumble on for some time yet. However, with the bar set so low, there is also the potential for some sort of half-hearted announcement which sets out an agreement to work towards specific targets, in a similar ilk to that seen with the EU. The trade tensions between the US and China are more likely to deteriorate this year and dampen global growth in 2019, according to Moody\u2019s. In its latest global outlook report, Moody\u2019s says there are early signs that global growth has peaked. It expects the G20 countries to grow by 3.3% in 2018 and 3.1% in 2019. The advanced economies will grow 2.3% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, while G20 emerging markets will remain the growth drivers, at 5.1% in both 2018 and 2019. But it added that \u201cfurther tariffs, similar in magnitude to the newly proposed 25% US tariffs on $200bn of imports from China and 25% US tariffs on all auto and auto part imports, represent a disruptive downside risk to our baseline forecasts.\u201d Madhavi Bokil, Moody\u2019s vice-president and lead author of the report, said: Most of the impact of the trade restrictions on economic growth will be felt in 2019. The magnitude of the macro impacts will depend on market sentiment. Tightening of financial conditions through asset price and currency adjustment and a broader hit to business and consumer confidence are now more likely than a few months ago and have the potential to derail the global economy. Back with the trade wars, and here is our latest report on the new tariffs: The US and China have escalated their ongoing trade war by implementing 25% tariffs on $16bn worth of imports on both sides, bringing the amount levied to a combined $100bn (\u00a378bn) since July. Beijing began implementing the new tariffs on Thursday, when the US said it would begin collecting extra duties in retaliation for what it claimed were unfair Chinese trade practices. \u201cChina firmly opposes [the US tariffs] and has to continue to make necessary counterattacks,\u201d China\u2019s ministry of commerce said in a statement. The latest round of tariffs comes as Chinese and US officials are due to meet in Washington for talks that few expect will bring an end to months of tit-for-tat threats and tariffs. On Monday, Donald Trump told Reuters he did not \u201canticipate much\u201d from the negotiations in Washington. The US president said any resolution would \u201ctake time because China\u2019s done too well for too long, and they\u2019ve become spoiled\u201d. The White House claims China steals foreign companies\u2019 intellectual property or forces them to give it up, and that industrial subsidy programmes unfairly benefit Chinese businesses. The latest round of US tariffs target electronics, plastics, chemicals, semiconductors and other goods from the \u201cMade in China\u201d industrial plan to upgrade Chinese manufacturing capabilities. The full story is here: The eurozone data will not make easy reading for the European Central Bank or its president, Mario Draghi, suggests Balraj Sroya, sales trader at foreign exchange specialist Foenix Partners: The ECB\u2019s monetary policy plans could be derailed as trade war fears have impacted PMI figures from the bloc state. While both the services and manufacturing PMI prints from the eurozone showed expansion in each respective sector, the manufacturing figure fell to 20-month lows of 54.6. Recently Inflation and economic growth have exceeded the ECB\u2019s targets. However, the central bank\u2019s Quantitative Easing tapering strategy could be derailed if feeble data such as today\u2019s PMI prints continue while adding fuel to an already cautious Draghi. Eurozone business growth picked up but at a slower pace than expected, with the prospects of a trade war hitting the outlook for manufacturers. The IHS Markit preliminary composite PMI - which includes both the manufacturing and service sectors - came in at 54.4 in August, up from 54.3 the previous month but marginally below the forecast 54.5. The rate of expansion was one of the weakest seen over the past year and a half, said Markit. Companies expectations of growth slipped to the lowest for nearly two years. The services PMI rose from 54.2 to 54.4, in line with expectations. But the manufacturing index fell from 55.1 to 54.6, the lowest since November 2016 and below the expected 55. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit warned of warning lights flashing. He said: The survey data indicate that the eurozone economy looks to have continued to grow at a steady rate in August, raising hopes that the third quarter could see GDP growth match the 0.4% expansion seen in the second quarter. In fact, the survey evidence suggests that the official data so far this year could yet be revised slightly higher. Jobs growth also remains encouragingly robust, which should help further stimulate consumer spending and help offset signs of continuing weakness in exports. With the indicators of current activity, employment and price gauges remaining elevated, the August survey sends a hawkish signal to policymakers. But the forward-looking indicators suggest the business mood could cool as summer passes. Warning lights are flashing. Analysis of past data indicates that demand needs to pick up to sustain current output and employment growth in coming months. Yet the risks seem tilted to the downside. Escalating political worries, rising prices and a recent slowdown in order book growth have all contributed to the gloomiest outlook for almost two years, according to companies\u2019 expectations of their future output. In manufacturing, optimism is down to its lowest for almost three years, as a near- stalling of exports corroborated escalating trade war worries. With manufacturing looking the most susceptible to a trade-led slowdown in coming months, hopes are pinned on a robust service sector helping to drive economic growth as we move into the autumn, yet even here optimism is down to its lowest for nearly two years. Back with the German PMIs: Investors remain cautious, with markets continuing to drift. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, said: Markets traded either side of breakeven in early trade as tariffs threatened by both the US and China came into effect overnight. And there\u2019s a real risk to global economic growth if the US slaps duties on another $200bn of Chinese goods, and especially if other countries get sucked into this dispute. At a time when other economies are beginning to struggle, a sharp slowdown in US expansion could have a significant impact worldwide. These developments come at a particularly sensitive time for a UK stock market rangebound for the past three months. September is statistically the worst month of the year for UK shares, but there have been wild swings either way in recent years, so don\u2019t expect this stale period to last. Germany\u2019s business activity hit a six month high, with a strong service sector making up for weakness manufacturing as global trade tensions rise. The IHS Markit preliminary composite PMI rose from 55 in July to 55.7, better than the expected 55.2. But the manufacturing index fell from 56.9 to a lower than forecast 56.1. The service sector rose from 54.1 to 55.2. Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit said: German business continued to display remarkable resilience during August, with the latest PMI data going some way to dispel any fears about a global trade slowdown and its impact on the health of the economy. Buoyed by strong fundamentals in the domestic market, including rising employment and wages, the service sector enjoyed an upturn in growth in August and drove the steepest rise in private sector business activity for six months. While the manufacturing PMI retreated slightly, it remained well inside growth territory at the mid- point in the third quarter. The top-line number is perhaps flattered by the output component, with trends in new orders and exports \u2013 the latter the weakest in over two years \u2013 pointing to a softer pace of growth. Elsewhere, the survey\u2019s measure of prices charged for goods and services edged closer to January\u2019s survey-record peak, to suggest the potential for some renewed upward pressure on the headline inflation rate in coming months. France has reported better than expected growth in August, according to a preliminary survey of the country\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors. IHS Markit\u2019s composite purchasing managers index - which combines the two sectors - rose from 54.4 in July to 55.1 this month. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around 54.6. The index has been above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction for the 26th month in a row. The manufacturing PMI rose from 53.3 to 53.7 while the service sector index increased from 54.9 to 55.7. Sam Teague, economist at IHS Markit said: Output growth across the French private sector ticked up to a four-month high in August, with both the service and manufacturing sectors seeing stronger expansions. Robust domestic client demand, alongside a renewed upturn in exports provided stimulus for the latest acceleration in growth. A key theme in the latest survey were the sharp inflationary pressures reported in the manufacturing sector, with many respondents blaming higher oil- related input cost burdens. This in turn placed downward pressure on confidence towards expected output growth over the next year. That said, despite optimism slipping in August, French businesses continued to hire additional staff at an elevated pace, partly reflecting rising output requirements. The new round of tit-for-tat trade tariffs between the US and China, the prospect of a US rate rise next month and Donald Trump\u2019s growing problems have cast a shadow over European markets at the open. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, up just 0.05%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.07% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.11%. Here are the opening calls for the European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The bull run in the US market may have broken a new record on Wednesday, but investors have plenty to be nervous about at the moment. US and Chinese negotiators are meeting to try and resolve the trade dispute between the two sides, but this has not stopped new tariffs coming into effect a few hours ago. The US imposed a new round of tariffs on $16bn worth of imports from China, including motorcycles, locomotives and agricultural equipment. The 25% tax came into effect at 5.00 BST (noon in Beijing). China immediately responded by saying it planned to file a fresh complaint to the World Trade Organisations, and imposing retaliatory taxes on $16bn worth of US goods. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US-China trade spat continues as representatives from both countries engage in low level talks in the US. The tit-for-tat tariffs conflict continues as both sides will impose tariffs on $16bn worth of each other\u2019s goods today. The monetary size is small but the gesture is big, and traders will be eyeing developments. The trade dispute is of course not the only thing to worry US markets. President Trump\u2019s troubles continued after the criminal conviction of two associates, which is causing the one thing markets hate above all - uncertainty. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: There has been a lot of negative news on Trump over the past 36 hours; the job of markets will now be to decide whether Trump can ride the storm, or whether the double blow is likely to damage the Republican Party\u2019s election prospects at the mid terms in November and result in the extension of a criminal investigation, which is already overshadowing Trump\u2019s presidency. The reality is that the market\u2019s reaction so far has been limited and contained, suggesting that traders believe, at least for now, that Trump can move past this. The latest minutes from the Federal Reserve suggested the central bank is still keen on hiking rates, with another rise expected in September despite Trump\u2019s recent attack on the policy. But the Fed did express some concerns about the Chinese trade spat, meaning it was marginally less hawkish than some had expected. Later today come the minutes from the recent meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors looking for further clues about the ending of its bond buying programme and the prospect of any rate rises. Also today there are the preliminary snapshots of the eurozone economy in August, with updates from France, Germany and the bloc as a whole.CMC\u2019s Madden said: The flash manufacturing and services PMI reports from major eurozone countries will be in focus today. At 08.15 (UK time) France will release their numbers, and economists are expecting the manufacturing report to come in at 53.4, a slight improvement on July\u2019s 53.3. The consensus estimate for the services report is 55.1, up from 54.9 last month. Germany will announce their figures at 08.30 (UK time) and traders are expecting a slight cooling in the manufacturing sector from 56.9 in July to 56.5. Economists are expecting the services report to be 54.3, and the July reading was 54.1. As for the overall eurozone performance, economists at UniCredit said: The composite PMI is likely to edge up slightly in August, to 54.5 from 54.3 in the previous month (10:00 CET). We expect both the manufacturing and the services components to contribute to the headline reading. While a pickup in global trade activity during the second half of 2018, as indicated by our own global leading indicator, is likely to bolster sentiment of eurozone export-dependent manufacturers going forward, solid domestic fundamentals stemming from robust consumer spending and record-low unemployment should keep economic activity in the services sector well supported.

The 25% tax came into effect at 5.00 BST (noon in Beijing).</p> <p>China immediately responded by saying it planned to file a fresh complaint to the World Trade Organisations, and imposing retaliatory taxes on $16bn worth of US goods. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US-China trade spat continues as representatives from both countries engage in low level talks in the US. The tit-for-tat tariffs conflict continues as both sides will impose tariffs on $16bn worth of each other\u2019s goods today. The monetary size is small but the gesture is big, and traders will be eyeing developments.</p> </blockquote> <p>The trade dispute is of course not the only thing to worry US markets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/22/michael-cohen-has-information-on-conspiracy-by-russians-says-lawyer\">President Trump\u2019s troubles continued after the criminal conviction of two associates,</a> which is causing the one thing markets hate above all - uncertainty. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a lot of negative news on Trump over the past 36 hours; the job of markets will now be to decide whether Trump can ride the storm, or whether the double blow is likely to damage the Republican Party\u2019s election prospects at the mid terms in November and result in the extension of a criminal investigation, which is already overshadowing Trump\u2019s presidency. The reality is that the market\u2019s reaction so far has been limited and contained, suggesting that traders believe, at least for now, that Trump can move past this.</p> </blockquote> <p>The latest minutes from the Federal Reserve suggested the central bank is still keen on hiking rates, with another rise expected in September despite Trump\u2019s recent attack on the policy. But the Fed did express some concerns about the Chinese trade spat, meaning it was marginally less hawkish than some had expected.</p> <p>Later today come the minutes from the recent meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors looking for further clues about the ending of its bond buying programme and the prospect of any rate rises.</p> <p>Also today there are the preliminary snapshots of the eurozone economy in August, with updates from France, Germany and the bloc as a whole.CMC\u2019s Madden said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The flash manufacturing and services PMI reports from major eurozone countries will be in focus today. At 08.15 (UK time) France will release their numbers, and economists are expecting the manufacturing report to come in at 53.4, a slight improvement on July\u2019s 53.3. The consensus estimate for the services report is 55.1, up from 54.9 last month. Germany will announce their figures at 08.30 (UK time) and traders are expecting a slight cooling in the manufacturing sector from 56.9 in July to 56.5. Economists are expecting the services report to be 54.3, and the July reading was 54.1. </p> </blockquote> <p>As for the overall eurozone performance, economists at UniCredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The composite PMI is likely to edge up slightly in August, to 54.5 from 54.3 in the previous month (10:00 CET). We expect both the manufacturing and the services components to contribute to the headline reading. While a pickup in global trade activity during the second half of 2018, as indicated by our own global leading indicator, is likely to bolster sentiment of eurozone export-dependent manufacturers going forward, solid domestic fundamentals stemming from robust consumer spending and record-low unemployment should keep economic activity in the services sector well supported.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>8.15 BST French manufacturing and services PMI</p> <p>8.30 BST German manufacturing and services PMI</p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone manufacturing and services PMI</p> <p>11.00 BST CBI distributive trends survey for August</p> <p>12.30 BST Minutes of the July meeting of the European Central Bank <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-23T09:59:00.113Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia insisted it was pressing ahead with a $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) float of the state oil giant, Aramco, following reports that it had shelved plans for the biggest-ever stock market flotation. Reuters first reported on Wednesday that financial advisers working on the plans to sell a 5% stake in Aramco had been disbanded as Saudi Arabia instead focused on a proposed acquisition of a stake in a local petrochemicals maker. However, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said the government would go ahead with the flotation, although he gave no indication of the timeframe. \u201cThe government remains committed to the IPO [initial public offering] of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,\u201d said Khalid al-Falih, who is also chairman of Saudi Aramco. He added: \u201cThis timing will depend on multiple factors, including favourable market conditions, and a downstream acquisition, which the company will pursue in the next few months, as directed by its board of directors.\u201d An unnamed Saudi source familiar with the IPO plans had earlier told Reuters that the flotation would be cancelled. \u201cThe decision to call off the IPO was taken some time ago but no one can disclose this, so statements are gradually going that way \u2013 first delay, then calling off,\u201d the source said. London is among several major financial centres hoping to host the potential Aramco flotation, including New York and Hong Kong. The City regulator changed its listing rules earlier this year in a controversial move that was widely seen as a bid to boost London\u2019s chances of attracting the float. Doubts have been cast over the potential valuation of the company. When Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first announced in 2016 plans to sell 5% of Aramco through a dual listing on the Saudi stock market and an international exchange, Saudi officials predicted the sale could value the whole company at about $2tn (\u00a31.5tn). However, some industry experts have questioned whether such a high valuation is realistic and it is thought a lack of agreement on a valuation has made it difficult for advisers working on the IPO plans. It is not the first time Saudi Arabia has dismissed reports that it is considering shelving plans for the Aramco floatation. In October 2017, the company said the IPO was still on track for 2018, responding to concerns about the feasibility of such a huge international listing. In May this year, Al-Falih said \u201cmost likely it will be in 2019\u201d. In his latest statement on Thursday, the energy minister gave no details on the timing of the long-anticipated IPO but said the government and the company had taken a number of steps to prepare for the listing. \u201cThis is all positive progress on what is a complex process, preparing the company and the kingdom for what will ultimately be a global landmark market offering of unprecedented quality and scale,\u201d he said. The IPO of Saudi Aramco is considered a crucial part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic transformation plan \u2013 Vision 2030 \u2013 involving a lesser dependency on oil.",

The City regulator changed its listing rules earlier this year in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/fca-rule-change-to-lure-saudi-aramco-prompts-criticism\">a controversial move</a> that was widely seen as a bid to boost London\u2019s chances of attracting the float.</p> <p>Doubts have been cast over the potential valuation of the company. When Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first announced in 2016 plans to sell 5% of Aramco through a dual listing on the Saudi stock market and an international exchange, Saudi officials predicted the sale could value the whole company at about $2tn (\u00a31.5tn). </p> <p>However, some industry experts have questioned whether such a high valuation is realistic and it is thought a lack of agreement on a valuation has made it difficult for advisers working on the IPO plans.</p> <p>It is not the first time Saudi Arabia has dismissed reports that it is considering shelving plans for the Aramco floatation. In October 2017, the company said the IPO was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/saudi-aramco-denies-it-is-planning-to-shelve-2-trillion-listing\">still on track for 2018</a>, responding to concerns about the feasibility of such a huge international listing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/25/flotation-of-saudi-oil-giant-aramco-likely-to-be-delayed-until-2019\">Al-Falih said</a> \u201cmost likely it will be in 2019\u201d.</p> <p>In his latest statement on Thursday, the energy minister gave no details on the timing of the long-anticipated IPO but said the government and the company had taken a number of steps to prepare for the listing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all positive progress on what is a complex process, preparing the company and the kingdom for what will ultimately be a global landmark market offering of unprecedented quality and scale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The IPO of Saudi Aramco is considered a crucial part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic transformation plan \u2013 <a href=\"http://vision2030.gov.sa/\">Vision 2030</a> \u2013 involving a lesser dependency on oil.</p>",
