    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The euro fell sharply on the foreign exchanges today after the legendary speculator George Soros said that growing economic and political tensions could destroy the European Union. A hard-hitting attack by the billionaire financier on the ineptitude of European policymakers was backed by warnings from other economists on the first day of the World Economic Forum in Davos about the fragility of the single currency. \"Unfortunately, the European authorities had little understanding of how financial markets really work, and did everything wrong.\" Greece, Soros added, was on the edge of a default that could push it out of the euro. \"The odds are in that direction.\" Following his remarks, the euro lost a cent against the dollar, falling below $1.30. Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists to predict the global financial crisis, said: \"The policy response is making the recession worse. What Europe needs is less austerity and more growth.\" Ken Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, added to the pressure when he said the euro was a \"halfway house that doesn't work\". Soros proposed that Spain and Italy should be allowed to finance their deficits by issuing treasury bills with a 1% interest rate, and warned that the current policies were leaving the weaker eurozone nations \"relegated to the status of third world countries that became highly indebted in a foreign currency. \"The trouble is that the austerity that Germany wants to impose will push Europe into a deflationary debt spiral.\" He added: \"The fact that an unattainable target is being imposed creates a very dangerous political dynamic. Instead of bringing the member countries closer together, it will drive them to mutual recriminations. There is a real danger that the euro will undermine the political cohesion of the European economy.\" Soros said the architects of the single currency had always known it was incomplete, and intended to buttress monetary union with political union. Defects had been ignored, he added, which set in motion a process of disintegration that made union more difficult to achieve today than when the euro was introduced. \"The Greek crisis revealed two defects in the Maastricht treaty [that established the single currency] which could prove fatal. First, that when member countries become heavily indebted they become like third-world countries that have borrowed too much in a foreign currency. Second, that there are no provisions for correcting errors in the euro's design. There is neither an enforcement mechanism nor an exit mechanism, and member countries cannot resort to printing money.\" What was needed, Soros said, was a comprehensive solution backed by ample financial resources. \"But Germany did not want to become the deep pocket for bad debtors. Consequently, Europe did too little too late, and the crisis snowballed.\" Italy and Spain had been hit by contagion, Europe was in the grip of a credit crunch, and there was a risk of economic deterioration and political and social disintegration feeding on each other. The European Union, he said, was \"undemocratic to the point where the electorate is disaffected, and ungovernable to the point where it cannot deal with the crisis that it has created\". His point about the governments of Europe was echoed by Philip Jennings, head of UNI, the Swiss-based international trade union federation, who was concerned about workers being stripped of rights they were accustomed to. \"Technocrat governments are playing with political gunpowder,\" Jennings told the forum. \"The eurozone is going too far.\" Salil Shetty, London-based secretary general of Amnesty International, also warned of the possibility of \"explosions\" among groups of people disillusioned with their falling living standards. Jennings stressed his concern extended beyond the eurozone. In the US, for instance, just 6% of w orkers are covered by collective bargaining. \"If you take away a worker's voice from the table, don't be surprised by the consequences,\" he said. As the first day of Davos got under way yesterday Portugal's borrowing costs were on the rise, hitting a record high amid market fears that the bailed-out country will not be able to break free of its financial crisis in the near future. The yield on three-year debt reached 19.4%, on 10-year bonds it was 14.6%. The economy is forecast to contract by 3.1% this year.",

    "webTitle": "Blame game begins as Britain edges closer to another recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain moved closer to its second recession in three years after official figures showed the UK economy contracted by more than expected in the last three months of 2011. A severe drop in manufacturing and construction output in the runup to Christmas dented hopes the UK could avoid joining much of Europe in a slump expected to push up unemployment and see thousands of companies go bankrupt. David Cameron said there was \"not an ounce of complacency\" as the government sought to get Britain back on track, but he admitted the 0.2% decline in output was disappointing and would make the job harder over the coming months. He told MPs at prime minister's questions that most of the blame should be pinned on the \"overhang of debt and deficit\" from Labour, an unexpected rise in inflation and the crisis in the eurozone. In advance of his appearance on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Cameron urged world leaders to stop tinkering and drifting, and take bold action to boost competitiveness and increase world trade. He warned Europe it could not go on promoting \"unnecessary measures that impose burdens on businesses and governments, that can destroy jobs\". He said: \"Europe's lack of competitiveness remains its achilles heel. For all the talk, the Lisbon strategy has failed to deliver the structural reforms we need.\" George Osborne said the government would not change its fiscal plans, adding that Britain's economic problems were being made worse by the situation in the eurozone. \"I think we've got the right plan, we've got to stick to it,\" he said. He conceded the recovery would be bumpy and include periods of negative growth. But he is expected to come under intense pressure in parliament ahead of his budget in March to explain how he intends to foster confidence in the business community and kickstart growth. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, blamed Osborne for putting the economy into reverse. He said: \"Far from the eurozone crisis being to blame, it is only rising exports that kept us out of recession last year. By clobbering the economy with spending cuts and tax rises that go too far and too fast, the government has left us badly exposed if the eurozone crisis deepens this year.\" The TUC s leader Brendan Barber added: \"The grand austerity plan is failing to tackle the deficit, causing unemployment to spiral out of control, and is dragging the country back towards recession.\" The Treasury has faced a barrage of criticism from opposition MPs and business leaders that it has failed to put forward a growth strategy to support businesses and keep the economy from falling back into recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the government needed to act to spur lending to small and medium-sized businesses. \"Our economy won't grow while our biggest bank, RBS, won't lend. Starving sound small businesses of vital working capital is a recipe for recession,\" he said. A spate of shop closures after Christmas and a collapse in consumer confidence is expected to propel unemployment to new heights in the spring. Capital Economics, a leading firm of economic analysts, said it was likely the UK was already in recession. The prospect of a recession into the spring reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will inject more stimulus into the economy next month. The governor, Mervyn King, who has warned of an arduous recovery ahead, hinted the Bank may extend its programme of quantitative easing that has already pumped \u00a3275bn into the financial system. Figures from the British Bankers Association underscored the government's difficulties after revealing revealed a further contraction in bank lending to the manufacturing and construction sectors. The 0.2% fall in gross domestic product during the final quarter of 2011 came after the economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of 2011. The result, which was worse than economists' forecasts for a 0.1% contraction, means the economy has flatlined since the autumn of 2010. The industrial sector suffered a especially tough quarter, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that factory output dropped by 0.9%. Activity in the construction industry fell, by 0.5%, while the dominant services sector was flat. The ONS figures also showed a bigger fall than expected by the Bank of England and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which assesses whether the government's fiscal plans are sustainable. Economists are generally split as to whether the economy will continue to contract in early 2012, but all stress that any decline will be modest compared to the record 7.1% fall in output in the last recession in 2008-9. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: \"The economy seems close to stall speed, although during any fragile recovery from a major financial crisis, this is not a huge surprise.\" For 2011 as a whole, GDP expanded by 0.9%, less than half the pace in 2010. Compared with the previous year, fourth-quarter output was 0.8% higher, flattered by a sharp fall in output in the year-ago quarter due to heavy snow. Output in the services sector, which accounts for three quarters of GDP, was flat on the quarter, its weakest outturn since the final quarter of 2010. The effect of a 0.4% rise in government and other services was cancelled out by a 0.5% decline in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, which includes retail. The downturn in the UK follows a 0.25% decline in German GDP and the prospect of falls in France and Italy over the winter months. Spain has already entered recession and several other EU nations are expected to follow suit. A slowdown in continental economies and the continued deleveraging by businesses and households as they pay back their debts is expected to intensify efforts to protect spiralling debts in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain from damaging the eurozone recovery.",

With signs that this year's presidential elections in the United States and France will be coloured by increasingly isolationist and protectionist language, Mandelson said the economic crisis of the past four years could easily spill over into a strong anti-globalisation movement, which he said would have baleful consequences. He said: \"If we start closing markets or blocking trade, the prospects are that we would be pushed further into the downward economic spiral that we are in already.\" Even stronger warnings came from a Davos old-stager, the investor George Soros, who stressed the self-defeating nature of the austerity being pushed on Europe by Angela Merkel, predicting that the inevitable result would be a Greek default, contagion, a vortex of economic failure and social unrest and eventually a threat to the European Union itself. When she gave the opening address a couple of hours later, the German chancellor was nothing like as quotable \u2013 or as interesting. Her low-key speech stressed the need for budgetary discipline, competitiveness and solidarity. Bit by bit, Europe was getting there, Merkel said, even though the progress was perhaps not fast enough. Her goal appears to be a United States of Europe, with the European commission acting even more like a government than it does now. David Cameron, who gives a keynote address on Thursday, may have a few problems with that. Europe spent much of the last 12 months in denial about the extent of its problems. The same could be said of Davos, where a poll of chief executives a year ago predicted that 2011 would be a golden year. Instead, it was a stinker, at least for countries in the developed world. Will 2012 be any different? On the evidence so far, fat chance.",

      "bodyText": "The government's tactics over Stephen Hester's bonus are miserable. We've had leaks: it is said David Cameron would tolerate \u00a31m, but no more, for the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland. We've heard excuses that are plainly nonsense: the government's hands are not tied by contracts signed by the last government since annual bonuses are always at the board's discretion. And we've been distracted: it is surely not a coincidence that a row about stripping Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood has exploded just as bonus season arrives. Enough of these games. The government is not allowing UK Financial Investments, the body that it is laughably described as operating at arm's length from the Treasury, a free hand to lobby RBS on bonuses. So it should heed its own call for engaged shareholders to speak their minds. Here's what it should do: First, ask the rest of the RBS board to show some solidarity by cutting their own salaries. The focus on Hester is not helpful. If the government is serious about reining in excessive boardroom pay, reform at the 83% state-owned bank should go wider than Hester. Sir Philip Hampton, RBS chairman, is paid an annual salary of \u00a3750,000. That might have been the going rate for big-bank chairmen in 2009, but times change. If Hampton doesn't feel able to rub by on, say, \u00a3600,000, perhaps it's time to find a chairman who does. After all, Hampton could soon be collecting about \u00a31m from the flowering of a 2009 scheme, which is not a bad return for an equity-based award given the soggy state of RBS's share price. And \u00a3150,000 apiece for senior non-executives, such as Sir Sandy Crombie? In today's climate, that looks more than generous for a part-time role. Trimming salaries across the board would make it easier for the government to make a second request of Penny Hughes, the bank pay committee's \u00a3130,000-a-year chair: if Hester wishes to be considered for a bonus, give him a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The RBS chief's negotiating position, as it were, is not as powerful as it might seem. He is paid a basic salary of \u00a31.2m a year. That's a handsome sum and he might struggle to find another employer willing to match it if he were to quit the bank on bad terms with the government. In that circumstance, most FTSE-100 companies would regard him as a dangerous appointment. On the other hand, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that Hester is doing a tricky job pretty well. The de-risking of the bank, shedding assets such as aeroplane leases and pubs, is on track. Success on that front was one of the central elements of an incentive scheme that offered Hester a theoretical annual bonus jackpot of \u00a32.4m. Yes, the share price has halved over the past year but there have been headwinds outside Edinburgh \u2013 there's a crisis in euroland and the government's decision to adopt the Vickers proposals on ringfencing retail banking directly affected RBS. What's a reasonable compromise? Purists would give Hester no bonus, on the grounds that RBS's profits are still too thin. That's not going to happen. But \u00a3500,000 \u2013 half the sum suggested in the leaks and a quarter of last year's award \u2013 would make it hard for Hester to sulk, especially if his boardroom colleagues had led the way in accepting less than they had expected.",

After news on Wednesday that the UK's GDP fell 0.2% in the final three months of 2011, we are halfway there.</p> <p>With the economy now flatlining for more than a year, as Ed Balls never fails to remind the chancellor, a 0.2% decline may not feel like a sudden lurch downwards for families and businesses that have got used to scrimping and saving.

Meanwhile, \"rising prices for essential services, such as transport and housing, had reduced the amount left over for spending on leisure activities\".</p> <p>In the housing market, \"first-time buyers typically still struggled to raise the deposit required to secure a mortgage\". And as for jobs, \"employment intentions in the private sector continued to weaken, and suggested that employment was unlikely to grow over the next six months\". In other words, it is bleak out there, and it is going to get worse.</p> <p>As Danny Blanchflower, the former monetary policy committee member who has long been pessimistic about the outlook for the UK, says: \"This is not just data, it's people's lives: real wages are falling, unemployment is rising \u2014 at some point people are going to start feeling that.\"</p> <p>Treasury officials sought to brush off the GDP figures, pointing out that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had pencilled in at least one negative quarter. Last winter's 0.5% decline, as snow kept much of the workforce at home, was almost wiped out by 0.4% growth in the following three months.</p> <p>But given that the OBR made its forecasts two months ago, deep into the fourth quarter of 2011, the period to which these figures refer, it is hardly surprising they were not too far off the mark. It is more instructive to compare the numbers to what the OBR was predicting at the budget last March.</p> <p>In its spring forecast the OBR was expecting GDP growth of 1.7% for 2011; in the event, the economy eked out an expansion of just 0.9%, as consumers hit hard by tax increases and rampant inflation tightened their belts, and manufacturers were hammered by the crisis in their largest market, continental Europe.</p> <p>It is even more revealing to look at how far the economy remains from its pre-credit crisis peak. Output is languishing almost 4% below its level in spring 2008, before the first tremors of the worldwide economic catastrophe were felt. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research regularly points out, the period in which GDP is stuck below its pre-crisis level is a depression \u2014 and yesterday's figures confirmed that this is now <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">longer than the Great Depression</a>.</p> <p>There is also precious little evidence so far of progress towards the much-needed \"rebalancing\" that policymakers have been hoping for since the crisis struck, to help the UK pay its way in the world, instead of relying on cheap debt to keep the economy growing.</p> <p>Manufacturing output declined by 0.9% in the fourth quarter, and industrial output overall \u2013 which is dragged down by plunging production from the North Sea \u2013 was 2.6% lower than a year earlier.</p> <p>Manufacturers themselves remain pretty sanguine; but the evidence from the Bank's agents suggested any success they are having in expanding into new markets such as China and India is being offset by the catastrophic weakness of demand from the home market.</p> <p>At the same time, Tuesday's public finance figures, which showed a sharp narrowing in the monthly deficit, revealed that Osborne's deficit-cutting strategy is now starting to bite hard. As Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, puts it: \"The government has entered into a ferocious squeeze on public spending, which in the short run will only add to the risks of a recession.\"</p> <p>The only small crumb of comfort for Osborne is that when he delivers his budget in March it will be too soon to know the GDP figures for the first quarter of 2012 \u2014 so although we may already be in recession by then, we won't know it.</p>",

As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research regularly points out, the period in which GDP is stuck below its pre-crisis level is a depression \u2014 and yesterday's figures confirmed that this is now longer than the Great Depression. There is also precious little evidence so far of progress towards the much-needed \"rebalancing\" that policymakers have been hoping for since the crisis struck, to help the UK pay its way in the world, instead of relying on cheap debt to keep the economy growing. Manufacturing output declined by 0.9% in the fourth quarter, and industrial output overall \u2013 which is dragged down by plunging production from the North Sea \u2013 was 2.6% lower than a year earlier. Manufacturers themselves remain pretty sanguine; but the evidence from the Bank's agents suggested any success they are having in expanding into new markets such as China and India is being offset by the catastrophic weakness of demand from the home market. At the same time, Tuesday's public finance figures, which showed a sharp narrowing in the monthly deficit, revealed that Osborne's deficit-cutting strategy is now starting to bite hard. As Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, puts it: \"The government has entered into a ferocious squeeze on public spending, which in the short run will only add to the risks of a recession.\" The only small crumb of comfort for Osborne is that when he delivers his budget in March it will be too soon to know the GDP figures for the first quarter of 2012 \u2014 so although we may already be in recession by then, we won't know it.",

But April looks contrastingly sparse. \"I'm inevitably part of the bad news on GDP,\" he says, \"not only through contraction in my own business, as a seller, but as a buyer, through travelling less, buying less fuel and cutting back on spending all round. We've got to hunker down. Luckily the business is small and flexible and capable of doing that, so I'm confident that we'll get through.\" \"These things are cyclical, and better times will come if we can hang on,\" he says running through details of his first-ever consultancy on the Isle of Wight, which he last saw as a child with a bucket and spade. \"But I sometimes feel that my generation is blessed.\" Now 57, he walked into a motor mechanic apprenticeship at 16, then a potentially lifetime job with Jaguar before changing to voluntary sector administration. \"It isn't looking like that for our young ones,\" he says. \"I had a career at their age; they've got jobs. I had a mortgage; they rent and can't imagine raising the sort of money you need for a deposit. The government talks about a private sector recovery sorting it all out, but I'm afraid that's a flight of fancy.\"",

This decline in Q1 is also far from assured, although anything much better than broadly flat seems unattainable. Growth during Q4 was highly volatile, with broad-based negativity in October being followed by a respectable recovery later in the quarter.

There are two important aspects to the news in Q4 GDP.

Second, survey indicators suggest that the latest spell of weakness in the economy has troughed and we should expect growth to slowly improve from here. In fact the PMI surveys showed activity bottomed in October and has gradually improved since. Furthermore, this week we saw some encouraging signs from the euro area, with flash PMIs showing activity stabilised in January in both the manufacturing and services sectors.</p> <p>While a technical recession cannot be ruled out, the signs are that the economy is turning the corner slowly and there is little evidence to support predictions of a deep recession.

And in the process, in ways that are possible only in a project of this kind, new avenues of investigation and technical development have opened up for exploration. \"The multinational European character of EADS is an advantage and an opportunity, one of its great strengths,\" says a proud Juan Silva, the engineer in charge of the final assembly line, who highlights the fact that in some phases more foreign than Spanish workers are involved in the process. So convinced is he of the benefits of the exchange of ideas that he tries to make sure as many workers as possible spend time working in other European countries, so they can compare processes. This was how they developed a sophisticated compressed-air system that allows an assembly-line robot to move weights of 38 tonnes almost with one hand. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez, in charge of Station 20, where the engines are installed, sets out the advantages of what he calls the Airbus philosophy, which is based on the constant exchange of information and experiences throughout the team, from operatives to bosses, and on cultivating personal relationships. Dulce Mu\u00f1oz, who works on his section, highlights the \"enriching\" nature of learning to look at things in new ways. \"It helps to break down myths,\" says her colleague, Ernesto Faluarte. \"We've got the same problems they have in France or Germany, and we're just as good as they are.\" The joint effort being made, and the existence of five prototypes already with 2,800 hours of flight time, has eliminated some prejudices and reinforced others. The conviction lives on that the Germans are \"the masters of method\", thanks to their mathematical accomplishments in the field of process. But it is also recognised that the Spanish have shown a very high level of technological ability \u2013 something question marks hung over at the start of the project. The relationships between the different units of EADS in Europe is now so firmly established that they are able to monitor, in real time, from the centre of flight operations in Seville, more than 40,000 variables affecting a plane as it flies over the Pyrenees, and exchange more than 200,000 pieces of time-related data. \"One team, different streams,\" Francisco Jim\u00e9nez says, as he monitors from his desk in Seville the hydraulic system of a plane flying over France.

      "bodyText": "Britain has moved closer to its second recession in three years after official figures showed the UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the last three months of 2011. A severe drop in manufacturing output in the last quarter dented hopes that the UK could avoid joining much of Europe in a slump that is expected to push up unemployment and see thousands of companies go bankrupt. Capital Economics, a leading firm of economic analysts, said it was likely the UK was already in recession. Britain's industrial sector suffered a tough quarter, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that factory output dropped by 0.9%. Activity in the construction industry also fell, by 0.5%, while the UK's dominant services sector was flat. The figures are likely to reinforce expectations the Bank of England will inject more stimulus into the economy next month after governor Mervyn King warned of an arduous recovery ahead. George Osborne said the government would not change its fiscal plans, adding that the fall in GDP was partly caused by the eurozone debt crisis. \"I think we've got the right plan, we've got to stick to it, but we've got to accept that Britain's economic problems \u2013 difficult as they are, build up as they have been over the last 10 years \u2013 have been made worse by the situation in the eurozone and by the crisis on our doorstep,\" the chancellor said. Ed Balls, though, insisted Osborne should be blamed for putting the economy into reverse. \"Far from the eurozone crisis being to blame, it is only rising exports that kept us out of recession last year. By clobbering the economy with spending cuts and tax rises that go too far and too fast, the government has left us badly exposed if the eurozone crisis deepens this year,\" Balls said. The Treasury has faced a barrage of criticism from opposition MPs that it has failed to put forward a growth strategy to support businesses and keep the economy from falling back into recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the upper house, said the government needed to act to spur lending to small and medium-sized businesses. He said without a plan to reverse the decline in lending the economy would continue to suffer. \"Our economy won't grow while our biggest bank, RBS, won't lend. Starving sound small businesses of vital working capital is a recipe for recession,\" he said. Osborne conceded the recovery would be bumpy and would include periods of negative growth. But he is expected to come under intense pressure in parliament this week to explain how he intends to foster confidence in the business community and kickstart growth. A spate of shop closures after Christmas and a collapse in consumer confidence over the winter months is expected to propel unemployment to new heights in the spring. A stalling economy The 0.2% fall in gross domestic product during came after the economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of 2011 \u2013 worse than economists' forecasts for a 0.1% contraction. The decline is also slightly bigger than that expected by the Bank and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which assesses whether the government's fiscal plans are sustainable. Economists are generally split as to whether Britain's economy will continue to contract in early 2012, but all stress that any decline will be modest compared to the record 7.1% fall in output in Britain's last recession in 2008-09. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: \"The UK economy seems close to stall speed, although during any fragile recovery from a major financial crisis, this is not a huge surprise.\" For 2011 as a whole, GDP expanded by 0.9%, less than half the pace recorded in 2010. On the year, fourth-quarter output was 0.8% higher, flattered by a sharp fall in output in the year-ago quarter due to heavy snow. The fourth-quarter contraction in output follows a 0.25% decline in German GDP. Spain has already entered recession, according to the country's finance minister and several other EU nations are expected to follow suit. A slowdown in continental economies and the continued de-leveraging by businesses and households as they pay back their debts will increase the chance that the Bank of England will approve a further \u00a350bn of quantitative easing in February, once the current \u00a375bn of purchases started in October are complete. King said on Tuesday that the central bank had scope to give the economy another cash boost if needed as inflation is falling and Britain faces an \"arduous, long and uneven\" economic recovery. Wednesday's data showed that manufacturing, electricity and gas, and distribution, hotels and restaurants were the main contributors to the fall in output, each subtracting 0.1% from GDP. Manufacturing output fell 0.9% on the quarter, its biggest drop since the third quarter of 2009. Utilities output was down 4.1%, its biggest fall since the start of 2011 as mild weather reduced demand. Output in the services sector, which accounts for three quarters of GDP, was flat on the quarter, its weakest outturn since the final quarter of 2010.

      "body": "<p>\"I wish I could say it's bad, but frankly it's worse than that: it's dire and has been for some time,\" says Eddie Talbot, owner of the JET model shop in Caerphilly. \"I've been going for 20 years and it's never been this bad. I don't know where it's going to end and I don't think the government is doing enough to help.\"</p> <p>Talbot's neighbours tell the same sad story. They are being hit with, as they see it, astronomical business rates and plunging consumer confidence. Some are planning to leave the south Wales town, famed for its stunning castle, the cheese and as the birthplace of comedian Tommy Cooper. Others say they are just waiting for the end to come.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=2225\" title=\"\">report</a> published on Wednesday by the <a href=\"http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=228\" title=\"\">Welsh assembly's enterprise committee</a>, and being launched in Caerphilly, concludes that throughout the country high streets are struggling to survive.</p> <p>It calls on the Welsh government to do more to boost town centres by reforming planning laws, helping independent traders take on out-of-town malls and finding a way to reduce business rates. It says more flexible opening times should be encouraged so that shoppers stay in town centres into the evening and suggests converting empty shops into homes.</p> <p>Town centres throughout the UK are suffering but the report, which follows hard on the heels of the collapse of the Welsh high street giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/20/peacocks-collapse-rocks- retail-industry\" title=\"\">Peacocks into administration</a>, concludes that the problems are particularly acute in Wales.</p> <p>According to the report, <a href=\"http://www.senedd.assemblywales.org/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=1522\" title=\"\">produced after a wide-ranging inquiry</a>, the proportion of vacant premises in Wales stands at 11.5%, above the UK average of 11.1%. The report says the decline is partly due to the economic downturn but also because of \"long-term structural issues\".</p> <p>Among these are \"weaknesses in planning law\" \u2013 the inquiry heard planners had little option but to give permission to out-of-town stores and centres. Councils said they could not afford to challenge supermarkets wanting to build new stores away from centres because of \"punitive legal costs\".</p> <p>The report also says office space has moved to out-of-town locations, taking with it workers who used to shop and dine in town centres.</p> <p>Nick Ramsay, the committee chair, said vibrant town centres were crucial to the wellbeing of Wales but the inquiry had found deep problems. \"Our inquiry showed that throughout Wales there are examples of weak and vulnerable high streets, blighted by empty premises and poor shopping environments.</p> <p>\"Key to tackling these issues is strong, effective leadership at ministerial level, which must then be complemented locally in towns and communities across Wales,\" said Ramsay, a Conservative assembly member.</p> <p>The inquiry found that many shop owners complained they were struggling with soaring business rates. Shopkeepers in one small market town the committee visited said rates had risen by more than 200% in recent years. The report suggests that an independent panel should consider changes in legislation to help struggling store owners.</p> <p>Around the corner from the JET model shop, at Whaddon's jeweller's and gift shop, sisters Jan, Ann and Lynda Whaddon say they suspect the local authority does not care about this part of the town. In recent years money has been invested down the hill in a new shopping centre, Castle Court, opposite the castle. The national chains have set up shop there but the top of the town feels neglected.</p> <p>\"Nobody comes up here any more,\" says Lynda Whaddon. \"The rates are huge \u2013 more expensive than parts of Cardiff \u2013 and in return we get no help. The council and the government needs to do more.\"</p> <p>The Whaddons have a string of shops they would like to rent out, but they remain empty for the moment. \"We still have to pay full rates for them. We're losing \u00a320,000 a year on empty shops,\" says Lynda.</p> <p>Terry Burton, the landlord of the Irish Tymes pub, complains that just before Christmas the whole street was dug up. \"It was like the Marie Celeste up here,\" he says. \"Some shopkeepers saw their trade cut by 95%. They don't spend money on this part of town.

      "bodyText": "\"I wish I could say it's bad, but frankly it's worse than that: it's dire and has been for some time,\" says Eddie Talbot, owner of the JET model shop in Caerphilly. \"I've been going for 20 years and it's never been this bad. I don't know where it's going to end and I don't think the government is doing enough to help.\" Talbot's neighbours tell the same sad story. They are being hit with, as they see it, astronomical business rates and plunging consumer confidence. Some are planning to leave the south Wales town, famed for its stunning castle, the cheese and as the birthplace of comedian Tommy Cooper. Others say they are just waiting for the end to come. A report published on Wednesday by the Welsh assembly's enterprise committee, and being launched in Caerphilly, concludes that throughout the country high streets are struggling to survive. It calls on the Welsh government to do more to boost town centres by reforming planning laws, helping independent traders take on out-of-town malls and finding a way to reduce business rates. It says more flexible opening times should be encouraged so that shoppers stay in town centres into the evening and suggests converting empty shops into homes. Town centres throughout the UK are suffering but the report, which follows hard on the heels of the collapse of the Welsh high street giant Peacocks into administration, concludes that the problems are particularly acute in Wales. According to the report, produced after a wide-ranging inquiry, the proportion of vacant premises in Wales stands at 11.5%, above the UK average of 11.1%. The report says the decline is partly due to the economic downturn but also because of \"long-term structural issues\". Among these are \"weaknesses in planning law\" \u2013 the inquiry heard planners had little option but to give permission to out-of-town stores and centres. Councils said they could not afford to challenge supermarkets wanting to build new stores away from centres because of \"punitive legal costs\". The report also says office space has moved to out-of-town locations, taking with it workers who used to shop and dine in town centres. Nick Ramsay, the committee chair, said vibrant town centres were crucial to the wellbeing of Wales but the inquiry had found deep problems. \"Our inquiry showed that throughout Wales there are examples of weak and vulnerable high streets, blighted by empty premises and poor shopping environments. \"Key to tackling these issues is strong, effective leadership at ministerial level, which must then be complemented locally in towns and communities across Wales,\" said Ramsay, a Conservative assembly member. The inquiry found that many shop owners complained they were struggling with soaring business rates. Shopkeepers in one small market town the committee visited said rates had risen by more than 200% in recent years. The report suggests that an independent panel should consider changes in legislation to help struggling store owners. Around the corner from the JET model shop, at Whaddon's jeweller's and gift shop, sisters Jan, Ann and Lynda Whaddon say they suspect the local authority does not care about this part of the town. In recent years money has been invested down the hill in a new shopping centre, Castle Court, opposite the castle. The national chains have set up shop there but the top of the town feels neglected. \"Nobody comes up here any more,\" says Lynda Whaddon. \"The rates are huge \u2013 more expensive than parts of Cardiff \u2013 and in return we get no help. The council and the government needs to do more.\" The Whaddons have a string of shops they would like to rent out, but they remain empty for the moment. \"We still have to pay full rates for them. We're losing \u00a320,000 a year on empty shops,\" says Lynda. Terry Burton, the landlord of the Irish Tymes pub, complains that just before Christmas the whole street was dug up. \"It was like the Marie Celeste up here,\" he says. \"Some shopkeepers saw their trade cut by 95%. They don't spend money on this part of town. All the council wants is your money but they don't think how they can help you.\" Back at JET Models, Talbot places a plane kit \u2013 a Hawker Typhoon \u2013 back on its shelf.
