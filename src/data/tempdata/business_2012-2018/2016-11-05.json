      "bodyText": "As the Chicago Cubs finally won the baseball World Series, Twitter was awash with comments on things that had happened since 1908 \u2013 the last time the Cubs won. For example, since then there had been two world wars, the beginning and end of the Soviet Union and media had moved from a time when baseball wasn\u2019t even broadcast on radio to when you could watch the game in HD on your phone on the other side of the world. And also, in the time since, the planet has warmed by around 1.5C. I throw in this little nugget of information because it\u2019s always worth reminding ourselves that while the flotsam and jetsam of daily news and politics flies by, so too are the temperature records. Nasa recently announced that September was the warmest September on record. There\u2019s nothing too surprising about that \u2013 11 of the past 12 months have been the warmest of each month. Only July did not set a record \u2013 it had to be content with being the third-warmest July on record. The 12 months to September set a new high for the warmest 12-month period recorded (breaking the old record set in August) of 1.04C above the average of the 1951-1980. The same period in 1908 was 0.42C below the average. So things have changed. Back in 1908 there was also a US presidential election. There were no debates then but, ironically, the same number of questions on climate change were asked in this year\u2019s debates as back then \u2013 zero. We now have the prospect of a US president who either believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, or at best believes it\u2019s just a hoax perpetrated by some vague group because \u201cit\u2019s a money-making industry\u201d. And yet this hardly rates a mention \u2013 lost amid an avalanche of stories about the emails of the other candidate. Now we could get on a high horse, except Australia doesn\u2019t fare much better. Climate change at least was the topic of one question in the leaders\u2019 debate but it hardly dominated the election. And, like the US, we also have multiple politicians who fall at the first hurdle when it comes to intelligence by professing that climate change is a con. Mostly here, the topic comes up as the cause of blame \u2013 such as renewable energy being cited as the cause for the blackout in South Australia or even again this week with the announcement of the Hazelwood power station closing. As such, the discussion revolves around the negative aspect of the cost of policies that will reduce carbon emissions. It\u2019s a framing that has the underlying foundation that not pursing policies to reduce carbon emissions is a credible alternative. It is rather similar to businesses complaining of the cost of introducing domestic violence leave rather than worrying about the horrific fact that there is actually a need for such a type of leave. As Gay Alcorn noted on Friday \u2013 the closure of the Hazelwood power station was inevitable \u2013 and yet the sense is that both state and federal governments were caught flat footed. Unsurprisingly, the first reaction was to focus more on compensation packages for the workers. But there is a lack of any sense of governments accepting this is just the first of such closures and that plans and responses for them should be well in place by now. As the Climate Council noted this week, Australia\u2019s climate change policy is mired in a valley of uncertainty, where our emissions reductions target for 2030 are based on measures that have been yet to be brought into force. We don\u2019t have a gibbering fool like Trump for a leader who screams about China and international hoaxes on climate change but Turnbull has long shed the leather jacket persona of his Q&amp;A days when he took pride in his then principled stand on climate change policy. Now more likely we\u2019ll hear him talk of the great future for coal and rush to blame renewable energy rather than to push it as a solution. No, he\u2019s not the gibbering fool; he is just the appeaser of those fools within his government. And that is no less damaging. It is not a strategy that can last, because while it might help to keep the issue off the political agenda, and keep his leadership somewhat more safe, the months keep passing and the temperature keeps rising. Because of its size, age and dirtiness, Hazelwood carries with it greater significance than do other coal-fired power stations. Perhaps its closure \u2013 regardless of the reasons for it \u2013 will force both federal and state governments to acknowledge that the future is here already.",

      "bodyText": "The decline of traditional US industries has formed the backdrop to Donald Trump\u2019s central pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. It has also energised the support of a former mainstay of the Democrat vote, the white working class. Five key sectors in particular have suffered since their heydays in the previous century. Manufacturing Fewer than one in 10 Americans work in manufacturing, compared to one in four in 1960. While Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) is often blamed for shipping American manufacturing jobs south of the border to Mexico, the number of employees in manufacturing actually increased in the US after it was enacted in 1994. But economists argue that China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has had the biggest impact on American manufacturing jobs by flooding the US with cheap imports that have knocked out homemade goods. Coal mining Coal has had an ill-fated recent history in the US, as momentum has grown around a push for renewable energy. Employment peaked in the 1920s, when almost half a million people worked in the coal mines. But those jobs were shed over the ensuing decades as improvements in technology made mines more efficient. Nevertheless, US coal production had grown continuously up until its peak in 2008. Since then, production has dropped as the government has steadily phased out more coal energy plants in favour of renewable power such as wind and solar. Steel The US industry has collapsed due to competition from cheap overseas steel. Production of American steel peaked in the 1970s, and its decline was accelerated by the 2008 financial crisis. The situation has been made worse by the slowdown of the oil industry \u2013 a heavy user of steel. Automation has been a key driver of job losses, however. Textiles America used to make a lot of its own clothes, but the signing of trade deals and much cheaper labour costs overseas have led to the majority of clothing companies sending production offshore. In the 1960s, approximately 95% of clothing worn in the US was made domestically, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association. Now, 97% of clothing and 98% of shoes sold in the US are made overseas. The trend is set to continue, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks clothing, leather, and allied manufacturing as the most rapidly declining industry in the US. The bureau forecast the industry to decline by -5.9% between 2014 and 2024. Cars America was the world\u2019s leading automotive manufacturer in the early 1900s, when technology created the era of mass production. Annual sales of American cars peaked in 1978 at 12.9m but declined to 7m in 1982, as Japan usurped the US as the world\u2019s leading car producer. Car sales were also hit in the 2000s by a sustained increase in petrol prices. This left General Motors and Chrysler poorly positioned to handle the recession in 2008 and needing an $85bn (\u00a368bn) government bailout. Since 2010, the American automotive industry has rebounded, adding jobs consistently. This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to correct the byline.

      "bodyText": "The US is not the only western nation to be undergoing political ructions over the faltering post-crisis recovery. New counter-establishment parties have emerged in several countries and, as in the UK, people have voted for dramatic change. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a growing sense in developed economies that workers have yet to benefit from the recovery or rising globalisation. Germany Germany\u2019s economy has largely outperformed the wider eurozone in recent years. Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany\u2019s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory. That has exacerbated grievances some Germans have long held over the euro, a union they feel benefits poorer countries more than their own. Animosity towards the single currency was behind the founding of the populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in 2013. The party has since shifted to the right and enjoyed gains in regional elections by playing on fears over immigration and chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s policy on refugees. UK After a prolonged squeeze on household incomes in the wake of the financial crisis and spending cuts, June\u2019s Brexit vote was widely seen as being as much about frustration with the establishment as a decision to leave the EU. Ministers have repeatedly hailed Britain\u2019s rising employment and relatively strong economic growth, but a quick look behind the headline figures explains why such boasts have been met with disbelief by many. Employment is up, but a significant driver of this gain has been self-employment and other forms of insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, and employers have continued to rely on low-paid labour rather than investing to grow. A recent study by the Trades Union Congress,the umbrella body for British unions, found Britain suffered a bigger fall in real wages since the financial crisis than any other advanced country apart from Greece. France Years on from the financial crisis, many French people feel they are not sharing in the recovery. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has come under fire for his handling of the economy and is France\u2019s least popular president on record. Unemployment remains above 10%, one of the highest rates in the EU. Youth unemployment is higher still, at 24%. The rebound in economic growth has been lacklustre. Many feel that globalisation is bringing more costs than benefits for France. Anti-globalisation and anti-euro sentiments have combined with fears over terrorism and immigration to drive up support for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right Front National. Le Pen is seen as likely to reach the run-off in next year\u2019s presidential elections but, like her father in 2002, is expected to be defeated. Italy Economic growth has been consistently disappointing in Italy and a succession of coalition governments has failed to push through reforms to help adapt the economy to a changing world. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that the economy may not fully recover until the mid-2020s. Scope for Matteo Renzi\u2019s centre-left government to use tax cuts or increases in public spending to boost growth has been limited by low productivity, high unemployment and rising national debt. The country goes to the polls next month in a referendum on changes to its constitution that Renzi and his allies argue will make the country easier to govern and reform. Similar to the Brexit vote in the UK, the referendum is being seen as a way for Italians to voice their general discontent with the establishment and the sluggish economy. A defeat for the prime minister could pave the way to a national election, with gains expected for comedian Beppe Grillo\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Another populist force is the rightwing Northern League. It began as a party that argued for a separation of rich northern Italy from the poor south, but its focus has shifted to immigration. Russia Russia\u2019s economy has been ravaged by recession and it is expected to shrink again this year, returning to only modest growth in 2017. The slump, intensified by western sanctions and low oil prices, has pushed Russia\u2019s poverty rate to a nine-year high. The World Bank expects it to rise further, with more than 20 million people, out of a population of some 140 million, living below the poverty line. The blow to energy-dependent Russia from global oil prices almost halving has limited the help it can give any part of the economy. But there is a feeling among many workers that their lives have become bleaker as high inflation erodes household incomes, while companies fared better thanks to state support and a weak rouble. This squeeze on the working classes has not manifested itself in the kind of new populist movements seen in EU countries. Russia expert Charles Movit at consultancy IHS Economics says: \u201cThe media is totally controlled by the state in Russia and the tradition of strong leaders is ingrained. [President Vladimir] Putin himself is very popular, the government less so and the opposition is very weak.\u201d",

New counter-establishment parties have emerged in several countries and, as in the UK, people have voted for dramatic change. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a growing sense in developed economies that workers have yet to benefit from the recovery or rising globalisation.</p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong><br></h2> <p>Germany\u2019s economy has largely outperformed the wider eurozone in recent years. Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany\u2019s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory. That has exacerbated grievances some Germans have long held over the euro, a union they feel benefits poorer countries more than their own.</p> <p>Animosity towards the single currency was behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">founding of the populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in 2013</a>.

Ministers have repeatedly hailed Britain\u2019s rising employment and relatively strong economic growth, but a quick look behind the headline figures explains why such boasts have been met with disbelief by many. Employment is up, but a significant driver of this gain has been self-employment and other forms of insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, and employers have continued to rely on low-paid labour rather than investing to grow.

Another populist force is the rightwing Northern League. It began as a party that argued for a separation of rich northern Italy from the poor south, but its focus has shifted to immigration.</p> <h2>Russia<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df10782903fb50426177e166680736eb00d350f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df10782903fb50426177e166680736eb00d350f5/0_237_3372_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winter Clothes Given Out To Homeless People In Moscow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poverty in Russia is at a nine-year high as low oil prices hit the economy. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russia\u2019s economy has been ravaged by recession and it is expected to shrink again this year, returning to only modest growth in 2017.

      "bodyText": "It may be seven weeks until Christmas but with John Lewis due to launch its latest tear-jerker next week, the unofficial start of the annual festive battle for the hearts and minds \u2013 and, ultimately, wallets \u2013 of the British public is about to commence in earnest. Companies \u2013 led by the big name retailers and supermarkets \u2013 will spend a record \u00a35.6bn this year in a frenzied attempt to outdo each other. But does the lavish brand-building and product-pushing translate into higher festive sales? John Lewis is expected to launch a \u00a37m ad campaign on 10 November, with sources tipping Randy Crawford\u2019s song One Day I\u2019ll Fly Away as the soundtrack. The retailer makes 20% of annual sales and 40% of its profits over the Christmas quarter and capturing the nation\u2019s hearts is absolutely critical. \u201cFailing to engage the nation would have a significant commercial, social and cultural impact on the John Lewis brand,\u201d says its ad agencies in a detailed analysis of its Christmas ads. \u201cWe make just over \u00a38 [profit] for every pound we spend so the Christmas ad campaigns are hugely profitable,\u201d says Craig Inglis, customer director and marketing chief at John Lewis. \u201cThe returns are long term as well; we see the continuing impact. The \u00a37m we spend is dwarfed by our competitors. We punch well above our weight.\u201d John Lewis says its Christmas ad campaigns over the past four years, which have included two star-crossed snowmen, a bear and a hare, Monty the penguin, and an elderly man on the moon, have fuelled an average 16% lift in festive sales. The number of festive shoppers in John Lewis stores has climbed more than 50% from 926,000 to 1.4m between 2013 and 2015. John Lewis\u2019s ads may grab the most headlines but it is not the only major player to have used advertising to turn Christmas into a commercial cracker. From its big budget and controversial ad highlighting the spirit of the Christmas Day truce in the first world war trenches, to last year\u2019s revival of Judith Kerr\u2019s loveable calamitous cat Mog which spawned a best-selling childrens book, Sainsbury\u2019s is the only retailer to have come close to John Lewis in recent years. This year\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s ad, which will launch on 14 November, will showcase another \u201cinteresting creative collaboration\u201d, following tie-ups with the British Legion and Kerr\u2019s Mog. The Mog campaign, which trumped John Lewis\u2019s Monty the Penguin as the most-viewed ad on YouTube UK in 2015, helped the supermarket beat analyst expectations for sales over the Christmas period, although they still fell by 0.4%. Craig Mawdsley, joint chief strategy officer at Sainsbury\u2019s ad agency AMV BBDO, says research has shown that the supermarket managed a profit of \u00a324 for every \u00a31 spent on its Christmas ad campaign in 2014. The figure was even stronger last year. \u201cClassic [advertising] of just products, and big prices and headlines actually generates much lower return on investment than a beautiful 3.5 minute film with a cat in it,\u201d Mawdsley says. \u201cThat\u2019s largely because it has a broader brand effect. Product advertising alone is short term and doesn\u2019t help the long-term perception of the brand.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s spent almost \u00a322m on advertising over Christmas last year, part of its battle to see off discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. Aldi and Lidl spent \u00a323m each on marketing last Christmas, with only Tesco and Asda higher among the supermarket brands in 2015. Lidl used its festive advertising to push the public to reappraise it as a quality brand. Currys/PC World hit the jackpot with a major shift away from its usual product promotion strategy and hiring American actor Jeff Goldblum. Pushing its brand not its products for the first time boosted festive sales by 5%, above analyst expectations. Other success stories include House Of Fraser, which has once again gone for the \u201canti-John Lewis\u201d strategy \u2013 punchy soundtrack and in-your-face dancing. Last year\u2019s attitude-laden \u201cYour Christmas, Your Rules\u201d, which used Justin Bieber\u2019s choreographer, has been followed up with the newly launched \u201cChristmas is Coming to Get You\u201d featuring Ready or Not, famously covered by the Fugees, sung by Laura Mvula. House of Fraser hope its counter-strategy will work again this year \u2013sales over Christmas 2015 rose 5.2% and the store notched up its biggest ever online shopping day. \u201cIt\u2019s tough out there, the Brexit vote revealed a nation not in a good place,\u201d says Jonathan Trimble, chief executive of House of Fraser\u2019s ad agency 18 Feet &amp; Rising. \u201cWe have taken advantage of people being a little angrier out there. John Lewis has done a Richard Curtis [director of Love Actually and Four Weddings and A Funeral] to Christmas ads. That\u2019s not relevant to everyone.\u201d But for every Christmas cracker there are a few turkeys. Last year\u2019s big budget effort by M&amp;S, once a Christmas high-flyer who spends well over \u00a323m a year, was little more than a glitzy product ad using the beyond-saturated Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Its Christmas sales fell 5.8%. So too Morrisons, which last year dumped its traditional celebrity tie-up with Ant \u2019n\u2019 Dec, in favour of a back-to-basics approach featuring its own staff. A flurry of campaigns with totally divergent strategies have already hit the screens, from early runner Burberry\u2019s mini-film featuring Sienna Miller and Domhnall Gleeson, and Harvey Nichol\u2019s tongue-in-cheek \u201cBritalia\u201d campaign celebrating all things Italian, to Argos\u2019s \u00a330,000-a-pop ice skating Yetis. \u201cPeople at Christmas want to be engaged in stories,\u201d says Craig Inglis, who despite John Lewis\u2019s recent success takes nothing for granted this year. \u201cNot everyone can do a John Lewis ad. We have to keep the thread [of ads] and also keep it fresh. No one here is resting on their laurels. We don\u2019t believe the hype.\u201d",

That\u2019s not relevant to everyone.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e36db5d7b696fbf768a7e75f02d0dfee1426dba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e36db5d7b696fbf768a7e75f02d0dfee1426dba/0_9_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry xmas ad\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic West stars in the Christmas Burberry advert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But for every Christmas cracker there are a few turkeys. Last year\u2019s big budget effort by M&amp;S, once a Christmas high-flyer who spends well over \u00a323m a year, was little more than a glitzy product ad using the beyond-saturated Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Its Christmas sales fell 5.8%.<br></p> <p>So too Morrisons, which last year dumped its traditional celebrity tie-up with Ant \u2019n\u2019 Dec, in favour of a back-to-basics approach featuring its own staff.<br></p> <p>A flurry of campaigns with totally divergent strategies have already hit the screens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/sienna-miller-domhnall-gleeson-burberry-christmas-ad-dominic-west-lily-james\">from early runner Burberry\u2019s mini-film featuring Sienna Miller and Domhnall Gleeson</a>, and Harvey Nichol\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NVUVm8qsPdw\">tongue-in-cheek \u201cBritalia\u201d campaign</a> celebrating all things Italian, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RxJQt_1Bq5I\">to Argos\u2019s \u00a330,000-a-pop ice skating Yetis</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople at Christmas want to be engaged in stories,\u201d says Craig Inglis, who despite John Lewis\u2019s recent success takes nothing for granted this year. \u201cNot everyone can do a John Lewis ad. We have to keep the thread [of ads] and also keep it fresh. No one here is resting on their laurels. We don\u2019t believe the hype.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p> </p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><br></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><br></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><br></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> </p> <p><br></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p>",
