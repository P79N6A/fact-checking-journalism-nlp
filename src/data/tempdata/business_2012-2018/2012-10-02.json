    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Legislation that would have ensured that the City traders behind the Libor interest rates scandal did not escape prosecution is to be promised by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on Wednesday. In her conference speech she will pledge that the next Labour government will introduce the first-ever Economic Crime Act in a drive against the \"grey and murky area\" of financial crime, including fraud and money-laundering. The legislation would make it a criminal offence to manipulate interest rates to make money, while victims pay more. The shadow home secretary is also to make clear that Labour police and commissioners elected next month will \"halt the Tory rush to privatisation of our police\" and limit the involvement of private companies in the police service. The decision to frame an economic crime bill is one of a number of areas of the criminal justice system that Cooper is expected to identify in her conference speech as in need of reform to tackle the full range of crimes in the 21st century. She is to say that the financial crime legisation is required to provide clarity for the police and to address the myriad network of existing agencies to tackle city crime, all with overlapping structures, different responsibilities and different powers. The Libor rate scandal involved the manipulation by traders of the London Interbank Offered Rate in Britain which is used as a benchmark by financial institutions around the world and underpins contracts with a value of more than $300tn. The official inquiry, the Wheatley review, highlighted concerns that criminal sanctions for Libor manipulation were insufficient for enforcement or deterrence. It said it was unclear even if the law allows for charges to be brought despite its finding that the scandal had \"torn at the very fabric that our financial system is built on\". Cooper says that the public looked at what had happened and had seen no real sign of people being held to account. Cooper is expected to say: \"Look at the Libor scandal that emerged this summer. It is a multibillion pound fraud. People were fiddling figures to get rich, while small businesses paid the price.Yet no one has been arrested. The experts say it can't even be treated as a crime offence. The police and the SFO don't even seem to know where to start. \"In the United States they have seen 800 prosecutions for serious fraud since 2011. Here in the UK the SFO pursued just 20. If a mum can't afford her TV licence she'll end up in court. But defraud millions of pensioners or small businesses and you can get off scot-free.We need an end to the double standards. We need a new Economic Crime Act. People need to be able to invest with confidence knowing everyone is playing by the same fair rules.\" She says that the government, the police and other agencies all looked around but nobody was clear what crime had been committed or who should act. She claims it is the same with other financial crimes, such as serious fraud and money-laundering, which is costing the country an estimated \u00a338bn a year. The shadow home secretary is also to promise that Labour police and crime commissioners will halt the Tory rush to police privatisation with their \"nothing ruled out contract tenders that include neighbourhood patrols, detective investigations and more\". \"Pushing forces to sign massive contracts with a single organisation where value for money is at risk,\" she is expected to say. \"Have they learned nothing from the Olympics?\" Cooper will say that Labour recognised public private partnerships could be important in the police but tough tests had to be applied on value for money, transparency and accountability, resilience and security, and above all on public trust. \"We don't want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain,\" she is expected to say. \"We want police officers ... policing our communities \u2013 not private companies putting them under guard.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012. The comments that Yvette Cooper is expected to make in her speech have been changed in the light of updated information. It was further amended on 4 October 2012, to correct a figure of $300m to $300tn.",

      "bodyText": "Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has ruled out a multi-billion euro bailout before this weekend, despite the worsening economic situation and pleas from Madrid's neighbours for a resolution to the current crisis. Rajoy dismissed persistent speculation at a meeting of MPs that he was close to negotiating a rescue package with Brussels that could release up to \u20ac400bn in EU loans. His comments sent stock markets into reverse after a rally earlier in the day that gained momentum as a bailout appeared imminent. The FTSE fell 11 points to 5809 after a climb of 60 points in the morning on the expectation of a bailout announcement. Rajoy said Spain's financial situation would be helped if the 17 regional governments succeeded in cutting their annual spending deficits. Traders have become mesmerised by the twists and turns of the Spanish economy as it gets closer to joining Greece, Portugal and Ireland in formally requesting rescue funds from the European Financial Stability Facility. Rajoy, who is becoming notorious for procrastination, is understood to have asked for a delay until after elections in his home region of Galicia set for next month. The prime minister fears his PP party will lose the election if he is forced to accept a humiliating rescue package in advance of the vote. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is believed to have acceded to his request, after arguing that it would be easier for Brussels to focus on Madrid after Greece had been given the all-clear to receive its second bailout package. Talks between Greece and its lenders are dragging on as officials say the International Monetary Fund insists on stricter spending cuts before releasing funds. Troika officials have reportedly cast doubt over as much as \u20ac3bn worth of cuts at the heart of Athens' plan, leaving finance ministry officials pessimistic about agreeing upon the \u20ac11.5bn package acceptable to MPs before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this month. One official complained that \"it almost seems as if they want us to re-write the whole package\". Greek media said Poul Thomsen, the IMF's mission chief, had the \"harshest stance\", triggering fears that the Washington-based fund was working to a different agenda and did not want to resolve the package, or release the next \u20ac31.5bn tranche of aid, until after the US elections on 8 November. Troika officials, representing the EU, European Central Bank and IMF, denied a Reuters report 10 days ago that claimed their report would be held back until after the race for the White House. However, they have insisted that wages, pensions and benefits be further slashed, claiming such cuts will bring \"immediate results\". The Greek finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, is hoping that the troika's rounds of various ministries will produce \"enough evidence\" to prove that the proposed cuts can be implemented. Meanwhile City analysts remained optimistic that Spain would end the months long uncertainty and request a bailout. Spain's borrowing costs dropped 12 basis points to 5.77%, well down on the 7% they reached at the height of the crisis in the summer. \"There's a sense of optimism, but there are still a lot of hurdles that need to be cleared, so we have to be wary of that,\" said Orlando Green, a rate strategist at Credit Agricole. \"Today's [fall in yields] may prove to be just another leg in an up-and-down move \u2026 There could be more volatility in the future.\" Markets are also waiting on the outcome of a Moody's rating review, in which Spain could lose its investment grade rating.

In a statement, JP Morgan has claimed the case was brought \"without ever offering us an opportunity to rebut the claims and without developing a full record \u2014 instead relying on recycled claims already made by private plaintiffs.\" Coffee said: \"They wanted to bring this case quickly. A cynic might say they wanted to bring it before the election to show they are doing something.\" Peter Henning, a professor of law at Wayne State University, said the case was important because it was the first broad action brought by Obama's team. \"The case says this was a pattern of behavior, not some small specific wrongdoing,\" he said. \"But then it's an action against a defunct firm. You aren't going to see any significant reforms here,\" he said. Henning also said he did not expect any money to back to mortgage holders. The case is likely to lead to a settlement that will be paid out to other large institutions, not individuals. \"If they are leading with their strongest suit, my reaction is largely a shrug of the shoulders,\" Henning said. Annemarie McAvoy of Fordham University, a former federal prosecutor, said this case was likely to be the \"opening salvo\" in a series of cases. \"Clearly there were a lot of problems. It hasn't been as easy for regulators to bring cases as they would have liked.\" \"But it wasn't JP Morgan that was responsible here,\" she said.",

It's a nonsense that the deadline for implementation of the ringfencing proposals has been set for 2019.

As it happens, Lloyds Banking Group has already pledged to speed up the erection of its fences \u2013 but its rivals should too.

But don't get carried away with the idea that the \"break up the banks\" passage of the Labour leader's speech was truly radical. A radical version would say that a breakup would be good in itself for competition. For example: why not let Halifax, currently laughably described as a \"challenger\" retail brand even though it is housed within the market-leading Lloyds group, swim free? How about forcing NatWest to escape from Royal Bank of Scotland and provide some stiffer competition in business banking? Miliband is not on that territory. Ending the requirement for companies to report on a quarterly basis is a good idea, endorsed by John Kay's recent review into the cause of short-termism in the City. Many big businesses will applaud, which makes for an easy political win. It will be harder to argue the case for disenfranchising nasty hedge funds who swoop in search of a swift kill when a takeover bid is tabled. Equal rights for equal economic risk is a fine and established principle in normal times \u2013 and nobody has yet found a trouble-free way to limit its application during bids.",

    "webTitle": "Separate risky financial activities from retail banking, EU report recommends", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU has unveiled proposals that would force banks to separate their risky trading activities from their high street operations in the latest effort by policymakers to prevent a rerun of the 2008 banking crisis. The high level report for European commissioner Michel Barnier also proposes that senior bankers should have part of their bonuses paid in bonds, which could ultimately be used to prop up ailing banks and a lid be put on the total amounts that can be handed out to staff. One proposal is that bonus payments to staff should not be greater than dividends paid to shareholders. He also suggests that the size of bonuses relative to salaries be limited. The report by the Finnish central bank governor, Erkki Liikanen, is intended to prevent taxpayers needing to bail out banks again and is published at a time when politicians around the world are continuing to grapple with the issue of how to make banks safer. Among Liikanen's others suggestions are that loans to property companies should have different rules about the amount of capital that banks must hold to support the lending so that banks are not destabilised by a property crash. The report also calls for \"more attention\" to be given to the ability of management and bank directors to run large, complex banks and calls for \"fit and proper\" tests for boardroom candidates. Lawyers said Liikanen's proposals \u2013 which Barnier has now put out to six weeks' consultation \u2013 could have implications for the UK's coalition government, which is working towards implementing the ringfencing proposals set out by Sir John Vickers' Independent Commission on Banking. Paul Edmondson of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, said: \"If Brussels goes down the route of separating bank trading books the UK won't be able to prevent that being enforced here. What happens now to the proposed UK ringfence?\". Liikanen presented his proposals from Brussels just hours before Labour leader Ed Miliband refuelled the debate on the structure of British banking by threatening to go further than Vickers and break them up. \"Of course, this government promised change but things aren't really changing. So I've got a message for the banks. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Miliband said at the Labour party conference in Manchester Liikanen insisted he was not trying to completely to break up \"universal\" banks which unite investment banking and retail banking \u2013 such as Barclays, Deutsche bank in Germany and BNP Paribas in France \u2013 despite his demand for a \"legal\" separation between some of the riskier investment banking activities and high street banks. Liikanen's group builds upon the Volcker rule being adopted in the US \u2013 named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker \u2013 which prevents banks using their own money to take bet on markets through proprietary trading. Liikanen calls for proprietary trading of securities and derivatives to be legally split if the activities amount to 15 to 25% of a bank's total business. Such separation, Liikanen said, would make the deposit-taking parts of banks \"safer and less connected to high-risk trading activities and to limit the implicit or explicit stake of taxpayer in the trading parts of banking groups\". His report said that his recommendation for separation were \"fully compatible\" with the Vickers proposals although industry experts expressed concern about whether this was the case. \"The Liikanen group has taken what appears to be the mirror-image of the Vickers approach to the nettled issue of how to separate investment banking from retail and commercial banking. Vickers recommends ring fencing the retail and commercial bank; Liikanen would ring fence trading and market-making activity,\" said Thomas Huertas, partner in financial services at Ernst &amp; Young. Blueprints for bank regulation across Europe \u2022 International bank supervisors in Basel, Switzerland, intend to force banks to hold triple the capital required before the 2008 crisis \u2013 but only by 2019. \u2022 Sir John Vickers' banking commission has called for a \"ringfence\" to be erected to protect UK high street banks from their \"casino\" investment bank operations. Banks would have until 2019 to comply. \u2022 Labour leader Ed Miliband is threatening to break banks up unless they enact Vickers by 2015. \u2022 In the US, regulators are grappling with how to limit \"proprietary\" trading \u2013 when banks gamble with their own cash. It is called the Volcker rule \u2013 after former Fed chairman Paul Volcker \u2013 and is due to take effect by 2014. \u2022 The Liikanen report calls for a split between risky casino banking and high street banks. \u2022 The European Central Bank is urging banking union across the eurozone. The ECB could monitor all large banks \u2013 although this is still the subject of heated debate.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has enlivened the debate on executive pay by saying that being paid 20 times more than his average employee is too little, claiming to work \"50 times harder\". The outspoken chief executive of the Irish airline said his \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) pay last year made him \"the most underpaid and underappreciated airline boss in Europe\". O'Leary capped a boisterous interview with Management Today by stating that \"holidays are a complete waste of time\" and moaning about the charges imposed by his own airline when he does take his wife and four children abroad. He said: \"Of course I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.\" With a habitual dig at the rival airline that Ryanair has been blocked from taking over, O'Leary said: \"I'm paid about 20 times more than the average employee and I think that gap should be wider. I probably work 50 times harder. I was paid \u20ac1.2m last year for carrying 80 million passengers. Aer Lingus's boss [Christoph Mueller] got \u20ac1.3m for carrying 9 million passengers. I think I'm the most underpaid and underappreciated airline boss in Europe.\" O'Leary is not the first airline executive this year to draw attention to the size of his salary package, with Steve Ridgway of Virgin Atlantic saying his \u00a3350,000 a year pay was \"not as high as I'd like it to be and my bosses know that\", shortly before his departure was announced in September. However, O'Leary's views are unlikely to be interpreted as a similar come-and-get-me. He added: \"I'm probably unemployable, which is why a business as shitty as the airline industry is one where I can flourish.\"",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has enlivened the debate on executive pay by saying that being paid 20 times more than his average employee is too little, claiming to work \"50 times harder\".</p> <p>The outspoken chief executive of the Irish airline said his \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) pay last year made him \"the most underpaid and underappreciated airline boss in Europe\".</p> <p>O'Leary capped a boisterous interview with Management Today by stating that \"holidays are a complete waste of time\" and moaning about the charges imposed by his own airline when he does take his wife and four children abroad. He said: \"Of course I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.\"</p> <p>With a habitual dig at the rival airline that Ryanair has been blocked from taking over, O'Leary said: \"I'm paid about 20 times more than the average employee and I think that gap should be wider. I probably work 50 times harder. I was paid \u20ac1.2m last year for carrying 80 million passengers. Aer Lingus's boss [Christoph Mueller] got \u20ac1.3m for carrying 9 million passengers. I think I'm the most underpaid and underappreciated airline boss in Europe.\"</p> <p>O'Leary is not the first airline executive this year to draw attention to the size of his salary package, with Steve Ridgway of Virgin Atlantic saying his \u00a3350,000 a year pay was \"not as high as I'd like it to be and my bosses know that\", shortly before his departure was announced in September.</p> <p>However, O'Leary's views are unlikely to be interpreted as a similar come-and-get-me. He added: \"I'm probably unemployable, which is why a business as shitty as the airline industry is one where I can flourish.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The situation is \"very fluid and very advanced,\" said Tom Enders, boss of EADS, on Monday night about the plan to combine the aerospace group with BAE Systems. That, presumably, is the positive way to describe a situation that appears chaotic even as the first deadline to produce a merger document approaches. Indeed, the word \"fluid\" doesn't do justice to the position of Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, chairman of EADS and chief executive of its 7.5% shareholder Lagard\u00e8re, the French media firm that bears the family name. Wearing his EADS hat, he's fully supportive of the deal and its 60/40 ratio; wearing his second hat, he backs the Lagard\u00e8re corporate stance that the terms are \"currently unsatisfactory\" and thus an \"indispensable re-examination\" of the deal is required. The hopeful thought \u2013 at least for Enders and his BAE counterpart, Ian King - is that the objections of Lagard\u00e8re, and fellow shareholder Daimler, over price could evaporate once governments get involved. That assumption looks far from safe, however, since the Enders/King vision of a company that confers the same rights on all shareholders appears fundamentally different from any version being contemplated in Paris and Berlin. In those capitals, the debate is all about how large a slice of the shares the two governments should keep, not as a pure investment but to retain influence and control. Even that negotiation, however, will be sterile if, say, 9% apiece gets the thumbs down in Washington. In that case, there would be no point in proceeding with the merger since BAE's privileged status in the US defence market would be undermined. The only encouraging news for Enders and King is that no government has yet said anything that would definitively kill the deal. It is still possible that all the various pieces of the jigsaw could fall into place. But the minimum definition of a deal that can be presented to shareholders \u2013 which is what EADS and BAE hope to announce by next Wednesday \u2013 is one where the governments of the UK, France and Germany have agreed on governance arrangements and shareholding structure. Further, the companies must be able to claim credibly that the US is at least prepared to contemplate allowing the merger to proceed. The first hurdle is high, in other words. Of course, Enders and King could opt to delay for a week or two. But that's a dangerous course too since resentment will only deepen if EADS' share price continues to sit 16% below its pre-leak level. Best to try to hurry the governments along. But the odds on a clean announcement next week already look 50/50 at best. This deal makes Glenstrata look straightforward.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The French wellington boot-maker Le Chameau, which is a firm favourite of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is set to be snapped up by private equity firm Marwyn Management Partners for \u20ac16.5m. The brand, founded in 1927 in Normandy, is about a third the size of its biggest rival, Hunter, but private equity bosses believe it has great expansion potential, especially since its royal fans have been pictured on several occasions sporting the handcrafted boots, which cost up to \u00a3550 a pair. Last year, Le Chameau posted net sales of \u20ac24m (\u00a319.2m). By comparison, UK rival Hunter had sales of \u00a378m last year. Le Chameau's parent company, the skiwear and camping equipment firm Lafuma, wants to offload the business to focus more on its outdoor sports market instead. Mark Watts, executive director of Marwyn, said: \"Le Chameau is a brand with an exceptional heritage and product of the very highest quality. \"We look forward to progressing the transaction to completion in the coming weeks and then helping to grow the business and develop it as a truly international luxury brand.\" Sales of Le Chameau's \u00a3160 Vierzonard boots jumped by a third after the duchess was pictured wearing a pair at a charity event this summer. Sales of men's boots also increased on the back of the \"duchess effect\". The royal connection will no doubt help increase the company's identity, but the biggest profit boosts are expected to come from expanding markets in Asia, where consumers are keen to show off their wealth with high-end goods and clothing. The investment is Marwyn's first foray into the luxury goods market after focusing on construction groups and then moving into software and media. The equity firm focuses in buying small- and medium-sized firms worth up to \u00a3500m. One of its biggest deals was in 2007 when it bought and floated for $200m (\u00a3125m) the film and television distributor Entertainment One, the company behind the releases of the Twilight film franchise and the Peppa Pig TV series. Meanwhile, Hunter has reported a 38% increase in sales in 2011 to \u00a378m, with sales in the UK up 53%, US sales up 11% and international sales elsewhere rising 66%. Its Regent, Glitter and Gloss Original boots sold particularly well, according to the company, while its Balmoral leather Hawksworth boot, costing \u00a3285, won new footwear product of the year at the shooting industry awards. The US private equity firm Searchlight Capital bought a majority stake in the business last December, announcing plans for an international expansion, which appear to be working. Searchlight's chairman, Oliver Haarmann, said: \"In 2011, Hunter continued to see success in both fashion and traditional country markets. Europe and the far east drove a favourable international performance whilst product development also contributed to strong sales. Going forward, even with the challenging market conditions, we will continue to invest in the Hunter brand, supporting its development in the digital environment and the expansion of the Hunter business across the globe.\"",

Sales of men's boots also increased on the back of the \"duchess effect\".</p> <p>The royal connection will no doubt help increase the company's identity, but the biggest profit boosts are expected to come from expanding markets in Asia, where consumers are keen to show off their wealth with high-end goods and clothing.</p> <p>The investment is Marwyn's first foray into the luxury goods market after focusing on construction groups and then moving into software and media. The equity firm focuses in buying small- and medium-sized firms worth up to \u00a3500m.</p> <p>One of its biggest deals was in 2007 when it bought and floated for $200m (\u00a3125m) the film and television distributor Entertainment One, the company behind the releases of the Twilight film franchise and the Peppa Pig TV series.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Retail_and_leisure/article1136816.ece\" title=\"\">Hunter has reported a 38% increase in sales in 2011 to \u00a378m</a>, with sales in the UK up 53%, US sales up 11% and international sales elsewhere rising 66%.</p> <p>Its Regent, Glitter and Gloss Original boots sold particularly well, according to the company, while its Balmoral leather Hawksworth boot, costing \u00a3285, won new footwear product of the year at the shooting industry awards.</p> <p>The US private equity firm Searchlight Capital bought a majority stake in the business last December, announcing plans for an international expansion, which appear to be working.</p> <p>Searchlight's chairman, Oliver Haarmann, said: \"In 2011, Hunter continued to see success in both fashion and traditional country markets. Europe and the far east drove a favourable international performance whilst product development also contributed to strong sales. Going forward, even with the challenging market conditions, we will continue to invest in the Hunter brand, supporting its development in the digital environment and the expansion of the Hunter business across the globe.\"</p>",

    "webTitle": "Peat supplier blames summer rains for shortage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest peat supplier has warned that the awful summer could leave garden centres struggling to grow enough plants, after admitting it had been unable to harvest the nation's waterlogged bogs. William Sinclair Holdings issued a profits warning on Tuesday, saying it had only been able to achieve about a fifth of its normal annual harvest of about 570,000 cubic metres of peat. \"With the lousy sunshine we haven't had five solid days of sunshine to allow the [harvest] cycle to take place,\" said Peter Williams, its finance director. Peat, which is the key ingredient in compost, is harvested by loosening the top couple of inches of the bog, letting it dry and then turning it over before collecting it. \"The cycle takes four to five days \u2013 if it rains during that time you have to start all over again,\" Williams said. \"Over a normal summer season you might [harvest the same bog] 10 times, this year we've had one-and-half harvests on average. It's not just us \u2013 everyone is really short of peat out there.\" He warned that the shortage \u2013 which is also affecting the world's other top producers in Ireland, Scandinavia and the Baltic states \u2013 may lead to a scarcity of plants in garden centres. \"They are really going to struggle going forward as there is just not enough peat,\" Williams said, adding that nurseries and garden centres will be affected more than household gardeners because intensive plant growers require \"a particular quality of peat and they are much less trusting of peat-free alternatives\". Williams added that when peat harvests are low, alternatives, such as recycled garden waste or ground down trees, can be used in household compost. He hoped the peat crisis may trigger an uptake in peat-free alternatives. But creating alternatives as good as peat was difficult because \"peat is like a blank piece of paper with no nutrients and you can add whatever you like\", while most alternatives already have some nutrients included, Williams said. Environmentalists have long campaigned for peat harvesting to be banned because it is very carbon-intensive. And, Williams said, supermarkets have been trying to persuade customers to move away from peat composts because of corporate social responsibility pledges. Friends of the Earth's head of policy and campaigns Craig Bennett \u2013 who sat on the Government's peat task force said: \"The industry's future lies in the development of peat-free alternatives, but the sector has been far too slow to embrace change. Peat bogs are valuable wildlife sites which 'lock in' carbon - they shouldn't be dug up and destroyed. Gardeners and garden centres can play their part too, by insisting on peat-free products.\" William Sinclair has recently developed an alternative made from household garden waste, which Williams said was \"almost as good\" as peat. The new product is made from ground-down woody bits of plants. Production of the peat alternative has recently started at a factory in Doncaster and the company has won planning permission for a second factory operating 24/7 in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. William Sinclair warned investors that the shortage will lead to a collapse in annual profits from \u00a33.2m last year to low hundreds of thousands this year. The company owns about 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of peat bogs, mostly in Cumbria and south of Edinburgh.",

But creating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/peat-free-compost/alternatives\" title=\"\">alternatives</a> as good as peat was difficult because \"peat is like a blank piece of paper with no nutrients and you can add whatever you like\", while most alternatives already have some nutrients included, Williams said.</p> <p>Environmentalists have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2009/may/28/chelseaflowershow-gardens\" title=\"\">long campaigned for peat harvesting to be banned</a> because it is very carbon-intensive. And, Williams said, supermarkets have been trying to persuade customers to move away from peat composts because of corporate social responsibility pledges.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's head of policy and campaigns Craig Bennett \u2013 who sat on the Government's peat task force said:</p> <p>\"The industry's future lies in the development of peat-free alternatives, but the sector has been far too slow to embrace change. Peat bogs are valuable wildlife sites which 'lock in' carbon - they shouldn't be dug up and destroyed. Gardeners and garden centres can play their part too, by insisting on peat-free products.\"</p> <p>William Sinclair has recently developed an alternative made from household garden waste, which Williams said was \"almost as good\" as peat.</p> <p>The new product is made from ground-down woody bits of plants. Production of the peat alternative has recently started at a factory in Doncaster and the company has won planning permission for a second factory operating 24/7 in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.</p> <p>William Sinclair warned investors that the shortage will lead to a collapse in annual profits from \u00a33.2m last year to low hundreds of thousands this year.</p> <p>The company owns about 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of peat bogs, mostly in Cumbria and south of Edinburgh.</p>",
