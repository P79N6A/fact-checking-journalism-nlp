      "bodyText": "The mass slaughter of millions of farm animals across the world is expected to push food prices to their highest ever levels. As well as hitting consumers' pockets, the predicted 14% jump in food prices will also dash the Bank of England's hopes of pushing inflation down to 2% by next year. Farmers across the world have begun a mass slaughter of their pig and cattle herds because they cannot afford the cost of feed, which has soared following the worst US drought in living memory, according to a report published on Wednesday. Experts at investment bank Rabobank warn that the mass \"herd liquidation\" will contribute to a 14% jump in the price of the average basket of food by next summer. On Tuesday, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) said lower food prices had helped bring inflation down to 2.5% in August. That brings it closer to the Bank's 2% target and should help consumers who have seen their spending power shrink as wages fail to match inflation. The Bank expects inflation to ease below the 2% target by early next year, but that could be scuppered by rising food, oil and commodity prices. Rabobank said the slaughter of millions of pigs has already led to a 31% increase in the price of pork and the costs of other meats are also expected to soar as \"US livestock herds are likely to be liquidated at an accelerating pace in the first half of 2013\". Nicholas Higgins, a Rabobank commodities analyst and author of the report, said: \"There will be an initial glut in meat availability as people slaughter their animals to reduce their feed bills. But by next year herds will be so reduced that there won't be enough animals to meet expected demand and prices will soar.\" US farmers, who are suffering from the worst drought since the 1930s, have already reduced their cattle herd to the smallest since 1973. While all meat lovers will be affected by the record-breaking price rises, Higgins said bacon butty fans may suffer the biggest increases because it is easier for farmers to slash and rebuild pig herds that cattle. \"Farmers cut back pigs because they can rebuild them the quickest. Replacement cattle take a lot longer to breed \u2013 a year and a half compared to six months for pigs,\" he said. The report said the mass slaughter of pigs had led to a steep decline in the price of pork for delivery next month, but a 31% increase for pork delivered in July 2013. Because meat and dairy products already account for 52% of the cost of the average global basket of food Rabobank predicts the overall price of the basket will soar to a record 243 on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) index next summer. If Higgins' prediction is correct it will be the highest the index has ever reached and 175% higher than it was in 2000. Higgins said he did not expect a repeat of the 2007-8 food riots in developing countries across the world because most meat is consumed in the west. \"People are less likely to be irate over meat prices when they can switch back to staples \u2013 an option not available in 07/08 due to severe shortages of wheat and rice,\" he said. \"The risk [of riots and social unrest] is still there but it is not as high as 07-08. The prices will hurt here [in the west] more.\" But he said western consumers are unlikely to significantly change their diets or become vegetarian in response to price rises. Higgins said the major danger to global stability was the threat of countries stockpiling supplies. \"We've already seen the first indications of that, with Indonesia hinting it is going to increase corn stock pile levels, South Korea considering a domestic purchasing regime and very strong wheat purchases in Iran disproportionately higher than in its past history.\" While the food price spike is likely to lead to an increase in starvation and malnutrition across the world, global food traders are expecting bumper profits.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene has become one of the most senior figures in corporate Britain to publicly back recruitment quotas for women in the workplace \u2013 including the boardroom. Greene told an audience at the Communications Workers Union's women's section in Peterborough she was prepared to publicly champion quotas, despite many of her peers in business having lobbied furiously to block such a move from Brussels. \"There is something about the UK \u2013 for all its egalitarianism, women are not represented as they should be in society or companies,\" Greene said. Despite modest moves in the right direction, expectations for women in the workplace were changing at a \"glacial pace\". She told the union delegates: \"If you want quotas, I am open to leading that discussion.\" Greene, a Canadian, said she had been struck by the lack of women generally at Royal Mail, but most particularly in leadership positions, during her two years as chief executive. At Canada Post, where she previously worked, Greene said women made up 43% of the workforce and 50% of the senior management team. She noted that Royal Mail was far from an isolated example of a male-dominated British workforce. The postal group's chief executive saidshe had encountered similar imbalances in management roles elsewhere in corporate Britain. Greene's remarks come as the business secretary, Vince Cable, has been leading the fight against attempts to introduce a 40% female quota on stock market-listed company boards across the European Union. With counterparts from nine countries, including Malta, Latvia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Estonia, he has written to European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso registering opposition. \"We agree with the commission's stance that there are still too few women on the boards of publicly listed companies,\" said the letter. \"[But] we reiterate that any targeted measures in this area should be devised and implemented at national level.\" Lord Davies of Abersoch was commissioned by UK government to look at ways to redress boardroom gender bias. His report last year did not recommend quotas, which he has repeatedly described as \"a mistake\". He advocates a target of 25% female representation on FTSE 100 boards by 2015, relying on self-regulation to get there. Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"Continuing with the current approach means excluding another generation of women from the top table of business. The time has come to take radical action. \"All the evidence shows positive action through the use of quotas is the only sure fire way to ensure more women reach the boardroom. Wishful thinking and encouraging words are not going to bring about the step change we urgently need.\" Greene told the women delegates that although the recruitment industry is overwhelmingly female, the lists they send for jobs are predominantly male. \"I've sent back the lists and have told others to do the same \u2013 it's almost a campaign.\" She recalled having to do the same thing in her previous job. \"At Canada Post I had to say we wouldn't accept male, white lists.\" In response to questions, she conceded that more part-time work was required \"for the flexibility that this company needs\". But she did not agree that the view that all women with children could do was part time work. Recalling her own experience as a single parent bringing up a daughter, she said: \"We need to find ways to get women to work full-time with children.\" Greene said her enthusiasm for quotas stemmed from seeing what they achieved during her time working in the Canadian civil service. She recalled how, when starting out on her own career in the federal civil service of Canada, no woman taking a senior role could be married. \"We made progress in the civil service when we had quotas. I am not personally against quotas at all. Unless you have quotas and live by them, you won't see change in this company or the country.\"",

      "bodyText": "The ailing Greek economy is on the verge of a 1930s-style Great Depression, as the Athens government predicted a 25% fall in GDP by 2014, putting intense pressure on the EU to relax the terms on the country's \u20ac130bn (\u00a3105bn) bailout package The finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, said a decline in tax revenues and spiralling unemployment will deepen the country's four-year recession, which critics of the EU's stance said could lead to a recession as long and deep as America's pre-war decline. Stournaras, who is locked in negotiations over the terms of a second bailout, fears that efforts to revive the Greek economy will be undermined by a draconian austerity programme, early debt repayments and high interest rates on its loans. \"The cumulative reduction (of gross domestic product) since 2008 is just under 20% and is expected to reach 25% by 2014,\" he told a Greek\u2013Chinese business forum in Athens. \"The time frame for the adjustment, the conditions of the real economy should be taken into consideration,\" he said. \"Otherwise there is a great risk of prolonging the negative consequences for the economy and society.\" The finance minister made the plea after revealing that while Greece would meet its nominal 2012 deficit reduction targets, its primary deficit would reach 1.5% of GDP compared to the projected 1% following a sharp decline in the economy's output. Concerns that the economic situation is deteriorating faster than expected in Greece, Spain and Portugal dragged down stock markets, which have rallied in recent weeks on better news from the eurozone and expectations, confirmed on Friday, that the Federal Reserve would inject more new money into the US economy. The FTSE 100 declined for a second day, to 5868, while the Dow Jones industrial average in New York was off 10 points at 13,542 by mid afternoon. The Greek coalition government, led by the right-wing leader Antonis Samaras, is under pressure from left of centre parties and unions to win concessions on plans for 50,000 public sector job cuts, tax rises and employment reforms applied to a second bailout by the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, known as the \"troika\". Unions have called a general strike for 26 September and several key MPs in the coalition have threatened to quit rather than implement the cuts. Stournaras won the backing of the world's major banks in its efforts to win better terms after Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the spokesman for Greece's creditors, said a commitment by Greece to make reforms should immediately be rewarded. \"Once that has been done, and I am confident it will be done, Europe and the IMF should move quickly to extend the adjustment period for at least two years and provide the modest additional financial support for that extension to be effective,\" Dallara said. The IIF represents lenders to indebted eurozone countries, among them major US, UK and eurozone banks alongside several hedge funds and insurance groups.

This can easily be realised in part by reducing interest rates on the loans which Europe and the IMF made to Greece on more concessional terms,\" adding that responses to the Greek debt crisis placed too much emphasis on short-term austerity and not enough on improving the country's longer-term competitiveness. Officials in Brussels are keen to soften the troika's attitude towards Greece to ease the sense of crisis and shore up fading support for key countries in the single currency. But a deep split between the north and south in the eurozone appeared to be as wide as ever after Austria and Finland repeated their insistence that Greece be made to implement cuts agreed under the original terms of the \u20ac130bn bailout package. Finland's Europe minister said he was sceptical about giving Greece more time to implement its bailout reforms, especially if this will cost more money, although he said nothing should be ruled out yet. \"We are sceptical about giving more time, especially if it means more money, but we should not exclude any options at this stage,\" said Alexander Stubb. Austria's finance minister took an even harder line at the weekend, saying Athens would only get \"a few weeks\", before it begins to implement the package of cuts and tax rises. Northern states, which provide the bulk of EU loans, have resisted offering relaxed terms to Athens after its failure to introduce reforms under an earlier \u20ac110bn bailout. Germany's foreign ministry is understood to be prepared to back a compromise deal, but with strict limits on extra cash payments. Economists are sceptical Greece can survive without a long holiday from debt repayments and a cut in its interest bill.

      "bodyText": "Everyone's an ethical banker these days, aren't they? Aren't chief executives falling over themselves to proclaim that their organisations take seriously their responsibilities to society? The Co-operative Bank interrupted this pleasing narrative as it announced it would no longer offer basic banking services to new customers who are undischarged bankrupts. Before hissing the Co-op's decision, listen to its reasons: it and Barclays are the only major banks offering the service to undischarged bankrupts; and, since these basic accounts are essentially a cost to the provider, it's unfair for other banks to expect the duo to do all the industry's work in practising the principle of \"inclusive banking\". It's a fair point, and one can understand why Co-op felt it had to act. It operates 330,000 basic bank accounts (those with no overdraft facility but access to direct debits and standing orders) and almost a third have originated out of some form of court order or bankruptcy. Think of Co-op's move, then, as an attempt to embarrass bigger rivals, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, into pulling their weight. Indeed, the Co-op says it will review its decision if others \"genuinely perform on this issue\". But it's depressing that the fight should have to happen in public. In a rational world, the matter would be settled quickly and quietly in a high-level pow-wow organised by the British Bankers' Association, the trade body. The BBA has plenty to think about these days \u2013 like how to recover its reputation after the Libor scandal \u2013 but surely it could spare 10 minutes to bang heads together on this issue.",

Aren't chief executives falling over themselves to proclaim that their organisations take seriously their responsibilities to society?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/18/banks-help-bankrupt-co-op-boss\" title=\"\">Co-operative Bank interrupted this pleasing narrative</a> as it announced it would no longer offer basic banking services to new customers who are undischarged bankrupts. Before hissing the Co-op's decision, listen to its reasons: it and Barclays are the only major banks offering the service to undischarged bankrupts; and, since these basic accounts are essentially a cost to the provider, it's unfair for other banks to expect the duo to do all the industry's work in practising the principle of \"inclusive banking\".</p> <p>It's a fair point, and one can understand why Co-op felt it had to act. It operates 330,000 basic bank accounts (those with no overdraft facility but access to direct debits and standing orders) and almost a third have originated out of some form of court order or bankruptcy.</p> <p>Think of Co-op's move, then, as an attempt to embarrass bigger rivals, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, into pulling their weight. Indeed, the Co-op says it will review its decision if others \"genuinely perform on this issue\".</p> <p>But it's depressing that the fight should have to happen in public. In a rational world, the matter would be settled quickly and quietly in a high-level pow-wow organised by the British Bankers' Association, the trade body. The BBA has plenty to think about these days \u2013 like how to recover its reputation after the Libor scandal \u2013 but surely it could spare 10 minutes to bang heads together on this issue.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>United Utilities</strong> bubbled up the FTSE 100 on renewed takeover speculation.</p> <p>A month ago the water group was touted as a possible target for a bid, with a range of predators mentioned, including the Ontario Teachers pension fund from Canada, China Investment Corporation, private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Abu Dhabi funds.</p> <p>Now traders were again hearing talk of a possible 900p-950p offer, which was enough to push the company 19p higher to 707.5p, a near 3% rise in a falling market. At the time of August's reports, analyst Guillaume Redgwell at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> These assets are attractive to foreign infrastructure funds and in the long run we see it as likely that the remaining pure play UK water companies could pass into private hands. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 25.36 points to 5868.16, its second day of decline as investors remained cautious after last week's rises. Worries about whether Spain would request a bailout refused to die down, while the Greek talks to hammer out an agreement about the terms of its bailout continued to drag on.</p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> fell 14.3p to 344.9p as the City started to think the insurer's shares may have gone too far after their recent rise. Deutsche Bank moved from buy to hold and cut its target price from 375p to 370p, saying there was no room for the company's new strategy to fail:</p> <blockquote> Aviva's share price has lifted more than 40% since its June lows. Though much of this has been driven by the improved macro backdrop, it also reflects greater confidence in Aviva itself following the unveiling of the new management strategy in July. We remain strongly supportive of the group's plans; however, even if these are delivered in full (which for the cost savings won't be clear before 2014), the narrowing PE discount to the sector now leaves little room for disappointment. On valuation grounds, therefore, we downgrade to hold. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation from neutral to underperform with a 360p price target. It said:</p> <blockquote> We think upcoming restructuring efforts intended to refocus the business and build greater balance sheet buffers are likely to be dilutive. Aviva has identified a number of non-core businesses accounting for around 10p of earnings per share (\u00a3300m). The dilutive impact of any disposals will be partially offset by cost cuts. Making a prudent allowance for both, we estimate an 'adjusted' PE of close to 8 times. Additionally, we think it is appropriate to assume 50p-60p of... book value erosion in the event of a US disposal, which would push the book value multiple above 1 times. We believe Aviva looks fully valued on this basis. <br>  And particularly so given a number of challenges in its UK and European life businesses in the coming 1-2 years. Despite some support from a high dividend yield, Aviva shares are relatively unattractive compared to its European composite insurer peer group, in our view. </blockquote> <p>The riskier end of the market - miners and banks - were unsurprisingly among the main fallers, with more defensive areas such as utilities and tobacco on the rise.</p> <p>So <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> added 89p to \u00a332.43, helped by Nomura raising its target price from \u00a333.90 to \u00a335. The bank lifted its price objective for <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong>, up 44p to \u00a323.62, from \u00a321.97 to \u00a322.30.</p> <p><strong>Diageo</strong>, the Guinness and spirits group, also benefited from a positive note from Nomura, up 34.5p to \u00a317.18. Nomura said:</p> <blockquote> Following the Mey Icki acquisition in Turkey and good growth in eastern Europe, we now see a bigger weighting to growth markets in the company's Europe division (25% versus 15% previously) which accounted in 2012 for 27% of group earnings before interest and tax. Our recent visit to the company in Russia gave us confidence of strong momentum across the eastern Europe region, with the company now gaining leadership of whiskey in Russia. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> lost 7.3p to 267.1p after another broker cut its recommendation after recent rises in the share price.</p> <p>Cormac Leech at Liberum Capital moved from buy to hold with a 270p target price, saying there was unlikely to be any immediate catalyst to drive the price higher. But he said there were a number of risks:</p> <blockquote> Incremental payment protection insurance costs: as of June 12, \u00a31.3bn had been provisioned versus \u00a30.7bn paid out in redress with limited visibility on the final PPI cost at this point; LIBOR fines and litigation - our 270p target price assumes a \u00a32bn total impact (net of tax) related to alleged LIBOR rigging. <br> </blockquote> <p>On Monday Ian Gordon at Investec also downgraded, moving from hold to sell:</p> <p>Among the retailers, <strong>Debenhams </strong>was steady at 99.45p after a better than expected trading update which led the retailer to say it would meet market expectations for the year. Like for like sales for the 10 weeks to the beginning of September rose 3.7%, compared to forecasts of up to 2% growth. Poor summer weather, the current tough consumer climate and the distractions of the Olympics have all hit other retailers with <strong>Next</strong>, down 1p at \u00a334, last week warning that its sales in August and September had been disappointing.</p> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> lost 3.9p to 69.7p as investors caught up with a couple of recent negative notes on the online grocer.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Restore</strong>, a document management and office relocation business, added 1p to 94p after a 31% rise in half year profits. House broker Cenkos said:</p> <blockquote> Restore has reported a strong set of interim results in a period which has seen both the consolidation of acquired businesses and refined the investment proposition through the disposal of non-core operations. As a leading player within its target markets we believe that the company is well positioned to continue its impressive track record of organic growth plus further bolt-on acquisitions financed through its strong cash generation. <br> </blockquote>",

Overall the FTSE 100 fell 25.36 points to 5868.16, its second day of decline as investors remained cautious after last week's rises. Worries about whether Spain would request a bailout refused to die down, while the Greek talks to hammer out an agreement about the terms of its bailout continued to drag on. Aviva fell 14.3p to 344.9p as the City started to think the insurer's shares may have gone too far after their recent rise. Deutsche Bank moved from buy to hold and cut its target price from 375p to 370p, saying there was no room for the company's new strategy to fail: Aviva's share price has lifted more than 40% since its June lows. Though much of this has been driven by the improved macro backdrop, it also reflects greater confidence in Aviva itself following the unveiling of the new management strategy in July. We remain strongly supportive of the group's plans; however, even if these are delivered in full (which for the cost savings won't be clear before 2014), the narrowing PE discount to the sector now leaves little room for disappointment. On valuation grounds, therefore, we downgrade to hold. Meanwhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation from neutral to underperform with a 360p price target. It said: We think upcoming restructuring efforts intended to refocus the business and build greater balance sheet buffers are likely to be dilutive. Aviva has identified a number of non-core businesses accounting for around 10p of earnings per share (\u00a3300m). The dilutive impact of any disposals will be partially offset by cost cuts. Making a prudent allowance for both, we estimate an 'adjusted' PE of close to 8 times. Additionally, we think it is appropriate to assume 50p-60p of... book value erosion in the event of a US disposal, which would push the book value multiple above 1 times. We believe Aviva looks fully valued on this basis. And particularly so given a number of challenges in its UK and European life businesses in the coming 1-2 years. Despite some support from a high dividend yield, Aviva shares are relatively unattractive compared to its European composite insurer peer group, in our view. The riskier end of the market - miners and banks - were unsurprisingly among the main fallers, with more defensive areas such as utilities and tobacco on the rise. So British American Tobacco added 89p to \u00a332.43, helped by Nomura raising its target price from \u00a333.90 to \u00a335. The bank lifted its price objective for Imperial Tobacco, up 44p to \u00a323.62, from \u00a321.97 to \u00a322.30. Diageo, the Guinness and spirits group, also benefited from a positive note from Nomura, up 34.5p to \u00a317.18. Nomura said: Following the Mey Icki acquisition in Turkey and good growth in eastern Europe, we now see a bigger weighting to growth markets in the company's Europe division (25% versus 15% previously) which accounted in 2012 for 27% of group earnings before interest and tax. Our recent visit to the company in Russia gave us confidence of strong momentum across the eastern Europe region, with the company now gaining leadership of whiskey in Russia. But Royal Bank of Scotland lost 7.3p to 267.1p after another broker cut its recommendation after recent rises in the share price. Cormac Leech at Liberum Capital moved from buy to hold with a 270p target price, saying there was unlikely to be any immediate catalyst to drive the price higher. But he said there were a number of risks: Incremental payment protection insurance costs: as of June 12, \u00a31.3bn had been provisioned versus \u00a30.7bn paid out in redress with limited visibility on the final PPI cost at this point; LIBOR fines and litigation - our 270p target price assumes a \u00a32bn total impact (net of tax) related to alleged LIBOR rigging. On Monday Ian Gordon at Investec also downgraded, moving from hold to sell: Among the retailers, Debenhams was steady at 99.45p after a better than expected trading update which led the retailer to say it would meet market expectations for the year. Like for like sales for the 10 weeks to the beginning of September rose 3.7%, compared to forecasts of up to 2% growth. Poor summer weather, the current tough consumer climate and the distractions of the Olympics have all hit other retailers with Next, down 1p at \u00a334, last week warning that its sales in August and September had been disappointing. Ocado lost 3.9p to 69.7p as investors caught up with a couple of recent negative notes on the online grocer. Finally Restore, a document management and office relocation business, added 1p to 94p after a 31% rise in half year profits. House broker Cenkos said: Restore has reported a strong set of interim results in a period which has seen both the consolidation of acquired businesses and refined the investment proposition through the disposal of non-core operations. As a leading player within its target markets we believe that the company is well positioned to continue its impressive track record of organic growth plus further bolt-on acquisitions financed through its strong cash generation.",

      "bodyText": "High inflation has been a crucial factor in pushing the UK economy into a double-dip recession over the past year. Prices have been rising faster than wages and that has left consumers with less money to spend. The weakness of consumer demand has made businesses reluctant to invest in new capacity, even in cases where access to finance has not been a problem. The crisis in the eurozone has certainly made matters worse but it has been the squeeze on real incomes that has really been responsible for leaving Britain in the doldrums. Given the poor performance of the economy, it was something of a surprise to learn on Tuesday that the annual increase in the cost of living is still running at 2.5% even after this latest 0.1 point drop. Higher food and fuel prices are the reason inflation is coming down more slowly than the Bank of England has anticipated, although it is running at less than half its recent 5.2% peak in the autumn of 2011. The good news for George Osborne and Sir Mervyn King, therefore, is that consumers are not being squeezed as hard as they were this time last year. The bad news is that spending power is still being eroded, only less ferociously. Inflation should continue to edge down over the coming months as last year's sharp increases in domestic fuel prices cease to boost the annual rate, and there is evidence that clothing, footwear and household goods stores are cutting prices in an attempt to attract a few customers. But UK inflation has proved \"sticky\" and there are price increases in the pipeline that may delay the drop in the CPI measure of the cost of living to its 2% target. The biggest single threat comes from dearer food after the worst US drought in half a century, but higher university tuition fees will also be a factor to watch. Against this backdrop, it is hard to see the economy emerging from its torpor soon. Activity will continue to bump along the bottom until real incomes start to rise, triggering an increase in business spending. The Bank of England will pay little heed to above-target inflation provided it can be explained away by external factors such as oil prices, leaving the door ajar for further policy easing towards the end of the year.",

The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_278917.pdf\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics (ONS) said</a> annual consumer price inflation came down to 2.5% in August, from 2.6% in July, in line with analyst expectations. Retail price inflation \u2013 which includes the cost of mortgages and council tax \u2013 eased to 2.9% from 3.2% in July.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, Markit</h2> <p>Good news as UK inflation fell in August, as expected, helping to alleviate the squeeze on incomes that has plagued households over the past two years. However, incomes continue to fall in real terms due to weak pay growth, and rising oil and food prices have the potential to keep inflation higher than anticipated by policymakers over the next few months. While the damaging effect on consumer spending is not likely to be anything like as marked as late last year, the persistence of high inflation and weak pay growth means consumer spending could well disappoint in the final few months of 2012.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, BNP Paribas</h2> <p>This release will assuage some fears that underlying inflationary pressure is firming. Most obviously the CPI inflation rate has fallen. But also the fairly broadly based decline will be welcome. So, while it is certainly the case that compared with a few months ago the near-term outlook for inflation is firmer, most of that firming looks to be coming from higher energy and food prices. Core inflation is back at 2.1%, the level it was at in June, and there is little reason to see underlying inflation as anything but contained.</p> <h2>Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics</h2> <p>July's core inflation rate had been boosted by the earlier than usual end to high street sales and a sharp Olympics-related rise in air fares inflation, so a drop back in August had always looked likely. Admittedly, the recent increase in oil prices has meant that inflation is falling at a somewhat slower pace than seemed likely a few months ago. Nonetheless, oil prices have levelled off in recent weeks. What's more, inflation should drop to a greater extent in September \u2013 perhaps to 2% \u2013 as we reach the anniversary of last year's utility price hikes. Meanwhile, the weak economy should push core price pressures down further, keeping inflation low next year. As a result, we doubt that the outlook for inflation will dissuade the monetary policy committee (MPC) from announcing more asset purchases later this year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The easing back in consumer price inflation in August supports belief that the Bank of England will enact further stimulus to help the economy in the fourth quarter, despite some recent improved news on economic activity.</p> <p>Although there is a risk that inflation will be sticky over the coming months, and despite some recent improved data and surveys, extended weak economic activity rather than inflation remains by far the main problem facing the UK economy. The likelihood remains that appreciable labour market slack and excess capacity will keep a lid on underlying price pressures. Certainly earnings growth currently remains very low.</p> <p>We strongly suspect that the Bank of England will deliver a further \u00a350bn of quantitative easing (QE) in the fourth quarter.</p> <h2>James Knightley, ING</h2> <p>The rise in oil prices and food commodities presents some risks for headline inflation in coming months, but with the weak economy implying only limited corporate pricing power we still expect inflation to fall back to 2% by the end of the year. This means that the Bank of England will have room to implement more QE at the November [meeting of the] MPC, especially with sterling strength causing some concern over export competitiveness at a time when domestic demand remains weak.</p> <h2>Ross Walker, RBS</h2> <p>The August inflation data provide some reassurance in the respect that, with some upside price influences in the pipeline (food, utility charges, petrol increases will filter in over the next few months, as well as some \"administered\" prices increases such as tuition fees) further inflation stickiness at this point would have been unhelpful and might have fuelled doubts about the BoE's ability to pursue further QE purchases.</p>",

Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics July's core inflation rate had been boosted by the earlier than usual end to high street sales and a sharp Olympics-related rise in air fares inflation, so a drop back in August had always looked likely. Admittedly, the recent increase in oil prices has meant that inflation is falling at a somewhat slower pace than seemed likely a few months ago. Nonetheless, oil prices have levelled off in recent weeks. What's more, inflation should drop to a greater extent in September \u2013 perhaps to 2% \u2013 as we reach the anniversary of last year's utility price hikes. Meanwhile, the weak economy should push core price pressures down further, keeping inflation low next year. As a result, we doubt that the outlook for inflation will dissuade the monetary policy committee (MPC) from announcing more asset purchases later this year. Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight The easing back in consumer price inflation in August supports belief that the Bank of England will enact further stimulus to help the economy in the fourth quarter, despite some recent improved news on economic activity. Although there is a risk that inflation will be sticky over the coming months, and despite some recent improved data and surveys, extended weak economic activity rather than inflation remains by far the main problem facing the UK economy. The likelihood remains that appreciable labour market slack and excess capacity will keep a lid on underlying price pressures. Certainly earnings growth currently remains very low. We strongly suspect that the Bank of England will deliver a further \u00a350bn of quantitative easing (QE) in the fourth quarter. James Knightley, ING The rise in oil prices and food commodities presents some risks for headline inflation in coming months, but with the weak economy implying only limited corporate pricing power we still expect inflation to fall back to 2% by the end of the year. This means that the Bank of England will have room to implement more QE at the November [meeting of the] MPC, especially with sterling strength causing some concern over export competitiveness at a time when domestic demand remains weak. Ross Walker, RBS The August inflation data provide some reassurance in the respect that, with some upside price influences in the pipeline (food, utility charges, petrol increases will filter in over the next few months, as well as some \"administered\" prices increases such as tuition fees) further inflation stickiness at this point would have been unhelpful and might have fuelled doubts about the BoE's ability to pursue further QE purchases.",

      "bodyText": "Profits at JD Sports plunged in the first half of the year, hit by \u00a310m-worth of losses from Blacks, which it took out of administration in January. The company, which paid \u00a320m for Blacks, said the outdoor chain was in a dire condition when it got the keys from the administrators, with a \"critical lack of stock and unsustainable cost base\". JD is best known for the eponymous sportswear chain that targets 18 to 24-year-olds with fashionable brands such as Adidas Originals, Converse and Fred Perry. Like-for-like sales in its core retail business ticked up 1.1% in the first half. The company's executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said: \"As ever, the group result for the full-year remains very dependent on the sales and margin performance in December and January.\" Despite pressures on margin and rising taxes and other levies across Europe, he said full-year profit before tax should come within expectations of \u00a365-\u00a370m. That will take a monumental effort in the second half, as first-half pre-tax profits came in at just \u00a32.9m, tumbling from \u00a320.1m in the first half of last year. Revenues, meanwhile, rose 26% to \u00a3556m. Recent trading has been mixed with like-for-like sales in the sports shops up 3.2% in the six weeks to September, while like-for-like sales at JD's fashion stores dropped 6%. The company said the vast majority of losses at Blacks fell in the first three months of ownership and that business was stabilising. Stores are fully restocked, it said, and it continues with its programme of reorganising central costs. Cowgill expects Blacks to break even in the second half, before any restructuring costs. Elsewhere in retail, Debenhams said like-for-like sales rose 1.6% (excluding VAT) this year, despite \"extremely challenging market conditions\". In a trading update ahead of its full-year results, the store said pre-tax profits in the year to September should beat last year's total of \u00a3160m. The Debenhams chief executive, Michael Sharp, said: \"To deliver like-for-like sales growth in these extremely challenging market conditions is highly creditable.\" He said he did not expect a significant change in the economic environment in the near future.",
