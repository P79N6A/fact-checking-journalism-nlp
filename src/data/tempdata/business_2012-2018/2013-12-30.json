Tucker, who quit the Bank of England this year after losing out on the top job to Canadian Mark Carney, was hauled before the Treasury select committee last year to answer claims that he encouraged Barclays to manipulate rates. Tucker emphatically denied the accusation. Bob Diamond, the former boss of Barclays, said Tucker had told him: \"It did not always need to be the case that we [Barclays] appeared as high [with Libor submissions] as we have recently.\" Three official reports cleared Tucker of wrongdoing. Until the Libor scandal broke, Tucker had been seen as the runaway favourite to replace Lord King as governor.

Tucker was educated at Codsall High School, a comprehensive near Wolverhampton. He joined the Bank in 1980, soon after graduating with a degree in maths and philosophy from Trinity College, Cambridge. His award is for services to central banking. Among the other City figures to receive knighthoods are Alan Parker, the founder and chairman of PR and lobbying firm Brunswick, and Ian Cheshire, chief executive of B&amp;Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher. Parker, a close friend of David Cameron who has holidayed with the prime minister, is one of the best-connected people in Britain and lobbies the government on behalf of about a quarter of the FTSE 100 list of Britain's biggest companies. Cameron and Gordon Brown were guests at his wedding to political lobbyist Jane Hardman in 2007. The prime minister is also close to Cheshire and appointed him to a taskforce of advisers to fight EU red tape. Cheshire, 54, collected \u00a32.6m in pay from Kingfisher last year.

      "bodyText": "Greece will leave its bailout programme next year without needing a third aid package, the country's prime minister, Antonis Samaras, announced on Monday, as he insisted that citizens could look to 2014 with confidence. Samaras told long-suffering Greeks that the end of the country's financial assistance plan was in sight after almost four years of painful austerity, and that the new year would bring the prospect of normality. \"In 2014 we will make the big step of exiting the loan agreement,\" Samaras said in a nationally televised address. \"In 2014, Greece will venture out to the markets again [and] start becoming a normal country\u2026 There will be no need for new loans and new bailout agreements\" Ireland left its bailout programme earlier this month, but a Greek exit would be a major milestone in the financial crisis that began to grip the eurozone in the spring of 2010. Greece has already received two aid packages, with around \u20ac130bn (\u00a3109bn) wiped off its debt in 2012. Greece is expected to finally leave recession in 2014, and investor confidence in the country has grown through the last year. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year bonds has fallen to around 8% \u2013 compared with 30% at the peak of the crisis \u2013 as traders regained faith that the debt would be repaid. Greek government bonds were one of the best-performing assets in 2013, returning 47%. Analysts, however, are sceptical of the claim that Greece will not need further aid next year. It has still not reached agreement with its international lenders over the size of its fiscal shortfall in next year's budget, with troika officials pushing Athens to make further painful cutbacks. Samaras was elected 18 months ago, and much of his time in office has been dominated by public anger created by the unpopular austerity measures demanded in return for the country's loans. Political instability has been a constant threat, with his majority now whittled down to 153 of the 300 seats in parliament. Record unemployment and pay cuts have pushed prices down across the country, and this punishing \"internal devaluation\" may continue in next year. \"In Greece, marked deflation has been evident since March and is likely to continue for some time to come,\" predicted Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Samaras was speaking just two days before Greece assumes the rotating presidency of the EU. There has been concern that Athens' six-month stint could be overshadowed by further bailout negotiations. Zsolt Darvas, an economist and senior fellow at the Bruegel Institute in Brussels, has predicted that the Greek presidency could be a rough ride: \"It will be very difficult for Greece due to its [internal] problems, its public administration inefficiency and the time pressure imposed by the European parliament elections,\" Darvas told AFP.",

    "webTitle": "Japan's Nikkei beats Dow Jones and FTSE 100 with 57% rise in 2013", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A turnaround in Japan's economic fortunes over the last year has given the Nikkei index of leading shares its biggest annual rise since 1972. The Dow Jones was trading at a record level of 16,483 on Monday and the FTSE 100 has staged a recovery from an autumn slowdown, but neither can match the 57% gain in the Tokyo market since January. Japanese exports are up and much of the industrial sector has returned to health. Industrial giants such as Sony, Panasonic and Sharp have seen a turnaround in sales after several years of heavy losses. Adding to the generally upbeat tone, many employers have put the brakes on redundancies and begun opening factories again. The mood in Tokyo is cautious, but after more than 20 years of torpor, Japan is once more a hive of activity. The government elected in 2012, led by prime minister Shinzo Abe, has proved to be a catalyst, injecting life into a debt-ridden economy many had written off as moribund. The newfound economic success has emboldened Abe in the political sphere. He has challenged China over the disputed Senkaku islands (known as the Diaoyu islands in China) and talked about reviving Japan's military machine. In the aftermath of the Philippines hurricane disaster, Abe pledged aid worth five times the total committed by China. At the heart of Tokyo's recent success is a 40% fall in the yen's value against the dollar, which has made exports cheaper and brought with it a much needed boost to import prices and consequently inflation. The yen began falling within weeks of Abe's election and his promise to mimic the loose monetary policies adopted by the US and Britain. To push through reforms, he appointed a new central bank boss who threw off the conservative garb of his predecessors. Most importantly from Abe's standpoint, Haruhiko Kuroda embraced quantitative easing (QE). As in the west, the Tokyo version of QE involved printing billions in extra currency to offset the weakness of banks and over-indebted households following the financial crash of 2008. Printing extra yen was a signal to investors to sell their government bonds, further devaluing the currency. A fall in the yen also brought with it higher inflation, which was another key aim of the Abe administration. While it may seem counterintuitive to want higher inflation, Tokyo desperately needed a sustained and steady rise in prices to encourage consumption at home. After more than two decades of falling prices, consumers were accustomed to goods being cheaper next year and thus put off buying decisions. Inflation encourages expenditure now. In a speech earlier this month, Kuroda said: \"For the Japanese economy, now is a golden opportunity to break away from deflation, as signs of a favourable turn are being widely observed in the real economy, in the financial market and in people's minds and expectations. The Bank of Japan promises to achieve the price stability target of 2% as early as possible.\" Takuji Aida, Japan analyst at the investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \"The implications of using the expressions 'golden opportunity' and 'as early as possible' are strong, and it seems more likely that the Bank of Japan will use the logic of launching additional QE to make the realisation of its view more certain, even if the economic outlook and prices are progressing in line with the central bank's assumptions.\" But there are several question marks over how long the latest Japanese miracle can be sustained. Analysts are concerned that the recovery depends on a currency value that could climb when success appears assured and investors come racing back. Without a low currency, the nascent export boom will come to an abrupt end, they argue, and politicians will face mounting problems stemming from a declining population and a lack of energy self-sufficiency now that almost all the country's nuclear reactors have been decommissioned. The yen is likely to remain low while the Bank of Japan keeps the printing presses rolling and the US and UK keep QE on hold. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve cut its monthly QE programme from $85bn to $75bn (\u00a352bn to \u00a346bn) and it is likely to mothball the printing presses later in 2014. The Bank of England has already signalled that a rise in QE is unlikely without another crisis to resolve. There is also a question mark hanging over companies such as Sony and Panasonic, which ruled the electronics era of the 1980s and 90s, but have lost ground to Apple of the US and Samsung of Korea in the digital age. Officials in the Abe administration believe the boost to lending through QE, and the knock-on effect of a lower currency and a return to moderate inflation, have bought much-needed time for corporate Japan to challenge the US in the digital race and leave China to be the low-end workshop of the world. But some fear cheap money could dissuade firms, still overburdened with \"jobs for life\" workers, from investing and innovating to keep pace with rivals.",

      "bodyText": "From the Cyprus crisis to coked-up bankers, the horsemeat scandal and the sad death of a young German student, it was another dramatic year in the business world. Based on the number of visits to each page, here are theguardian.com/uk/business top 10 stories of 2013. 1. Aldi confirms up to 100% horsemeat in beef products At 1.8m page views \u2013 and counting \u2013 the story on Aldi confirming some of its products contained 100% horsemeat was by far the most popular story on the business site this year. But it had a strange journey to the top of the charts, producing only modest numbers on its launch in early February. Seven months later, however, there was a sudden and extreme spike in traffic, generating 300,000 page views in just three days in early September. Its traffic continues to spike, although at a less extreme rate, regularly pushing the story into our daily \"most read\" list, 10 months after it was first launched, and further boosting traffic. The trigger for the September spike may have been this story on Tesco being rapped for implying the horsemeat scandal affected the whole food industry. This was followed by huge referral for the original story from Facebook \u2013 it has been shared almost 230,000 times to date \u2013 possibly by people not realising it was an old story. 2. Bank of America intern's death puts banks' working culture in spotlight The tragic death of a young intern working in the London office of Bank of America Merrill Lynch triggered calls for an enquiry into excessive working hours in the City. Moritz Erhardt, a 21 year old German student, was found dead in the shower after having regularly worked through the night at the bank. An inquest later found that he died as a result of an epileptic seizure, but heard that fatigue could have been a trigger. 3. Cyprus bailout: last-ditch deal agreed \u2013 as it happened The Cyprus crisis shook world stock markets and threatened to trigger fresh turmoil in the battered eurozone. Five of our top 10 stories in 2013 were on Cyprus, charting the fear and chaos that led to the controversial bailout on 25 March. The progress of the rescue deal was dramatically recorded by Graeme Wearden, aided by Ben Quinn, in a marathon live blog that began on the morning of 24 March and ended in the early hours of the following day. 4. Cyprus crisis: MPs approve bank restructuring and solidarity fund \u2013 as it happened The fate of Cyprus hung in the balance as the clock ticked towards the Monday deadline set by the European Central Bank. Britain dispatched a task force of top civil servants to advise the stricken island on how to pull its banking system back from the brink of collapse. 5. Cyprus races to rework savings tax after closing banks till Thursday - as it happened Banks in Cyprus shut their doors to head off a run on deposits amid confusion created by the controversial bailout proposals and levy on bank accounts. There was widespread anger at the decision to tax savers and hundreds of protestors marched carrying anti-government banners. A scheduled vote in parliament was cancelled when it became clear the government could not win. 6. Eurozone crisis live: Cyprus crisis deepens as MPs reject bailout terms The Cyprus crisis deepened as MPs rejected the controversial plan to skim \u20ac5.8bn from savers' bank accounts, in a move that risked plunging the eurozone into a fresh crisis and heightened expectations that the cash-strapped nation would seek a funding lifeline from Russia. Cyprus had just 24 hours to find a solution to its funding gap before its banks were due to reopen. 7. Cyprus bailout crisis shakes markets The euro dived and shares suffered sharp losses after the controversial bailout package for Cyprus threatened fresh turmoil in the eurozone. Eurozone finance ministers demanded that Cypriots pay up to 10% of their bank deposits in exchange for a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.5bn) bailout, prompting panic across the island as people rushed to cash machines to withdraw their savings. 8. Sports Direct: 90% of staff on zero-hour contracts Simon Neville's revelation that the entire 20,000 part-time workforce of Sports Direct were employed on zero-hour contracts sparked outrage, particularly as 2,000 full-time staff were about to cash in bonuses of up to \u00a3100,000. In the following weeks, numerous other companies were shown to be widespread users of the controversial contracts, which leave employees not knowing how many hours they will work from one week to the next, often with no sick pay or holiday pay, and no guarantee of regular work. 9. Did cocaine use by bankers cause the global financial crisis? Did coked-up bankers cause the credit crunch? Former City analyst and author Geraint Anderson, who \"certainly saw my fair share of sniffly noses and gurning jaws at City bars every Thursday night,\" believes they did. \"Greed, selfishness, ignorance and ruthlessness also played their part, of course, but I think it would be foolish not to see the role that the drug played in creating the bubble.\" 10. British sugar giant caught in global tax scandal One of Britain's biggest multinationals, whose brands include Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings Tea and Kingsmill bread, avoided paying millions of pounds of tax in an African state blighted by malnutrition, according to a report published by ActionAid.

Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest data from the <strong><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/hew/2013/Sep/default.aspx\">Bank of England</a></strong> showed Britons continued to pay off their mortgages in the third quarter, as heightened caution persisted.</p> <p>There was a net injection of housing equity of \u00a310.4bn over the period, as people strive to get their household balance sheets in order amid high debt levels.</p> <p>It is a continuation of a trend which began when the financial crisis hit in 2008, and marked the 22nd consecutive quarter of net housing equity injection.

      "bodyText": "Signed contracts to buy existing homes in the US rose by 0.2% in November, ending five months of falls but below expectations of a 1% rise. Despite the modest monthly rise pending home sales were still 1.6% lower than they were in November 2012 according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, said overall the figures were positive: We may have reached a cyclical low because the positive fundamentals of job creation and household formation are likely to foster a fairly stable level of contract activity in 2014. Although the final months of 2013 are finishing on a soft note, the year as a whole will end with the best sales total in seven years. And with that, it's time to end the blog for today. Thank you for all your comments. We'll be back tomorrow morning with coverage of all the main events, including the guest editorship of BBC Radio 4's Today programme by Barclays' boss Antony Jenkins. Across the Atlantic US markets are also roughly flat, as traders await the latest homes sales data. Dow Jones: +0.07 at 16,490.51 S&amp;P 500: 0.00% at 1,841.38 Nasdaq: -0.08% at 4,153.33 The modestly positive sentiment in early trading has slipped away, albeit on a day of thin trading volumes, leaving markets roughly flat.

It made an annual gain of 26%, slightly below its 29% rise in 2012. Environment secretary Owen Paterson said that some power companies \"let their customers down badly\" over Christmas, when thousands of homes were left without power for several days when storms hit. At the height of the storms more than 150,000 properties were cut off, with the south east the worst hit region. Paterson told the BBC: Quite clearly some of the power companies let their customers down badly. It seems obvious at this stage that they let too many of their staff go away for the Christmas holiday, they didn't have enough people manning the call centres and that wasn't acceptable. He said power suppliers should have been better prepared because the Environment Agency gave plenty of warning about the severe weather in the run up to Christmas. In separate comments made to ITV, Paterson said he had told power companies they would be expected to limit staff holidays over the new year period: I think some of them [energy companies] definitely let their customers down, and I'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power. Some of the companies have performed, some have not, and I think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers. It's up to them to compensate their customers. We've had two Cobra [the government's emergency committee] meetings over the last couple of days and we've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures \u2013 not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week. Read our full story on his comments here. The improved global economic outlook and rising risk appetite has put gold on course for its biggest annual price fall in more than three decades. A decline in 2013 would bring to an end 12 successive years of growth. The decision by the US Federal Reserve to slow its bond buying programme, combined with a better global outlook, have weighed on the non-yielding asset that costs to store. Spot gold was down 0.8% at $1,202.54 an ounce on Monday, while US gold futures for February delivery fell $11.60 to $1,202.40. It may be a quiet day on the corporate front but there are still deals to be done. Rosneft, Russia's number one crude producer said it had agreed to sell up to 3.2m tonnes of oil products to BP, for up to $2.87bn. Rosneft's board has also approved the sale of up to 1.3m tonnes of gas oil to BP for up to $1.2bn. BP owns around 20% of the Russian state-controlled company. The latest data from the Bank of England showed Britons continued to pay off their mortgages in the third quarter, as heightened caution persisted. There was a net injection of housing equity of \u00a310.4bn over the period, as people strive to get their household balance sheets in order amid high debt levels. It is a continuation of a trend which began when the financial crisis hit in 2008, and marked the 22nd consecutive quarter of net housing equity injection. Between 1997 and 2008, housing equity withdrawal was the norm as households were keener to spend than pay off their mortgages. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the cautious mood among UK households might be waning slightly. The Q3 figure was less than the \u00a312.5bn reported for Q2, and the lowest since the first quarter of 2010. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said Britons were likely to continue to pay off their mortgages while interest rates remain low: Markedly rising house prices and overall improved consumer confidence may increasingly lead to some people engaging in housing equity withdrawal going forward. However, very low mortgage interest rates, the fact that house prices in some regions remain below their 2007 peak levels and an ongoing need for many people to improve their personal finances suggests that there will continue to be a significant net injection of housing equity for some time to come. There is certainly a compelling case for many people to be looking to take advantage of current extended low mortgage interest rates to reduce their outstanding mortgage levels to improve their balance sheets \u2013 if they can afford to do so. Extremely low savings interest rates have undeniably made it much more attractive for many people to use any spare funds that they have to reduce their mortgages. In particular, many people may be using the extra money that is resulting from their very low mortgage interest payments to reduce the balance that they still owe on their houses. Also with house prices soft until early-2013, housing equity withdrawal was markedly less attractive. Sentiment among Italian manufacturers improved at a slower rate than expected in December. The manufacturing confidence index from ISTAT, Italy's statistics institute, rose to 98.2. lower than the 98.9 forecast by economists. Despite the weaker than expected figure, it marked the eighth consecutive monthly rise in manufacturers' confidence, and the highest level since August 2011. November's index was nudged down to 98 from 98.1. ISTAT's composite index, combining data from the manufacturing, services, retail and construction sectors, rose for a second month to 83.6 from 83.4. Britain's \"voice of business\" has told companies that are doing well to pay workers more in the year ahead. John Cridland, the CBI's director general, said those businesses benefiting from economic recovery should press ahead with pay rises, criticising those he accused of keeping \"far too many people stuck in minimum-wage jobs\". Cridland set out his argument in an unusually forthright annual New Year message to business leaders: The recovery is taking root and business leaders have a spring in their step compared to this time last year \u2013 but this is no time to rest on our laurels. Businesses must support employees in every part of the country to move up the career ladder, while also giving a helping hand to young people taking their first tentative steps into the world of work. As the financial situation of many firms begins to turn a corner, one of the biggest challenges facing businesses is to deliver growth that will mean better pay and more opportunities for all their employees after a prolonged squeeze. The good news is that wages will pick up in the year ahead as growth beds down and productivity improves. But there are still far too many people stuck in minimum-wage jobs without routes to progression \u2013 and that\u2019s a serious challenge that businesses and the Government must address. Read our full story here. At least four shots hit the residence of the German ambassador in Athens, according to police reports in Greece. It is thought no one was hurt in the early morning incident, and the identity of the attackers is unclear. The shots were fired at the metal gate surrounding the high security residence, which is located on a busy street in the Greek capital. Sixty spent bullet cases were collected according to Reuters, which had this to say: Anti-German sentiment has grown during Greece's prolonged economic crisis, and many of those struggling with record unemployment and plummeting living standards blame Germany's insistence on fiscal rigor for their economic woes. Germany is the biggest single contributing nation to Greece's 240-billion euro bailouts which have kept the country afloat since 2010 and saved it from bankruptcy. The German ambassador's residence was the target of an attack in 1999, when members of the now dismantled extremist group November 17 fired a rocket-propelled grenade that hit its roof. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras spoke to the German ambassador Wolfgang Dold, who was at home at the time of the incident, and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos expressed his \"outrage and outright condemnation\" over the attack. It was a \"cowardly terrorist act clearly targeting Greece's image abroad a few days before the start of the Greek presidency,\" Venizelos said, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry. Europe's major indices are largely in positive territory this morning, following the Nikkei's rise in Japan. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,757.38 CAC 40: +0.21% at 4,286.71 DAX 30: +0.01% at 9,589.88 IBEX: +0.18% 9,917.6 FTSE MIB: -0.05% at 18,947.23 Over in Italy, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is bracing itself for potential nationalisation, after its shareholders rejected vital fundraising plans. The decision to reject a \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.5bn) share sale has plunged the future of the world's oldest bank into deeper uncertainty, after it turned to the state for a \u20ac4.1bn bailout earlier this year. The Italian government will be keen to avoid nationalising the bank, and according to reports the Treasury is encouraging all parties to reach an alternative solution. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.7% at 16,291.31 on Monday, the final day of trading in 2013. The index rose 57% over the year as a whole - the strongest gain since 1972 - following the massive economic stimulus pumped into the system by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The yen meanwhile fell to a five year low against the dollar, which hit 105.415 yen. The Nikkei's performance on Monday also marked the longest winning streak since July 2009. The Nikkei could be in for further gains in 2014 according to some commentators. It is worth noting the Nikkei is still sharply lower than its all-time high of just below 39,000, reached on 29 December 1989.",

The company now expects fourth-quarter revenue to be at the low end of the previously provided outlook range of $220m-$225m, while it expects loss per share to be near 23 cents (14p).",

      "bodyText": "Gales have battered Britain over the past month and householders are still mopping up from the floods that swept parts of Kent and Surrey. Yet 2013 has turned out to be one of the quietest years on record for home insurers, with claims down by nearly a quarter compared to 2012. Experts are now predicting that home insurance premiums are likely to fall by around 5% in the new year, cutting around \u00a312.50 off the typical \u00a3250 cost of building and contents cover for the average UK home. There were 1.2m claims on home insurance policies in the first nine months of 2013, a fall of 23% on the 1.5m claims in the same period of 2012, according to an analysis of Association of British Insurers figures by accountants Deloitte. The fall in claims \u2013 which means insurers have enjoyed one of their best years since 1994 \u2013 comes despite the big freeze at the start of the year. Snow blanketed Britain in mid-January, while March saw record low temperatures in many parts of the country, in the coldest winter since 1962. But despite the extreme weather conditions, and the recent gales and floods, the number of claims has been relatively low. Recent flooding in areas such as Yalding in Kent has affected around 1,300 homes, but the scale of damage is far less than the 2007 floods that hit Tewkesbury and other parts of Gloucestershire or the 2009 devastation of Cockermouth in Cumbria. James Rakow, insurance partner at Deloitte, said: \"The weather in the first nine months of 2013 has been benign with relatively few storms and floods. Although bad weather swept across the country over Christmas, the numbers of claims are unlikely to significantly affect home insurers' results. If there are no major floods or storms in the first few months of 2014, it is quite feasible that premiums could fall by at least 5%.\" But car insurers are braced for a surge in claims after storms and heavy winds on the night of 23 December caused chaos on Britain's roads ahead of the Christmas getaway. The AA said that on Christmas Eve it rescued 603 cars deep in floodwater, often after motorists failed to heed warnings. Darron Burness, head of special operations at the AA, said: \"Our teams rescued drivers who attempted to drive through deep flood water and come to grief, in some cases having ignored 'road closed' warnings. \"Don't think that if you have a 4x4 you are immune from becoming stranded. We had to pull a number of vehicles that have so-called 'off road' capability out of water. Floods don't count as 'off road' terrain.\"",
