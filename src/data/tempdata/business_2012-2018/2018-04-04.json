After investors fled equities in the morning due to proposed retaliatory tariffs from China, their concerns about a potential trade war eased by the afternoon after Trump\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in a \u201cnegotiation\u201d with China rather than a trade war. Investors said they were comforted by the fact that any tariffs would not take effect immediately, if at all. Strategists also cited the S&amp;P\u2019s bounce above a key technical support level and said they expect equities to rise further around the first quarter earnings season, due to start in mid-April. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to feel that while markets hate uncertainty, Trump\u2019s bark is worse than his bite when it comes to trade,\u201d said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. In a surprise twist, shares have surged back in New York. The Dow has closed up 230 points, bouncing back from its early slump. Why? Well, markets are mysterious and sometimes random things, but Larry Kudlow can take some credit after his efforts telling investors not to panic. Paul Krugman, the Nobel-prize wining economist (and trade expert) has written an article for the New York Times, outlining why a trade war would be highly disruptive. Here\u2019s a flavour: Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u2013 on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u2019m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u2019t (yet) exist. Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u2013 and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u201cChina shock\u201d paper by Autor et al wasn\u2019t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital. Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month. In a note to clients, they say: The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u2019s semi-annual currency report, due out this month. As a candidate, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator \u201con day one\u201d but so far has resisted. In and of itself, that would not trigger any action, but it would be a signal that the trade spat is escalating. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the US/China trade spat, for anyone just tuning in: China has raised the stakes in the escalating trade showdown with the United States by unveiling tariffs on a wide-ranging list of American imports in response to levies on Chinese goods put forward by Donald Trump. Beijing will impose additional tariffs of 25% on 106 American products from 14 separate categories, including soybean, cars and chemical products, covering imports to China worth up to $50bn (\u00a336bn), Chinese state news agencies said on Wednesday. The measures come after the US announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China drawn up by the Trump administration. The list of more than 1,300 products targets China\u2019s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. Washington said the levies were in response to China\u2019s \u201cunfair trade practices related to the forced transfer of US technology and intellectual property,\u201d adding that the list of products had been designed to target China\u2019s industrial plans while minimising the impact on the US economy. The array of Chinese products that would be affected is lengthy and varied, covering everything from aircraft jets and tyres, to uranium and nuclear reactor parts, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and guns and ammunition. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, jukeboxes and cassette players. The proposed list will undergo a public review process before trade officials ultimately decide which products should be hit by tariffs. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the country would only implement its tariffs on American goods once the US government imposed levies on imports from China. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are on the list of products targeted by Beijing, along with some trucks and SUVs. The inclusion of agricultural and food and drink products such as soybeans, whisky, beef, corn and wheat is likely to raise eyebrows for targeting southern American states where Trump drew much of his support while running for the presidency. We\u2019ve also pulled together a full list of the products which could be landed with new tariffs: Wall Street is looking calmer now, but I\u2019ll be back with any major developments.... Other countries could benefit if China hits US exporters with new tariffs. As Dutch financial group bank Rabobank puts it: There aren\u2019t enough soybeans in the world to meet China\u2019s demands without US supplies. They suspect that farmers in Australia and Brazil might benefit, at the expense of US farmers, if American agricultural products become uncompetitively priced in China. European stock markets have closed for the night, with trade jitters weighing on shares. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the biggest companies across Europe, has lost 0.5% today, with losses in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Britain\u2019s market did a little better, though, with the FTSE 100 finishing 3 points higher (up a meagre 0.05%). Here\u2019s a transcript of Larry Kudlow, the US National Economic Council Director, telling Fox Business why a trade war won\u2019t break out between the US and China. \u201cAbsolutely not. Absolutely not. And let me just say right at the top, number one, blame China, not President Trump. Because they\u2019ve been going on for many years. Trump is really the first president to fight back and to put a shot across the bow, stealing intellectual property rights, technology transfers, high barriers, investment limitations, high tariffs \u2013 this stuff really is not just unfair, it\u2019s unlawful. It\u2019s outside the boundaries of the WTO. Every country in the world knows this. Every analyst knows this is the case. Somebody\u2019s got to deal with it. President Trump is going to deal with it. There\u2019s no trade war here. What you\u2019ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There\u2019s already backchannel talks going on. So look, I understand the stock market\u2019s anxiety. I get that. But on the other hand, don\u2019t over react. We\u2019ll see how this works out. My view Stu, look, you know I\u2019m a growth guy, I\u2019m a Reagan supply side growth guy. I think that at the end of this whole process, that at the end of the rainbow, there\u2019s a pot of gold. And if you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Anytime you lower barriers, anytime you lower barriers, and that\u2019s the key, the president will say this, lower barriers is the key, don\u2019t raise the barriers. Anytime you do that, it\u2019s good for growth. It\u2019s good for American growth and American workers, it\u2019s good for China\u2019s growth, it\u2019s good for the rest of the world\u2019s growth.\u201d It\u2019s been a volatile morning on the New York stock exchange, as traders saw shares slide sharply at the open before recovering some ground... Jonathan Butcher, principal economist at consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, reckons a full-blown trade clash between America and China would hurt global growth badly. He says the mere risk of trade disputes will make people reluctant to spend, and discourage firms from investing in new equipment and factories. \u201cThe risk of a trade war developing is a threat to the global economy. We are currently enjoying a period of robust global growth, but sentiment plays a big part in maintaining economic momentum. The threat of a trade war could dampen sentiment, slowing consumer spending and business investment. Should a trade war escalate between the US and China, Wood Mackenzie estimates that global economic growth could slow from 2.9% to 2.2% over the next 4 years.\u201d Wall Street is clawing its way back from its early slump. The Dow is still in the red, but only by 150 points (-0.6%) while the Nasdaq is only 0.5% lower lower. Traders may be heeding the soothing words of economics advisor Larry Kudlow, and reassessing the risks of a trade war. They\u2019ve also received some decent economic news today. US companies created 241,000 private sector jobs last month, more than expected. That indicates the labor market is still strong, and could mean a strong Non-Farm Payroll jobs report on Friday. Commodity prices are still suffering, though; the soybean future contract is down almost 3%. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s new top economic advisor, has embarked on a mission to calm the markets. Speaking to reporters on the White House driveway, Kudlow insisted that America wasn\u2019t about to lose a trade war with China. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t see it that way. This is a negotiation, using all the tools\u201d Kudlow has also popped up on Fox Business, to tell the markets not to panic. He claims that the Trump administration\u2019s goal is to get rid of trade barriers, and create a genuine level-playing field of free and fair trade. As Kudlow puts it: I think that at the end of this whole process, the end of the rainbow, there is a pot of gold. If you open up that pot, you will see better economic growth, more trading going on, improved wages for both sides. Any time you lower barriers....it\u2019s good for growth. It\u2019s good for American growth and American workers. It\u2019s good for China\u2019s growth. It\u2019s good for the rest of the world\u2019s growth. The US president has tweeted again: $500bn is a nice round number, but officially the US only ran a trade in goods deficit of $375.2bn with China last year. Any farmer planning to sell his soybean crop may not agree either...... Today\u2019s selloff means the Dow is now 11% off its record high, leaving it in correction territory. That record high, of 26,616 points, was set on Friday 26th January - the day Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum, and boasted that the US stock market was up 50% since he won the election. It\u2019s never been higher since.... This is turning into a broad-based rout. Each of the 30 blue-chip companies which makes up the Dow has fallen into the red. Chemicals maker DowDuPont has lost 2.8%, Intel has lost 2.5%, General Electric and Goldman Sachs is down 2%. Every sector of the S&amp;P 500 has also fallen. Boeing is also being hit hard. Its shares are down over 4% in early trading. Bloomberg explains why China\u2019s new 25% tariffs could be bad news for the airline maker: In a tit-for-tat response to tariffs from Trump, China announced the planned levy on aircraft weighing between 15,000 kilograms (33,000 pounds) and 45,000 kilograms, which would include some variants of Boeing\u2019s 737 family of passenger jets. Single-aisle jets, dominated by the 737 and Airbus\u2019s A320 family, both with sticker prices of about $100 million, are likely to account for three quarters of the global market over the next two decades, according to Boeing\u2019s estimates. Shares in automobile manufacturers are falling in New York, following the news that China is proposing a 25% tariff on imports of some US cars. Fiat Chrysler is down 2.6%, electric carmaker Tesla has lost 3.7%, and Ford has dipped by 1.5%. The opening bell of the New York stock market is ringing, and shares are taking a bath. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 480 points at the start of trading, as 2% was swiftly wiped off the benchmark index. The S&amp;P 500 index (which includes more companies than the Dow) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index are also sliding, as investors express their anxiety over the tit-for-tat trade clashes between China and the US. Details to follow.... Just time for a quick peek at the European markets...and they\u2019re all in the red, as trade war fears bite. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says investors have been \u201cdeeply disturbed by the speed and extent of China\u2019s response\u201d to America\u2019s tariffs. Tin hats on... Traders in New York are getting ready for a rough open to the trading session, in just over 10 minutes. The Dow Jones is currently on track to fall by almost 550 points, according to the futures markets, as Wall Street gives its verdict on the latest US-China tariffs. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says trade war fears are gripping the financial markets today. Investors are diving out of shares, and putting money into safe-haven assets like gold, he says: Dow futures have collapsed 500 points and other global indices were sharply lower at the time of writing after China retaliated overnight to a slate of trade measures launched by the US government hours earlier aimed at narrowing China\u2019s vast trade surplus with America. China said it will apply tariffs on 106 US-produced goods, ranging from aeroplanes to soya beans. While the escalation of trade wars have weighed heavily on commodity prices such as corn, soya beans, crude oil and copper, gold on the other hand has been able to climb higher thanks to its safe haven status. Gold is up 1% today, at $1,325 per ounce. Jared Bernstein, former economic advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, argues that America and China might not actually impose these tariffs for months, or indeed ever: Economist George Magnus, of Oxford University\u2019s China Centre, believes these new tariffs are only a \u2018foothill\u2019 in the history of trade wars. But the situation could become a lot worse, he told Bloomberg TV, if the two sides announce further tariffs. Potentially, almost all US exports to China could face new tariffs, which would hurt both country\u2019s economies. He\u2019s tweeted about this fear: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, points out there is time for America and China to step back from their new tariffs: \u201cThe important thing to note about the current spat between China and the US is that the US has built a timescale for negotiation into their plans. Seven weeks of consultation with the public will follow before US tariffs bite. The Chinese announcement today was to make sure agricultural and aeronautic businesses and workers have the longest time possible to lobby for a climbdown from this confrontation while they engage to find mutually beneficial ways of reducing the bilateral trade deficit\u201d. With an hour to go until the open, the Dow is expected to fall by around 2% - a fairly chunky decline. Here\u2019s more details of the Wilbur Ross interview: China\u2019s tariffs \u201camount to about three-tenths of a percent of our GDP. So, it\u2019s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u201d Ross said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s relatively proportionate to the tariffs we put on based on the intellectual property.\u201d Wilbur Ross, the US Commerce secretary, says we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that China has hit back today. He told CNBC it would have been \u201cextremely embarrassing\u201d for Beijing if it hadn\u2019t retaliated, and that markets shouldn\u2019t be too alarmed. Ross said: They are very good at arithmetic. They know we\u2019re talking about fractions of 1% of the respective economies. So, this is not World War 3. America is waking up to the news that China and the US have taken another step closer to a trade war that could hurt the global economy badly. A few hours ago, China announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on a swathe of US goods, worth $50bn last year. The list includes soybeans, cars and aircraft -- three key export areas. Beef, cigars and whiskey are all on the list too. Economists say the tariffs are tougher than expected. They would hit American exporters, such as farmers, hard, as Beijing puts the US agricultural sector in the firing line. China\u2019s deputy finance minister has insisted that China doesn\u2019t want a trade war, as it would be a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 situation. But Beijing has also made it clear that it won\u2019t back down. As its eEmbassy in Washington, put it: \u201cAs the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The retaliation came hours after America announced tariffs on over 1,300 Chinese products. The wide-ranging list covered machinery, electronics - even uranium and flamethrowers. The office of the US trade representative said the measures would target products that benefitted from China\u2019s theft of US intellectual property. President Trump has responded to Beijing\u2019s move - he tweeted that America lost its trade war with China many years ago, so must take new measures to close its trade deficit. Angel Gurria, Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, has called the latest developments \u2018very worrysome\u2019. He told an audience in London: You are talking about the number one and number two traders in the world,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not good for anyone, it\u2019s bad... It\u2019s a lose-lose situation.\u201d US Soybean Export Council has said it \u2018regrets\u2019 China\u2019s decision, warning that companies in the US and China will both suffer. Financial markets have reacted badly, with the price of soybeans tumbling by 5%. European stock markets have fallen into the red, and Wall Street is bracing for a sharp selloff in 90 minutes time. In the futures market, aircraft-maker Boeing are down 4%, and machinery giant Caterpillar has lost 3.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by over 500 points, or around 2%. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says investors fear that relations between Washington and Beijing could deteriorate further: Despite hopes of success in negotiations between the US and China last week, today\u2019s retaliation from China is likely to cement fears amongst analysts of a trade war. The tariffs represent the U.S.\u2019s most powerful challenge in decades to China\u2019s economic practices, with 25% tariffs unless Beijing makes major trade and investment concessions. China has announced retaliatory measures today, with 25% tariffs on US goods, leading the markets in Europe to slump this morning. The uncertainty in the markets over the heightening trade tensions also weighed on the oil markets. Traders will be bracing themselves for further volatility in the coming days.\u201d Newsflash: President Trump has declared that America has already lost the trade war with China: That\u2019s quite a change of position from Trump. Last month, he tweeted that trade wars were \u2018good, and easy to win\u2019 - for a country in America\u2019s position. Christopher Balding, associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, reckons China has a clear warning to America -- back down over trade, or else: Last year, the US-China Business Council issued a report explaining why exports to China were \u201cvital to US economic growth\u201d. They pointed out that China is America\u2019s third-largest goods export market (behind Canada and Mexico), while service exports swelled over 400% between 2006 and 2015. The report argued that trade with China supports a lot of US jobs: US goods exports to China come from a wide range of industries including transportation equipment, agriculture, computers and electronics, and chemicals. These exports also sustain logistics jobs in America\u2019s ports and throughout the country. US services exports to China included travel and education, royalties, transportation, business and professional services, and financial services. The Council also explains how States across America have a stake - and could thus suffer from a trade war: Most states have seen significant increases in exports of goods and services to China since 2006. Thirty states experienced at least triple-digit goods export growth to China since 2006, and four states saw growth of more than 500 percent over the same period: Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, and South Carolina. Every US state had triple-digit services export growth to China since 2006, 16 states had export growth of more than 400 percent. China is among the top five goods and services export markets for most states. China was a top three goods export market for 39 states in 2016, and among the top five for another eight states. That includes states that are not usually associated with strong China trade ties, including Alabama, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee Wendy Chen, an economist at Nomura, has told my colleague Lily Kuo that America and China can still avoid a trade war: \u201cWe think there is still room for negotiation between the two economies, although the risk of a full-blown trade war is rising,\u201d It\u2019s clear that the Chinese government isn\u2019t messing about with its new tariffs. By including aircraft, soybeans and cars, Beijing is targeting the three largest exports from America to China last year (according to the US Census Bureau). China has released a list of the 106 US products which will incur a new 25% tariff (unless Donald Trump backs down and abandons America\u2019s proposed tariffs on Chinese goods). The list includes: Yellow soybeans black soybeans other corn corn flour uncombed cotton durum wheat fresh and cold beef (whole head or half) fresh and cold beef with bones frozen boneless beef unstemmed tobacco tobacco cigars tobacco cigarettes cigar and cigarettes with tobacco substitute hookah materials frozen orange juice whiskey various types of cars and trucks aircrafts of more than 15000kg but less than 45000 kg weight Here\u2019s the full list China\u2019s deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, has blamed the US government for triggering the latest tit-for-tat tariffs. Shouwen told reporters in Beijing: \u201cIt must be said, we have been forced into taking this action. \u201cOur action is restrained.\u201d Wang was speaking alongside deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao, as he insisted that China didn\u2019t want a trade war. The future market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 600 points, or more than 2%. Such a sharp selloff would confirm that Beijing\u2019s retaliation is firmer than many investors expected (or hoped). Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, says the strength and scale of China\u2019s retaliation is somewhat unexpected: \u201cThe assumption was China would not respond too aggressively and avoid escalating tensions. China\u2019s response is a surprise for some people. Evans-Pritchard adds that the two sides could still avert a trade war: \u201cIt\u2019s more of a game of brinkmanship, making it clear what the cost would be, in the hopes that both sides can come to agreement and none of these tariffs will come into force.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that China hasn\u2019t said when these new tariffs on $50bn of US imports will come into effect. The Ministry of Finance says it depends when the $50bn of tariffs outlined by Donald Trump\u2019s administration last night are implemented. So, unless both sides back down, there will soon be 25% tariffs on $100bn of trade between the two countries: Shares in major American industry giants are expected to take a tumble when Wall Street opens at 2.30pm BST: The soybean selloff is deepening, as traders anticipate weaker demand for this crucial product. Corn and wheat are also being hit by worries of a trade war between China and the US: Back in Beijing, deputy finance minister Zhu Guangyao says China will not give in to pressure for America over intellectual property rights. Reuters has more details: External pressure will instead promote China\u2019s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing. Friction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides. China\u2019s retaliation is more forceful than the financial markets had expected, says Gao Qi, Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. That explains why shares fell immediately in Europe, with Wall Street on track for losses too. He told Bloomberg: \u201cChina\u2019s response was tougher than what the market was expecting -- investors didn\u2019t foresee the country levying additional tariffs on sensitive and important products such as soybeans and airplanes. \u201cInvestors believe a trade war will hurt both countries and their economies eventually.\u201d China\u2019s decision to slap a 25% tariff on soybean imports from America looks like a real shot over the bows of the Trump administration. Soybeans are a crucial part of the global food chain, used as a source of oil and also to feed livestock such as pigs and chicken. The World Wildlife Fund calls it the \u2018king of beans\u2019, saying: It contains 38% protein \u2014 2x as much as pork, 3x more than eggs, and 12x more than milk. Also the protein in soybean has a more complete range of essential amino acids than most other foods. It\u2019s also used in vegetarian food products like tofu (which comes from soy milk). China is the world\u2019s largest import of soybeans; American farms sold around $14bn of soybeans to China companies last year. So farmers in America\u2019s agricultural belt - which is typically Republican-supporting - may have deep concerns about the tit-for-tat tariffs. NBC\u2019s Janis Mackey Frayer says China had this in mind when it drew up today\u2019s tariffs... Soybean tariffs could also hurt Chinese farmers - pushing up their import prices and making pork more expensive. China\u2019s foreign ministry has urged the US to abandon its plan to impose tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products. At a daily press briefing, the ministry said the two countries should resolve trade differences through dialogue. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, says: \u201cThose who attempt to make China surrender through pressure or intimidation have never succeeded before, and will not succeed now. China\u2019s deputy finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, is holding a press conference now. Zhu tells reporters in Beijing that the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want a trade war -- despite having just announced retaliatory tariffs on $50bn of American goods. A trade war would be a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 for China and America, he says. Co-operation is the only right choice for both countries, Zhu insists. He says China wants to resolve the issues with America in a constructive way. Analyst John Kemp fears that Beijing and Washington won\u2019t be able to stop the situation escalating into a full-blown trade war: China\u2019s new tariffs are aimed firmly at America\u2019s agricultural industry, says John Ross, senior fellow at Renmin University of China: China\u2019s swift retaliation against the US has hit the financial markets. The Chinese yuan has fallen 0.4% against the US dollar, its biggest fall in two weeks, according to Reuters data. European stock markets have also slumped into the red; Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, while Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 1.4%. US stock market is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in around five hours. The Dow is down 1.3% in the futures market. The Chinese finance ministry has released more details of the new 25% tariffs which it will impose on US imports, in retaliation to Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs on its exports. It confirms that the reciprocal measures cover 106 different US products. The list includes soybeans, chemicals, whisky, cigars, some types of beef, corn and wheat. Some types of aircraft, lubricants, tobacco and orange juice are also targeted, along with some trucks and SUVs. Crucially, these imports were worth $50bn in 2017 -- that\u2019s the same value as the 1,300 Chinese goods which America is targetting with its new tariffs. Newsflash: China has just announced a fresh wave of tariffs on American goods, in retaliation to the US tariffs released last night. Chinese state TV is reporting that 106 US products are affected, including a 25% tariff on soybeans, automomobiles and chemicals. In total, the goods affected are worth $50bn per year. So, Beijing hasn\u2019t wasted any time in delivering on its pledge to hit back against the new proposed US tariffs on 1,300 of its products. Many US farmers rely on sales of soybeans to China, so this could have a significant impact on America\u2019s agriculture sector. The soybean price has taken an immediate hit. The array of Chinese products that would be affected by America\u2019s new 25% tariffs is lengthy, and varied. It includes \u201ccompounds of depleted uranium\u201d, nuclear reactor parts, a wide range of vaccines and medical products, aircraft tyres, stainless steel and aluminium in various sizes, and aircraft jets and tyres, domestic and commercial dishwashers, storage water heaters, and sewing machines. On the agricultural side, poultry incubators, haymaking machines and milking devices are all hit -- suggesting US farmers could suffer from these tariffs. Cranes, snowploughs and locomotive parts are all on the list too. Technology products are also hit, including TV cameras, a range of televisions, and even fuses. Even weapons are covered - including rocket launchers, flame-throwers, rifles, shotguns, pistols and military weapons. The US will now hold a consultation on whether to impose these tariffs. The full list is online here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of a trade war between China and America are swirling this morning as both sides ratchet up the pressure. Last night, the US government announced details of new 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China. The list of over 1,300 products targets China\u2019s industrial base, covering everything from industrial robots and electronics to metal alloys and aircraft parts. America claims these new 25% tariffs is prompted by Beijing\u2019s long-running \u2018intellectual property theft\u2019 of valuable technology and ideas developed by US companies. It says: The proposed list of products is based on extensive interagency economic analysis and would target products that benefit from China\u2019s industrial plans while minimizing the impact on the US economy. The move comes two days after China hit back against America\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium by imposing new trade hurdles on 120 US products - including fresh food and steel. And there are already signs that America\u2019s latest move could trigger fresh retaliations. China\u2019s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, Zhang Xiangchen, has declared this morning that his country will retaliate \u201cimmediately\u201d, claiming that the Trump administration is breaking WTO rules. In a punchy statement, Zhang says: \u201cThe findings of the U.S. Section 301 investigation are a willful distortion of facts and full of selective assertions and allegations, turning a blind eye to the actual progress that China has achieved in the market-oriented reforms, further opening-up and enhanced intellectual property protection.\u201d The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also quick to condemn this latest move - saying: \u201cAs the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and take corresponding measures of equal scale and strength against US products in accordance with Chinese law.\u201d That raises the danger that China imposes its own tariffs on a wider range of US goods, taking the global economy a little bit closer to protectionism. Also coming up today: We get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s building sector this morning, which may show the impact of last month\u2019s wintery weather. Plus, new jobs data from the Eurozone and America. Markets are expected to be subdued, given the trade tensions swirling around: Advertising giant WPP is also in the spotlight, after launching an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. He denies the allegations \u201cunreservedly\u201d, but investors may be concerned.

The notebook on which I\u2019m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u2019t (yet) exist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u2013 and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.</p> <p>Of course, it wouldn\u2019t just be factories left stranded by a trade war. A lot of people would be stranded too. The point of the famous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ddorn.net/papers/Autor-Dorn-Hanson-ChinaShock.pdf\">China shock</a>\u201d paper by Autor et al wasn\u2019t that rapid trade growth made America as a whole poorer, it was that rapid changes in the location of production displaced a significant number of workers, creating personal hardship and hurting their communities. The irony is that an anti-China shock would do exactly the same thing. And I, at least, care more about the impact on workers than the impact on capital.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some thoughts on trade wars and the stock market that doesn&#39;t like them <a href=\"https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a\">https://t.co/4PoalWlx7a</a></p>&mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/981529499539050496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ac500e8e4b0dec03f4a8aea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-04T17:48:05.801Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that President Donald Trump could raise the stakes further, possibly by labelling China a currency manipulator later this month.</strong></p> <p>In a note to clients, they say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next flashpoint may be the US Treasury\u2019s semi-annual currency report, due out this month.

      "bodyText": "Fears that Donald Trump is embroiling America in a global trade war intensified on Wednesday after China imposed tit-for-tat import taxes on the US and stock markets plunged. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped and then rallied after markets fell in Europe and Asia on worries of an intensifying trade conflict between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the latest example of Trump taking his appetite for disruption to the global stage. After Washington unveiled plans to impose tariffs on $50bn in Chinese imports Tuesday, China hit back with plans to tax a matching $50bn of US products, including beef, cars, planes, soybeans and whiskey. The US president has worn stock market success as a badge of honour and proof that, despite myriad controversies, the economy is booming under his presidency. But there are concerns that his aggressive tariffs and \u201cAmerica first\u201d instincts could undermine confidence and cause a slowdown. Trump claimed last month that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d. China is the biggest market for US soy. The American Soybean Association, a lobbying group representing 21,000 producers, warned that China\u2019s proposed 25% tariff on soybeans would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to American farmers. It estimated that farmers lost an estimated $1.72bn on Wednesday morning alone as soybean futures tumbled. John Heisdorffer, an Iowa farmer and the president of the association, said: \u201cThat\u2019s real money lost for farmers, and it is entirely preventable.\u201d He called on the White House to scrap its proposed tariffs. The car makers Ford and General Motors also issued statements calling for continued dialogue to resolve the escalating trade tensions. On Wednesday, Trump moved to play down concerns over a damaging trade war. He protested on Twitter: \u201cWe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!\u201d The president added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can\u2019t lose!\u201d The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, also urged calm. In an interview with CNBC, Ross said the tariffs announced by China amounted to a mere 0.3% of America\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cSo it\u2019s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u201d he said. Ross added that some US punitive action against Beijing has been \u201ccoming for a while\u201d over China\u2019s predatory behaviour involving technology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about on both sides is a fraction of 1% of both economies,\u201d Ross said. The tariffs will not take effect immediately. The US government is inviting public comment on its trade sanctions through 11 May and will hold a hearing on the plan on 15 May. China set no date for its 25% duties to take effect, saying it was waiting to see what Trump did. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, the spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: \u201cWe\u2019re going through the review period \u2013 we\u2019re very lucky that we have the best negotiator at the table in the president.\u201d She added: \u201cChina created this problem, not President Trump\u201d and insisted: \u201cWe may have a little bit of short-term pain, but we\u2019re going to have long-term success.\u201d The departure of Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker and so-called \u201cglobalist\u201d, as Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, and the appointment of Larry Kudlow as his successor, has been interpreted by analysts as indicating a shift towards protectionist policies. Asked whether the US tariffs against China were a negotiating ploy, Kudlow told reporters: \u201cPotentially. It\u2019s part of the process. I would take the president seriously on this tariff issue. There are carrots and sticks in life ... Both sides benefit by positive solutions that lower barriers.\u201d Kudlow said China should take Trump \u201cseriously\u201d on tariffs but that ultimately the president was a \u201cfree-trader\u201d. He added: \u201cSometimes the path to this kind of growth is a little rocky. That\u2019s the way the world works.\u201d China ran a $375bn goods trade surplus with the US in 2017. Trump has demanded that the China cut the trade gap by $100bn. Beijing said it has made a \u201crequest for consultations\u201d at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in response to the US tariffs, triggering that body\u2019s dispute settlement mechanism. Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing that China\u2019s door to dialogue with Washington remained open \u201cbut the US has missed the opportunity time and time again\u201d. He said talks between the two countries required \u201cmutual respect and equal treatment, instead of being coerced by one party unilaterally and condescendingly\u201d. Economists have expressed concern that global economic activity might stall if other governments are prompted to raise their own import barriers. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told the Associated Press: \u201cUS companies at this point would like to see robust communication between the US government and the Chinese government and serious negotiation on both sides, hopefully to avoid a trade war. I can only hope that we solve our differences as soon as possible to avoid damage to the US economy, Chinese economy and to US companies.\u201d Trump\u2019s praise of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and his claim that they have a close personal relationship have not prevented the threat of tariffs. Similarly, Trump continues to say he will try to \u201cget along\u201d with Russian president Vladimir Putin even as relations between the two governments sour.",

But there are concerns that his aggressive tariffs and \u201cAmerica first\u201d instincts could undermine confidence and cause a slowdown. </p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/969525362580484098\">claimed last month</a> that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d.</p> <p>China is the biggest market for US soy. <a href=\"https://soygrowers.com/\">The American Soybean Association,</a> a lobbying group representing 21,000 producers, warned that China\u2019s proposed 25% tariff on soybeans would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to American farmers. It estimated that farmers lost an estimated $1.72bn on Wednesday morning alone as soybean futures tumbled.</p> <p>John Heisdorffer, an Iowa farmer and the president of the association, said: \u201cThat\u2019s real money lost for farmers, and it is entirely preventable.\u201d He called on the White House to scrap its proposed tariffs. The car makers Ford and General Motors also issued statements calling for continued dialogue to resolve the escalating trade tensions.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump moved to play down concerns over a damaging trade war. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/981492087328792577\">He protested on Twitter:</a> \u201cWe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!\u201d</p> <p>The president added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can\u2019t lose!\u201d</p> <p>The US <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-china-tariffs-amount-to-0-point-3-percent-of-us-gdp.html\">commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross</a>, also urged calm. In an interview with CNBC, Ross said the tariffs announced by China amounted to a mere 0.3% of America\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cSo it\u2019s hardly a life-threatening activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ross added that some US punitive action against Beijing has been \u201ccoming for a while\u201d over China\u2019s predatory behaviour involving technology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about on both sides is a fraction of 1% of both economies,\u201d Ross said.</p> <p>The tariffs will not take effect immediately. The US government is inviting public comment on its trade sanctions through 11 May and will hold a hearing on the plan on 15 May. China set no date for its 25% duties to take effect, saying it was waiting to see what Trump did.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, the spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: \u201cWe\u2019re going through the review period \u2013 we\u2019re very lucky that we have the best negotiator at the table in the president.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cChina created this problem, not President Trump\u201d and insisted: \u201cWe may have a little bit of short-term pain, but we\u2019re going to have long-term success.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/gary-cohn-quits-trump-economic-adviser\">The departure of Gary Cohn,</a> a former Goldman Sachs banker and so-called \u201cglobalist\u201d, as Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, and the appointment of Larry Kudlow as his successor, has been interpreted by analysts as indicating a shift towards protectionist policies.<br></p> <p>Asked whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/03/us-plans-tariffs-chinese-imports-list\">US tariffs against China</a> were a negotiating ploy, Kudlow told reporters: \u201cPotentially. It\u2019s part of the process. I would take the president seriously on this tariff issue. There are carrots and sticks in life ... Both sides benefit by positive solutions that lower barriers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kudlow said China should take Trump \u201cseriously\u201d on tariffs but that ultimately the president was a \u201cfree-trader\u201d. He added: \u201cSometimes the path to this kind of growth is a little rocky. That\u2019s the way the world works.\u201d</p> <p>China ran a $375bn goods trade surplus with the US in 2017. Trump has demanded that the China cut the trade gap by $100bn. Beijing said it has made a \u201crequest for consultations\u201d at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in response to the US tariffs, triggering that body\u2019s dispute settlement mechanism.</p> <p>Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing that China\u2019s door to dialogue with Washington remained open \u201cbut the US has missed the opportunity time and time again\u201d. He said talks between the two countries required \u201cmutual respect and equal treatment, instead of being coerced by one party unilaterally and condescendingly\u201d.</p> <p>Economists have expressed concern that global economic activity might stall if other governments are prompted to raise their own import barriers.</p> <p>William Zarit, chairman of the<a href=\"https://www.amchamchina.org/\"> American Chamber of Commerce in China,</a> told the Associated Press: \u201cUS companies at this point would like to see robust communication between the US government and the Chinese government and serious negotiation on both sides, hopefully to avoid a trade war. I can only hope that we solve our differences as soon as possible to avoid damage to the US economy, Chinese economy and to US companies.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china\">praise of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping</a>, and his claim that they have a close personal relationship have not prevented the threat of tariffs. Similarly, Trump continues to say he will try to \u201cget along\u201d with Russian president Vladimir Putin even as relations between the two governments sour.</p>",

It digested the news that the board of WPP has hired independent counsel to investigate an allegation of \u201cpersonal misconduct\u201d against chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell and immediately advanced the story by several jumps. What\u2019s the succession plan? Who\u2019s the next boss? What does it all mean for WPP\u2019s strategy? Will bits and pieces of the advertising empire assembled by Sorrell over the past 32 years now be sold to the highest bidder? That line of questioning rather ignores the fact that Sorrell \u201cunreservedly\u201d rejects the unspecified allegations and presumably expects to be wholly vindicated. If he is indeed cleared, it\u2019s quite possible that, even at the age of 73, he intends to stay in harness for years.

The share price has fallen 40% in the past year as the advertising market has turned soft and there is a widely held view that WPP needs a strategic re-boot. Kantar, the market research and data business, is a prime candidate for a sale, runs one argument, and Sorrell\u2019s personal attachment to the unit is getting in the way of commercial logic. Sorrell, if he survives with his job and his integrity intact, would be wise to address those points. He has collected \u00a3200m in pay and bonuses over the past five years and now investors, who approved the over-the-top incentive scheme in the first place, want to know how he plans to restore the share price. Their request is reasonable, even if the current drama is resolved in Sorrell\u2019s favour. Mothercare tries the Tesco treatment If in doubt, send for an ex-Tesco executive. It worked at Morrisons, so you can\u2019t blame Mothercare for giving it a go. David Wood arrives as chief executive directly from Kmart in the US but he made his name at the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain \u2013 on the home front and internationally. Mark Newton-Jones is the boss heading to the exit and, given the collapse in Mothercare\u2019s share price, can hardly be surprised that time has been called on his four years in charge. Last month the group revealed it is in danger of breaching its banking covenants and is in talks with its lenders to secure funds for a turnaround programme. Yet chairman Alan Parker\u2019s explanation that \u201cit is essential that we have the most effective leadership in place to meet our ambitions for our customers and our shareholders\u201d feels very limp. Parker has been chair since 2011 and Wood becomes the fifth chief executive on his watch, if one includes the six months that Parker did the job himself. If Mothercare has been too slow to cut costs and react to the rise of online retailing, doesn\u2019t the high-profile and long-serving chair also carry some of the blame? Good for Luton, but how does it play at Ellesmere Port? \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a vote of confidence in Vauxhall\u2019s high-skilled workforce and the UK\u2019s world leading automotive sector,\u201d crowed business secretary Greg Clark as PSA, the French owner of Vauxhall, unveiled plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van in Luton. Let\u2019s hope Clark is right \u2013 but he shouldn\u2019t celebrate too soon. PSA\u2019s investment clearly shows confidence in the well-equipped facility in Luton, which beat competition from plants in Germany and Poland, but one can\u2019t draw UK-wide conclusions. The real test of PSA\u2019s enthusiasm for making vehicles in the UK after Brexit lies in its commitment to Ellesmere Port, home of the Astra. On that score, PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares said next to nothing: no decision will be made before 2020 and post-Brexit trade arrangements will be a major factor. Tavares is allowed to be vague at this stage, but that remark offered few grounds for optimism.",

    "webTitle": "Vauxhall\u2019s Luton plant to increase production despite Brexit fears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The immediate future of Vauxhall\u2019s Luton plant has been secured after its French owner announced plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van and increase production in 2019. PSA, the manufacturer of Peugeot and Citroen that acquired Vauxhall last year, is expected to invest around \u00a3100m in the plant despite persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The UK government has given PSA \u00a39m to facilitate the expansion, which will be regarded as an important vote of confidence in Britain. The car industry has repeatedly warned that investment decisions are on hold as the future of cross-border manufacturing and trade with the EU is decided. Although PSA would not put a figure on jobs, the Unite union said it believed 350-450 additional jobs could be created at Luton, and that the plant\u2019s survival was effectively guaranteed for at least 10-12 years. PSA\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, also signalled that some Peugeot and Citroen vans would be made at Luton, as the factory\u2019s capacity was to increase from 60,000 to 100,000 vehicles per year. Workers in Luton, where cars have been made since 1905, have faced an uncertain future since the PSA takeover from General Motors in 2017. Despite pledges to avoid redundancies, PSA has announced 650 job cuts at Vauxhall\u2019s other plant in Ellesmere Port, where the Astra car is made. Tavares said a decision on Ellesmere Port would not be made before 2020, when there would be more clarity on Brexit and the result of PSA\u2019s plans to increase productivity at the plant. Announcing the decision to expand at Luton, Tavares said: \u201cOur growing business requires more high-quality, desirable vans to meet our customers\u2019 demands, which we can produce here at Luton.\u201d Manufacturing costs had decreased by 17%, he said. \u201cBut we have more work to do, as we have to reduce costs by 20% to meet European competitors.\u201d He said government assurances that it would seek tariff-free and frictionless trade had helped \u201csecure the workforce\u201d at Luton, but added: \u201cWe have made this decision in spite of Brexit. The automotive industry lacks certainty and Brexit remains a concern for our business.\u201d The business secretary, Greg Clark, who joined Tavares in Luton for the announcement, said: \u201cI know there were concerns when GM sold the plant to PSA. So I\u2019m absolutely delighted that this big investment in the future is being made today.\u201d Clark said 75% of Vauxhall\u2019s products were exported, making it one of the most successful industrial facilities in the UK. He added: \u201cThis is about not only safeguarding the 1,400 jobs here, but expanding jobs available in the future and making sure that for many years to come Luton remains synonymous with commercial vehicles.\u201d The business secretary said the government was \u201cabsolutely clear of the central requirement to maintain access to markets that have been important \u2013 that means trade that is tariff-free and frictionless\u201d. Tavares said the outcome of Brexit talks would partly determine Ellesmere Port\u2019s fate, and he acknowledged that the Luton decision remained a risk ahead of an exit deal. But he said: \u201cThe world is total chaos. If you wait for everyone to decide it is the right time to invest, the only thing you can be sure about is it is too late, so you have to take some risk.\u201d He added: \u201cThe management team of this plant control their destiny \u2026 There is nothing more dangerous for a plant than a complacent management team.\u201d Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said the Luton expansion was good news, but warned it was \u201ca complicated package, with pros and cons\u201d. Workers are likely to have accept new terms and conditions in return for guarantees on jobs, and union members will still have to vote to accept a deal. \u201cClearly the idea that this plant now has a vehicle with a 10- to 12-year shelf life and could create 350-450 new jobs is a huge plus,\u201d McCluskey said. \u201cBut we want to make sure we have similar assurances for Ellesmere Port.\u201d He said he rejected Tavares\u2019s claims that UK plants were less productive, adding: \u201cWe have a world-class workforce. Brexit and the confusion and the uncertainty doesn\u2019t help. All of industry tells me they are deeply concerned. But Carlos Tavares has said repeatedly that he doesn\u2019t want to close any car plants.\u201d",

The prospect of a return to full-scale 1930s protectionism was thought to be minimal. Cooler heads would prevail. A month on, the chances of a trade war between the US and China have significantly increased. Trump has said he will slap a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese goods and Beijing has now responded in kind. It has drawn up a list of US goods also worth $50bn which it will target if the White House goes ahead with its action. For the moment, this is simply a gigantic game of chicken. If Trump withdraws his threatened tariffs, the Chinese have said they will do the same. A trade war is not inevitable, but the risk of sleepwalking into a damaging conflict that nobody really wants is there. While Trump spread his tariffs over a broad range of Chinese products, Beijing opted to target a small number of products including aerospace and chemicals. By putting soya beans on its hit list, China also served notice on Trump that it is willing to inflict economic pain on his supporters in swing states. China\u2019s tough approach has come as something of a surprise, and reflects a growing global self-confidence. The economic consequences of this spat still look far less serious than they were in the 1930s, when protectionism was a response to a deep slump. The global economy is growing more quickly than at any time since the financial meltdown of a decade ago, and it will take more than a 25% levy on a combined $100bn of imports to change that. But this state of affairs may not last. First, there is a risk that the conflict will escalate. Given that the US\u2019s annual trade deficit with China is close to $400bn, Trump thinks Xi Jinping has more to lose than he does, which is true. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, was doing his best to lower the temperature, saying the US action was part of a negotiating strategy. But his boss is unpredictable. He could target a wider range of Chinese imports or include the EU and the US\u2019s Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, on his hit list. Second, even the threat of a trade war has sent tremors through the world\u2019s financial markets. The real thing will do even more serious damage to share prices and to business confidence. Finally, tariffs are the equivalent of a tax on consumers. They protect some industries but only at the cost of raising prices and reducing spending power. Trump says his action is a response to China\u2019s unfair trading practices, including widespread industrial piracy, and he has a point. Back in the 1990s, the US was instrumental in creating the World Trade Organisation to deal with issues of this sort, but the current administration has little time for the WTO, preferring unilateral rather than multilateral solutions. How this ends is now up to Trump. It may or may not be true that trade wars are easy to win, but they are certainly easier to start than they are to stop. Over to you, Mr President.",

It will provide funds to support the continued operation of their 18 depots around the country. The deal is dependent on Conviviality going into administration. Last week Conviviality said investors had refused its request for \u00a3125m of new money, which it needed to stave off bankruptcy after a string of shock profit warnings. The group has since been attempting to find buyers. On Wednesday, Conviviality said it was still in discussions with a number of parties about the sale of its Bargain Booze and Wine Rack retail chains, which employ about 1,800 people. Shareholders in the company, which has annual sales of \u00a31.6bn, are likely to receive \u201clittle-to-nil\u201d value for their shares, which have been suspended on the junior AIM stock market since 14 March after a series of profit warnings. The first warning was blamed by the company on an erroneous calculation made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins. It later admitted it had not budgeted for a \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality\u2019s chief executive, Diana Hunter, stepped down after City analysts criticised the company\u2019s financial controls and processes. The firm is a major player in the UK drinks industry, supplying more than 700 off-licences and serving more than 23,000 pubs and restaurants including the JD Wetherspoon chain, via Bibendum and Matthew Clark, which is the UK\u2019s largest distributor to pubs and restaurants. C&amp;C Group said it would run the wholesale operation as a separate business. Stephen Glancey, group chief executive of C&amp;C, said: \u201cWe know the Matthew Clark and Bibendum businesses very well. They are great businesses with unparalleled on-trade market access, a wide range of supplier relationships and supported by a knowledgeable and loyal employee base. \u201cThe last few weeks have been challenging for employees, customers and suppliers alike. We hope today\u2019s announcement can put an end to this period of disruption and uncertainty. We look forward to working with our new colleagues and other stakeholders to bring stability and restore the group\u2019s position as one of the leading and most respected drinks suppliers to the UK hospitality sector.\u201d",

The childrenswear and maternity specialist said on Wednesday that Mark Newton-Jones was leaving with immediate effect after four years in the top job. He has been succeeded by David Wood, previously president of Kmart Holdings, a $3bn grocery, retail and pharmaceutical business in the US. Wood has also held senior roles at Tesco in the UK and overseas. Mothercare\u2019s chairman, Alan Parker, said Wood\u2019s appointment would be a turning point for the ailing company, enabling it to benefit from fresh leadership and Wood\u2019s experience in returning Kmart to sustainable profit growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a premier league manager for a premier league job,\u201d he said. Parker said Newton-Jones was only told this morning that the board had decided to replace him and said it would have come as a surprise. \u201cThese things are a surprise when they happen. We\u2019ve got to move on from here.\u201d He added: \u201cMothercare is a great brand with a great future, but it is facing a number of challenges, not least a highly competitive retail environment. We have made positive progress but it is essential that we have the most effective leadership in place to meet our ambitions for our customers and our shareholders. David has a great track record in similar circumstances across international and consumer facing brands and is a highly effective operator of retail operations.\u201d Wood said the retailer\u2019s current strategy - with a focus on improving its store format and digital offering, as well as reducing costs - made sense but that it was not delivering the results he would have expected. He said it was too early to comment on his specific plans to turnaround Mothercare\u2019s fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s day one. We need to unpick why we\u2019re not performing as we\u2019d like to be.\u201d Last month Mothercare revealed it was in financial straits as poor trading put it at risk of breaching the terms of its loans. It is in talks to raise the funds needed for a turnaround programme, which will involve the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores as sales move online. Wood said he was joining a business with \u201ca fantastic heritage and an exciting future\u201d. He added: \u201cMy immediate focus is to ensure Mothercare is put back on a sound financial footing and deliver a successful plan to improve performance. Central to this will be our customers and their experience, securing Mothercare\u2019s reputation as the number one choice for parents.\u201d Mothercare\u2019s struggles reflect a wider trend on UK high streets. Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed into administration in February, while Carpetright issued its third profit warning in four months. However Parker insisted: \u201cMothercare is absolutely going to be successful.\u201d",

Shoppers made 5% fewer visits to grocery shops during the stormy weather, having stocked their cupboards with warming foods in preparation for the freezing temperatures, according to the data firm Kantar Worldpanel. \u201cThe beast from the east played havoc with consumers\u2019 usual shopping plans,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Sales of tinned soup rose 27.5% over the last month while hot drink sales increased by 8.4% as people reacted to the colder weather. However, despite the poor weather, grocery sales increased in value by 2.5% in the first 12 weeks of 2018, compared to the same period last year. Sales rose at all major chains apart from Iceland, where they fell 0.8%. Supermarket sales over the period were boosted by Easter, which was earlier this year than in 2017. UK shoppers bought nearly 15 million Easter eggs in March according to Kantar, up 69% on the same month last year. Sales of hot cross buns jumped \u00a37.7m. Discount chains Aldi and Lidl continued to increase their share of the UK grocery market over the first 12 weeks of the year, at the expense of some of the bigger, more established names. Aldi increased its share to 7.3% from 6.8% a year earlier, while Lidl\u2019s rose to 5.3% from 5%. Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, held on to the number one spot with a 27.6% share of the market, unchanged from the same period in 2017. However market share dipped among the remaining three of the so-called \u2018big four\u2019 supermarkets \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons. Kantar said that supermarket prices were 2.5% higher over the 12 weeks compared with a year earlier, with butter, fish pork and lamb among the sharpest risers. The research firm makes its inflation calculation by comparing the prices of over 75,000 identical products year-on-year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s iron grip as chief executive of WPP is under threat after the advertising group hired a law firm to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct. Sorrell is one of Britain\u2019s best-known and most highly paid business leaders. He is also the longest-serving FTSE-100 chief executive and has run the sprawling WPP empire since starting the business in 1985. In the last five years alone Sorrell has been paid well over \u00a3200m for running the world\u2019s largest advertising group thanks to lucrative and highly controversial reward schemes. His \u00a370m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. The investigation will increase pressure on Sorrell, who is already feeling the strain as WPP\u2019s share price has tumbled almost 40% in the last year to its lowest point since 2013. The price slump has wiped \u00a39bn off the value of the business, which owns 406 separate advertising and marketing firms in more than 100 countries, including top-flight brands such as Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson. It has 134,000 staff. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as \u201cnot a pretty year\u201d. The 73-year-old \u201cunreservedly\u201d denied the misconduct allegation, which involves the improper use of company funds and allegations of improper personal behaviour. \u201cThe board of WPP has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing. The allegations do not involve amounts which are material to WPP.\u201d Sorrell, who is on a rare holiday, said he rejected the allegation but understood that the company had to investigate the matter. \u201cWPP is investigating an allegation of financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cThis allegation is being investigated by a law firm. I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it. I understand that this process will be completed shortly. Obviously, I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way.\u201d WPP has called in two top law firms, Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May, to advise on the investigation. The trouble at the top has once again put a spotlight on the issue of succession at WPP amid accusations of a \u201cSorrellcentricity\u201d \u2013 the view that Sorrell runs the giant business autocratically as a personal fiefdom, dominating decision-making. The question of who will succeed Sorrell is raised every year at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting. Sorrell has never given any indication that he may be ready to step back. Roberto Quarta, a US businessman hired as WPP\u2019s chairman two years ago, has said that succession planning has intensified, becoming \u201ceven more focused and detailed\u201d. He said there was an \u201cexceptional team of potential candidates\u201d from WPP\u2019s top management, as well as a \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d. There is understood to be tension about Sorrell\u2019s future among members of WPP\u2019s 12-strong board, which has been heightened by the recent performance slump. At least one director is known to be agitating to oust him. \u201cIf Sorrell were to leave the company for any reason, WPP has a relatively deep bench of talent who could pick up any slack on a near-term basis,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. \u201cA more significant issue relates to who would lead the company next and what strategic direction the company would pursue.\u201d WPP shares fell a further 2% in trading on Wednesday in response to the investigation. Sorrell has denied the group\u2019s poor recent performance was a result of his agencies being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. He said WPP spent more than $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) of its clients\u2019 advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. Sorrell and his family trust owns a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about \u00a3250m. \u201cAs a significant share-owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over 30 years ago, remains absolute \u2013 to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,\u201d Sorrell said.",
