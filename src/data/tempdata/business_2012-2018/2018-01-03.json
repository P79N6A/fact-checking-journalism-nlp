      "bodyText": "Salvation for retailers? Next\u2019s mildly upbeat report on its pre-Christmas trading was good for share prices in the sector, but nobody overdid the cheer \u2013 and rightly so. First, it is hardly a revelation that properly cold weather is useful for shifting coats and jumpers. Second, Next runs to its own financial rules. It can tolerate a 6% plunge in sales in its shops because its online operation is so much bigger than most rivals\u2019. Online growth of 13.6% meant Next\u2019s overall sales for the Christmas period netted out at plus 1.5%. The mechanics may not work so smoothly for others. Even at Next, however, there are two ways to view the numbers. An optimistic interpretation says the group has come through a tricky year in fine shape given that the chief executive, Simon Wolfson, was warning a year ago of \u201cexceptional levels of uncertainty in the clothing sector\u201d. On the other hand, expected full-year profits of \u00a3725m represent a fall of 8% and, if Lord Wolfson\u2019s early guess proves correct, they will go lower yet. For the 12 months to January 2019, \u00a3705m is pencilled in. That would mean three years in a row of falling profits. The peak was \u00a3821m in 2016, thus the City frets that Next has become an exercise in managing decline. Which view is right? For the time being, Next shareholders should probably relax. Yes, plunging sales in the shops (at a rate of about 8% on a like-for-like basis) looks alarming, but Wolfson is not ignoring the problem. The stores would still be an asset if the like-for-like decline was 10%, he argues, given the luxury of short leaseholds and the relative freedom to shut shops. He deserves the benefit of the doubt: no other retailer dares to display similar leasehold calculations, probably because their numbers would be less reassuring. What\u2019s more, Next is still generating \u00a3300m of surplus cash a year, enough to keep the share buyback wheels turning and boost earnings per share. There is no disgrace in being a mature business when you have those advantages. Just don\u2019t assume the same applies to the rest of the mainstream clothing sector: Next started early online and is a rule unto itself. Carillion talks itself into trouble An investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into \u201cthe timeliness and content\u201d of the ailing construction firm Carillion\u2019s announcements between December 2016 and July 2017 was inevitable. Take a look at the run of the breezy and confident headlines in Carillion\u2019s dispatches to shareholders that proceeded the confession of corporate calamity. December 2016: \u201cMeeting expectations led by a strong performance in support services.\u201d March 2017: \u201cPerformance in line with expectations.\u201d May 2017: \u201cTrading conditions unchanged. Positive work winning performance.\u201d Then came the humdinger 10 weeks later: \u201cStrategic review and management changes,\u201d which translated as a monstrous profit warning, debts going through the roof and the ousting of the then chief executive, Richard Howson. The share price halved in the next three days, and ended 2017 90% lower than it started the year. The case for the defence is that big construction outfits can be volatile and complex businesses at the best of times. Profit margins tend to be thin, cost overruns happen and contracts can turn sour suddenly. Yet, even by industry standards, the cratering of Carillion, which employs 43,000 people, has been spectacular. In the last annual report, shareholders will find eight pages devoted to the management of risk, including this proud boast: \u201cThe group\u2019s policy is to ensure that all risks are identified, evaluated and an appropriate response determined prior to any commitment being made to any other party.\u201d If that\u2019s your position, don\u2019t be surprised that the regulator wants to know more. \u2018Fat Cat Thursday\u2019 highlights pay divide The average corporate fat cat may regard the High Pay Centre\u2019s \u201cFat Cat Thursday\u201d exercise as terribly crude. If so, they would be missing the point. The beauty of the calculation lies in the way it brings raw statistics to life. Talking about a pay ratio of 120:1 between chief executives and average employees can sound too theoretical. It is much easier to understand the disparity in earnings through this lens: it takes the bosses less than three working days to earn what the average employee will pick up all year. The fat cat day, which has been running for a few years, may have played a small role in persuading the government to support the mandatory publication of pay ratios for companies. Once adopted, the ratios should allow workers at those companies to do their own calculations. If remuneration committees are embarrassed by the results, so be it. They could always try defining what they regard as fair \u2013 and then making it happen. The average, note, was 50:1 two decades ago.",

    "webTitle": "US drug firm offers cure for blindness \u2013 at $425,000 an eye", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A drug whose inventors claim it can cure a rare form of blindness is to be one of the most expensive medicines ever sold at $850,000 (\u00a3630,000). Luxturna is injected directly into the eye to address the root cause of visual impairment by replacing a defective gene in the retina. It is the first gene therapy to be approved for use in the US, and was given the go-ahead by the Federal Drug Administration last month. However, the price of the treatment has only just been revealed. Spark Therapeutics, the company behind the treatment, had previously claimed the treatment was worth $1m, citing the cost of a lifetime of blindness in lost earnings and wages for caregivers. But the firm said it had settled for the lower price of $850,000, or $425,000 per eye. It will also offer ways to spread the cost to health insurers, which have expressed concern about their ability to cover the expense. \u201cWe wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients,\u201d said Spark Therapeutics\u2019 chief executive, Jeff Marrazzo. Luxturna is one of an emerging breed of gene therapies that differ from more established medicines administered over a period of time. Such treatments involve a one-off procedure to alter defective DNA, allowing the body to repair the problem itself. They include a treatment for haemophilia and another for so-called \u201cbubble baby\u201d syndrome, where sufferers have to live in a sterile environment, which is to be offered on the NHS despite a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The sky-high price of some drugs \u2013 and so-called price-gouging by drug firms \u2013 became an issue in the US presidential election after Martin Shkreli, a US hedge fund entrepreneur, bought the drug Daraprim, used in the treatment of Aids and cancer, and hiked its price from $13.50 to $750. But the starting price of some new drugs has soared. Glybera, a gene therapy for a rare protein disorder, was launched in 2012 with a price tag of $1.2m. However, it was never approved in the US and was discontinued by manufacturers uniQure because of a lack of demand. Gene therapy is not alone in commanding staggering sums, particularly when it comes to treatments for rare diseases. Soliris, a drug that treats a condition called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that attacks red blood cells, can cost up to $700,000 a year, while Elaprase, used in the treatment of Hunter syndrome, costs $500,000 a year. Luxturna could potentially become available free on the NHS in the UK after being submitted for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A green light from the EMA is a prerequisite for approval by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the UK\u2019s healthcare costs watchdog. In clinical trials, injections of Luxturna restored eyesight to people with severe visual impairment due to retinal dystrophy. Spark estimates that up to 2,000 people in the US suffer from the condition, with the number of sufferers rising to 6,000 when Europe and other markets where it could sell the treatment are included. The company said it had agreed bespoke deals with US insurers, which cover the cost of most US prescriptions, and they will get a refund if the drug doesn\u2019t work as expected. Spark is also discussing a proposalfor insurers to pay for the drug in instalments over several years. The Philadelphia-based company said it would also pay transport costs not covered by insurance to help patients get access to treatment centres.",

    "webTitle": "Poundland seals \u00a3180m financing deal to reduce reliance on Steinhoff", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland has secured up to \u00a3180m of independent financing that will reduce its reliance on its troubled South African owner Steinhoff International after bumper Christmas trading. Pepkor Europe, the European owner of Poundland, the Pep&amp;Co clothing business and two other chains, has arranged a two-year loan facility from US investment firm Davidson Kempner Capital Management. Pepkor is owned by Steinhoff. The loan money will be shared with Harveys and Bensons for Beds, the two British furniture chains owned by Steinhoff. Andy Bond, the chief executive of Pepkor Europe, said that as a result of the deal the group was no longer dependent on working capital from Steinhoff, which is facing criminal and tax investigations relating to an estimated $7bn (\u00a35.3bn) hole in its accounts. \u201cOur European Pepkor businesses \u2013 Poundland, Dealz, Pep&amp;Co and Pepco in eastern Europe are firing on all cylinders, adding customers and growing market share,\u201d said Bond. \u201cThey are all independently profitable, delivering positive cash flows.\u201d It is hoped the financing will help improve Poundland\u2019s rating with credit insurers, who reduced cover for the chain\u2019s suppliers in the light of Steinhoff\u2019s financial problems. There had also been concerns that credit facilities for Poundland, Harveys and Bensons for Beds would be cut back, affecting their ability to trade. Barry Williams, Poundland\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, described the finance package as a \u201cbig vote of confidence\u201d that would provide stability. He said Poundland had enjoyed a record performance over the festive season. Sales rose 5.6% in the 12 weeks to 24 December as it sold more than 5m rolls of wrapping paper, and almost 250,000 items from its new Nooky sex toy range. \u201cWe had a banging Christmas,\u201d said Williams. The retailer sold all 500,000 of its initial run of Toblerone copycat Twin Peaks bars while increasing sales of the original by more than 10%. After a legal battle with Toblerone\u2019s owner Mondel\u0113z, Poundland agreed to change the shape of its bar. There have been rumours that Steinhoff, which bought Poundland for \u00a3610m just over a year ago, will be forced to sell the retailer as part of efforts to resolve its financial difficulties. Williams said any decision on the future ownership of Poundland would not be taken by the retailer\u2019s board, but said Poundland was among a group of \u201cvery attractive assets to Steinhoff based on our performance\u201d. Williams said he could not speculate on how long it would take to resolve Steinhoff\u2019s issues, which were not related directly to Poundland or Pepkor Europe\u2019s accounts or leadership team. Steinhoff\u2019s shares have fallen more than 80% since it revealed the financial woes, and credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded the company\u2019s debt to junk status. Earlier this week, Steinhoff admitted its accounts dating back to 2015 could not be relied upon.",

Pepkor is owned by Steinhoff. </p> <p>The loan money will be shared with Harveys and Bensons for Beds, the two British furniture chains owned by Steinhoff.</p> <p>Andy Bond, the chief executive of Pepkor Europe, said that as a result of the deal the group was no longer dependent on working capital from Steinhoff, which is facing criminal and tax investigations relating to an estimated $7bn (\u00a35.3bn) hole in its accounts. </p> <p>\u201cOur European Pepkor businesses \u2013 Poundland, Dealz, Pep&amp;Co and Pepco in eastern Europe are firing on all cylinders, adding customers and growing market share,\u201d said Bond. \u201cThey are all independently profitable, delivering positive cash flows.\u201d </p> <p>It is hoped the financing will help improve Poundland\u2019s rating with credit insurers, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/poundland-suppliers-hit-by-insurance-downgrade\">reduced cover for the chain\u2019s suppliers</a> in the light of Steinhoff\u2019s financial problems. There had also been concerns that credit facilities for Poundland, Harveys and Bensons for Beds <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/19/creditors-desert-poundland-owner-amid-south-africa-accounting-scandal\">would be cut back, affecting their ability to trade</a>.</p> <p>Barry Williams, Poundland\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, described the finance package as a \u201cbig vote of confidence\u201d that would provide stability.</p> <p>He said Poundland had enjoyed a record performance over the festive season. Sales rose 5.6% in the 12 weeks to 24 December as it sold more than 5m rolls of wrapping paper, and almost 250,000 items from its new Nooky sex toy range. \u201cWe had a banging Christmas,\u201d said Williams.</p> <p>The retailer sold all 500,000 of its initial run of Toblerone copycat Twin Peaks bars while increasing sales of the original by more than 10%. After <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/poundland-reaches-deal-with-toblerone-makers-over-copycat-bar\">a legal battle with Toblerone\u2019s owner Mondel\u0113z</a>, Poundland agreed to change the shape of its bar.</p> <p>There have been rumours that Steinhoff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/poundland-shareholders-approve-takeover-by-steinhoff\">which bought Poundland for \u00a3610m just over a year ago</a>, will be forced to sell the retailer as part of efforts to resolve its financial difficulties.</p> <p>Williams said any decision on the future ownership of Poundland would not be taken by the retailer\u2019s board, but said Poundland was among a group of \u201cvery attractive assets to Steinhoff based on our performance\u201d.</p> <p>Williams said he could not speculate on how long it would take to resolve Steinhoff\u2019s issues, which were not related directly to Poundland or Pepkor Europe\u2019s accounts or leadership team. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Steinhoff\u2019s shares have fallen more than 80% since it revealed the financial woes, and credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded the company\u2019s debt to junk status. Earlier this week, Steinhoff admitted its accounts dating back to 2015 could not be relied upon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Next has raised hopes for the retail sector by revealing a better than expected Christmas, with strong online sales more than offsetting grim trading at its high street stores. The clothing and home chain said overall sales rose 1.5% in the 54 days to 24 December in a trading statement that kicked off the festive reporting season. A fall of 0.3% had been forecast. Next upgraded its profit expectations for the year to January by \u00a38m, to \u00a3725m, after sales received a last-minute boost from the colder weather in the run-up to Christmas. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, said many shoppers had picked up cold weather gear for the first time in several seasons as snow and ice hit large parts of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s really the first cold winter we have had for about three years,\u201d he said. Shares in Next jumped almost 7%. Marks &amp; Spencer, the Primark owner Associated British Foods, Sports Direct, Boohoo.com and JD Sports were also up on hopes that they may have fared better than expected too. The Co-op also enjoyed a bumper Christmas, with sales up 6.2% at established stores in the two weeks to 1 January. The mutual had expected a strong festive season as its small shops were able to stay open longer than supermarkets on a Sunday, giving them an edge on Christmas Eve. Lord Wolfson said Next\u2019s trading was \u201cnot enough to say there has been a huge change in the consumer economy\u201d. He said Next\u2019s online Directory business picked up orders when snow kept shoppers away from stores, and that consumers were more confident about next-day delivery promises, which meant more online sales closer to Christmas. All of Next\u2019s growth was online, where sales rose 13.6%. Its high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. That pattern is expected to be repeated across the retail sector next week as companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and House of Fraser report on the most important part of the trading year. The number of in-store shoppers was down 2.3% between 27 and 30 December compared with the same period last year, according to monitoring service Springboard. Numbers dived 10.5% on New Year\u2019s Eve as Storm Dylan kept shoppers at home. Retailers had been expected to suffer a tricky trading period after several reported poor autumn sales. Next shares dived in October when it warned of \u201cextremely volatile\u201d trading. Alistair Davies, a retail analyst at Investec Securities, said there would be relief that trading at Next was better than expected. But he added: \u201cWe would caution against reading too much across to other retail stocks \u2013 the reality is that even though Next\u2019s Christmas numbers are better than expected, the company has still had a tough Christmas.\u201d The company warned of a difficult year ahead in which profits were likely to fall. It said costs were expected to rise faster than sales, with shoppers being held back by declining real incomes and a preference for spending on restaurants, holidays and leisure than clothes. Wolfson said cost price inflation was easing and was likely to disappear in the second half of the year. Clothing price rises were expected to slow from 4% over the last year to 2% in the first half of 2018. \u201cThe inflationary bubble that hit the UK economy as a result of the pound\u2019s fall will come out of the numbers and we are hoping that will affect the wider economy as well.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here",

      "bodyText": "After Tuesday\u2019s disappointing UK manufacturing survey, the construction data for December was also underwhelming. The IHS/Markit construction PMI saw a slowdown in growth for the first time since September. All eyes will now be on the UK services figures due out on Thursday to get a clear snapshot of how the country\u2019s economy performed in the final month of 2017. Earlier there was positive news from Germany, with the jobless rate at a record low of 5.5%. Better than expected Christmas trading from Next lifted the retailers\u2019 shares and gave investors hope for the whole sector\u2019s festive performance. But the rise in Next shares was not enough to lift the UK market out of the post-holiday doldrums, with the FTSE 100 slipping back and forth from postive to negative. The index is currently up 0.13% but European markets have turned in a better performance and Wall Street has opened higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The record breaking run on Wall Street continues, at least as far as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are concerned. The S&amp;P is up 0.11% and Nasdaq 0.15% better at the open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.02% higher in early trading. The pattern of a rise in European markets and a slight dip in the FTSE 100 continues. Markets appear to have shrugged off any worries about the new regulatory regime - Mifid II - which comes into effect today. Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: Global equities are generally positive as investors calmly digest the impact of the vast MiFID II regulation taking effect across the globe, while trading volumes gradually return following the New Year. German stocks are outperforming as the US dollar rebounds from its lows, denting Euro strength to aid the region\u2019s exporting names, while the flat FTSE 100 comes as a result of GBP/USD weakness offsetting GBP/EUR strength. Reuters has a report on the new rules: The rollout of new rules on Wednesday that aim to make European Union financial markets safer and more transparent has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU\u2019s markets watchdog said. The new regime shines a spotlight on the inner workings of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to provide detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions. Big banks spent an estimated $2 billion collectively last year to upgrade IT systems to prepare. \u201cWhat we can see for our part, is no glitches so far,\u201d Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told reporters. \u201cIt will be the first time we have a complete overview of all financial instruments in the EU.\u201d European stock and bond volumes were light in early trading. \u201cSo far [there is] no difference compared to a regular day,\u201d said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets. \u201cVolume isn\u2019t expected to be massive or back to normal either due to not everybody being back from holidays, and not much going on in regard to major news or economic data.\u201d ...The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to give banks, asset managers and exchanges more time to get ready... Market nerves were eased by ESMA announcing measures just before Christmas to give companies more time to comply with some key requirements. Oil is edging higher again, helped by the output caps from Opec and Russia and concerns about the protests in Iran. Brent crude is currently up 0.63% to $66.99 a barrel, having earlier climbed as high as $67.08. Here\u2019s our story on the UK construction figures, from Richard Partington: Britain\u2019s construction industry is its least optimistic for five years amid fears over Brexit and an economic slowdown, according to a survey. Despite some pockets of strength as building firms won the most work for several months in December, the balance of companies expecting a rise in output levels over the next 12 months was the weakest recorded since mid-2013, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI. The gauge of sentiment among executives at 170 construction firms fell to 52.2 in December from 53.1 in November \u2013 worse than forecast by City economists \u2013 although still remained above the 50 level indicating expansion. The dip in the PMI reflected falling volumes of commercial work, offset by growing numbers of housebuilding projects. The prospect of greater workloads led firms to take on staff and buy materials at the fastest pace in two years over December. Strength in the housebuilding sector is likely to please government ministers trying to fix the country\u2019s housing crisis, after the Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year in the budget. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, also ploughed an additional \u00a310bn into the help-to-buy loan scheme and cut stamp duty for most first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said support from the government \u201cshould keep housebuilding motoring along\u201d in 2018, although warned construction output overall was likely to flatline. The full report is here: And here\u2019s more from IHS Markit\u2019s economist on the construction data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A construction sector slip did little for either the FTSE or pound this Wednesday morning. Like Tuesday\u2019s manufacturing figure, the most recent construction PMI fell short of expectations, coming in at 52.2 against the 52.8 forecast and the 53.1 seen in November. While neither of December\u2019s PMIs have been disastrous, there\u2019s nevertheless a slight whiff of disappointment that the robust levels seen in November couldn\u2019t last a bit longer. All this helped edge cable into the red, though even with a 0.2% decline the pound is still circling a 3 and a half month high against the dollar; against the euro it fared better, rising 0.1% as its rival gave back some of its recent growth (the euro\u2019s also down 0.3% against the greenback). The FTSE, meanwhile, strained to keep the right side of the red/green divide, the index struggling to shake its sluggish start to 2018 despite the newfound \u2013 if fragile \u2013 sense of optimism in the retail sector following Next\u2019s surprisingly solid Christmas figures. As for the Eurozone indices, with the euro taking a breather from the vertiginous climb seen in the last few weeks the DAX and CAC attempted to right yesterday\u2019s wrongs. Both the German and French indices rose 0.6%, allowing them to cross 12900 and 5300 respectively. The pound is holding up fairly well despite the weaker than expected UK construction data, with sterling down 0.18% against the dollar at $1.3562. But with underwhelming manufacturing figures on Tuesday following by these construction numbers, all eyes will be on the service sector data on Thursday for more insight into how the UK economy ended the year. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, said: Despite forecasts expecting an unchanged figure of 53.1, Construction PMI underwhelmed analysts after falling to 52.2 on the back of weaker housebuilding and a decline in commercial building. The pound was holding near yesterday\u2019s highs against a weak dollar in the early hours of trading this morning as investors awaited the data, but the currency appears to have been able to shrug off the weak figures. Following yesterday\u2019s unexpected dip in Manufacturing PMI and today\u2019s weaker Construction data, investors will be looking for signs to help strengthen confidence in the UK\u2019s economic outlook. As one of the strongest indicators of the health of the economy at the end of last year, analysts will be directing their attention to the release of Services PMI later this week. The markets could see a more notable reaction from sterling depending on the strength or weakness of the services sector, and following less than promising signs from data released so far, investors may be bracing themselves for some volatility should figures point to Brexit-based pressure on the economy ahead of a crucial year for negotiations. Back with the construction PMIs, Balraj Sroya, sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: After a subpar PMI figure from the manufacturing industry yesterday that slipped from four-year highs, today\u2019s construction PMI print followed suit, missing forecasts coming out at 52.2. While both sets of PMIs were above the crucial 50 level showing expansion in the sector, there was still doubt that stellar figures would be reached once again. Today\u2019s figure is weighed down by the moderate downturn in commercial projects combined with stagnated expansion in the home building sector. However, investors are still forecasting an increase in construction activity throughout 2018, which fuels views that the UK economy saw an unexpected slowdown at the end of 2017 and is expected to get back on track shortly. Tomorrow services PMI is being released, which is the largest sector in the UK and investors along with the Bank of England will be looking closely to see if this is a turning point for the UK economy and whether or not 2018 will be as prosperous as many think. The FTSE 100 has drifted lower after its initial gains thanks to UK retailers, and is now off 0.01%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE has continued to flounder on the second trading day of 2018, even though the US, Asian, and mainland European markets have pushed higher. The disappointing UK construction PMI forms the second disappointing UK PMI survey is as many days, with the pound drifting marginally lower as a result. Unfortunately, the weaker pound has done little to help the FTSE, which has been dragged lower thanks to yet another poor showing from the miners thanks to ripples in the recent gold and copper resurgence story. The UK services PMI reading is due on Thursday morning, and a third disappointing survey would provide yet another reason to sell the pound. More reaction to the UK construction data. Here is Investec\u2019s chief economist Philip Shaw: Max Jones, Global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: A downbeat PMI in December capped off a difficult year for construction firms. The great unknown is what this year holds and how the economy will react to the next phase of the Brexit negotiations. In the second half of last year, many construction businesses focused on shoring up their balance sheets, putting them in the best possible position to invest and ride out any turbulence. Looking ahead, there are several trends we expect to see play out in 2018, some a continuation of developments in recent years. Some firms will invest in tech and automation, helping a sector that is still quite old-fashioned to transition to a more productive future. Meanwhile, contractors will continue to focus on developing specialisms with an increasing reliance on fewer, bigger-spending clients in key sub-sectors. Another expectation is that we will see businesses make smaller, targeted acquisitions to fill in gaps in their expertise. But it is unlikely that a mega-merger is on the cards because of the inherent risk in combining balance sheets and order books. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit and author of the IHS Markit/CIPS Construction PMI said: The UK construction sector achieved a moderate expansion of business activity at the end of 2017, although the recovery remained uneven and slowed overall since November. Construction companies indicated that another strong contribution from house building helped to offset subdued civil engineering activity and reduced volumes of commercial work. Total new orders picked up at the fastest pace for seven months in December, which provides a positive signal for construction workloads in the short-term. Resilient demand and forthcoming project starts also led to greater job creation and the strongest increase in input buying for two years. However, construction firms indicated that longer- term business confidence is still relatively subdued, largely reflecting concerns about the domestic economic outlook. Exactly 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipate a reduction. As a result, the balance of UK construction companies expecting growth in the year ahead remains among the weakest recorded by the survey since mid-2013. Here\u2019s IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist: Growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector slowed down last month after forecasts of an unchanged figure. The December construction PMI came in at 52.2, down from a five month high of 53.1 and the first slowdown since September. Weaker growth in housebuilding and a fall in commercial building combined with slower infrastructure work to bring about the decline. But the new orders index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.1, according to IHS Markit, the highest since May 2017. Germany\u2019s unemployment figures have beaten analysts\u2019 forecasts. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 29,000 to 2.44m, compared to estimates of a 12,000 decrease. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.5% after November\u2019s reading was revised down from 5.6%. Here is our report on the Next figures. Sarah Butler writes: Next has raised hopes for the retail sector by revealing a better than expected Christmas, with strong online sales offsetting a fall at its high street stores. In a trading statement, the clothing and home chain said sales rose 1.5% in the 54 days to 24 December. A fall of 0.3% had been forecast. Shares in Next, the first major retailer to report on festive trading, jumped almost 10% in early trading. Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark-owner Associated British Foods were also up, rising about 3%, on hopes that they may also have fared better than expected. The retailer upgraded its profit expectations for the year to January by \u00a38m, to \u00a3725m, after sales benefited from the colder weather in the run up to Christmas. Profit guidance is now between \u00a3718m and \u00a3732m and performance will depend on the clearance sales in January. Next said that all its growth came online, where sales rose 13.6%. The chain\u2019s high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. That pattern is expected to be repeated across the retail sector as companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and House of Fraser next week reveal how they fared over the most important part of the trading year. The full story is here: Now for a quick look at our favourite cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is currently up nearly 3% at $15,083, continuing its New Year rebound. Naeem Aslam at Thinkmarkets said: Bitcoin has bounced back up after a Wall Street Journal report showed that a venture firm (which has a track record on betting on big firms like Airbnb and SpaceX) has been accumulating bitcoin and the fund may be holding approximately $20million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has crossed above the 15K mark, an important resistance level broken, and this opens the floor for Bitcoin to move towards the 20K mark (as long as it stays above 15K). Helped by Next\u2019s better than expected Christmas update, the FTSE 100 has opened higher, while European markets are also making a positive start. Next is up nearly 10%, while Primark owner Associated British Foods and Marks and Spencer are both around 3% better. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.11% while Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.4% higher ahead of the country\u2019s employment data and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Here\u2019s Alistair Davies of Investec on Next: Expect some share price relief that Christmas wasn\u2019t as bad as expected and no further downgrades. However, we would caution against reading too much across to other retail stocks \u2013 the reality is that even though Next\u2019s Christmas numbers are better than expected, the company has still had a tough Christmas. More on Next. The retailer has raised its full year profit forecast for 2018 after better than expected sales in the run-up to Christmas, with cold weather boosting demand for winter clothing. It now expects full year profits of \u00a3725m, up from its previous guidance of \u00a3717m but below the \u00a3790m it made the previous year. And it did warn of continuing challenges, not least from subdued consumer demand thanks to the squeeze on real incomes. The company\u2019s shares are expected to open higher after the update. But analysts at Beaufort Securities were unimpressed, issuing a sell note following the update and pointing out a profit downgrade for 2019: Next is an interesting beast, very cash generative, decent balance sheet (net debt of circa \u00a3950m), growing on line sales but declining sales in its shops. This morning\u2019s sales news is positive although nothing like a reversal of Next\u2019s long term high street decline. And the outlook statement is less positive, with FY19 profit guidance of \u00a3705m (down 3% on FY18 to Jan) and free cash (for divis and share buybacks) of \u00a3525m versus a market cap of \u00a36.57bn. Here are the opening calls for European markets from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After Tuesday\u2019s unspectacular UK manufacturing data - Britain\u2019s factories saw a slowdown in December but the performance was described as \u201csolid\u201d - comes the latest snapshot of the country\u2019s construction industry. Analysts are expecting an unchanged figure from November\u2019s 53.1. Also coming up are German unemployment figures which are forecast to show an improvement from November. Elsewhere the oil price has slipped back after the Iran protests pushed Brent to a peak of $67 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest level since May 2015. And European markets are expected to open higher in the main after Wall Street hit new records, although the FTSE 100 is forecast to be fairly flat. The strength of the pound against the dollar is likely to undermine the leading UK index, packed as it is with overseas earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. There are also some positive trading figures from Next for the Christmas period, the first indicator of how the high street performed over the festive period.

Exactly 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipate a reduction.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction industry is its least optimistic for five years amid fears over Brexit and an economic slowdown, according to a survey. Despite some pockets of strength as building firms won the most work for several months in December, the balance of companies expecting a rise in output levels over the next 12 months was the weakest recorded since mid-2013, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI. The gauge of sentiment among executives at 170 construction firms fell to 52.2 in December from 53.1 in November \u2013 worse than forecast by City economists, although remained above the 50 level indicating expansion. The dip in the PMI reflected falling volumes of commercial work, offset by growing numbers of housebuilding projects. The prospect of greater workloads led firms to take on staff and buy materials at the fastest pace in two years over December. Strength in the housebuilding sector is likely to please government ministers trying to fix the country\u2019s housing crisis, after the Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year in the budget. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, also ploughed an additional \u00a310bn into the help-to-buy loan scheme and cut stamp duty for most first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said support from the government \u201cshould keep housebuilding motoring along\u201d in 2018, although he warned construction output overall was likely to flatline. The rebound in orders in December picked up by the PMI survey comes as optimism among building firms evaporates, fuelled by fears over Brexit and the potential for a slowdown in economic growth. Little more than a third of firms in the survey see an increase in activity over the course of 2018, while 11% anticipate a reduction. Firms said they were facing strong cost pressures as a result of the weak pound in the wake of the Brexit vote driving up the cost of importing materials. The price of bricks, insulation and roofing tiles also increased. Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said: \u201cIt appears that the continued fall in commercial activity was testament to Brexit-related uncertainty on the horizon and the sector\u2019s fear about the direction of the UK economy as clients still hesitated to spend on bigger projects.\u201d",

The company said the Financial Conduct Authority had started an investigation into the \u201ctimeliness and content of announcements\u201d made by Carillion between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017. It added that it was cooperating fully with the FCA. Carillion\u2019s share price has collapsed from 240p at the start of last year, and tumbled a further 7.3% in early trading to 16.65p. The company, which is one of the firms working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line and the revamp of Battersea power station, has issued three profit warnings in five months after writedowns of more than \u00a31bn. Saddled with debts of \u00a31.6bn, it is looking for refinancing that will involve its lenders swapping their debt for shares. The contractor came close to breaching the terms on its lending last month, but lenders \u2013 led by HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 agreed to give it four months\u2019 extension. It now has until 30 April before its covenants will be tested. Carillion\u2019s chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down in July after the first profit warning and writedown. Its new boss, Andrew Davies, is taking over from the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, on 22 January, three months earlier than planned. The firm has worked on the expansion of Liverpool Football Club\u2019s main stand at Anfield, Birmingham\u2019s flagship library and the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital. Some of these projects have run into problems, including the Royal Liverpool. Carillion has also been affected by cuts in spending by governments in the Middle East prompted by low oil prices.

    "webTitle": "Apple leads race to become world's first $1tn company", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The race is on to become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company, with all eyes fixed on tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Financial commentators and investors predict 2018 will herald the first firm with a stock market valuation of $1tn (\u00a3738bn) or more, if technology share prices continue to rise as strongly as in 2017. Apple is leading the way, with a market valuation of $869bn on Tuesday, a figure arrived at by multiplying the company\u2019s share price by the number of shares in circulation. The Californian firm that transformed mobile communications, music and photography with the iPhone is $140bn ahead of Alphabet, which has a market value of $729bn. Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1997 when its founder, Steve Jobs, retook the helm, would require a 15% increase in its share price to tip over the $1tn threshold. Apple\u2019s shares increased by 47% last year. The shares were up 1.8% to $172.26 at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday after a dip in the last couple of weeks. Barron\u2019s, the US investment magazine, declared on its cover last week that Apple would hit the $1tn valuation this year and that \u201cwe don\u2019t think the peak [of Apple\u2019s rise] is near\u201d. Apple earned revenue of $229bn in its latest financial year, and made profits of $48bn \u2013 roughly as much as Microsoft and JP Morgan combined. David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, which manages $25bn worth of funds, told Barron\u2019s: \u201cYou have to go back to Rockefeller and Standard Oil to find a company so dominant in a business so large. Other companies settle for unit sales or revenues, but in many quarters, Apple collects more than 80% of gross profit across the smartphone industry.\u201d George Salmon, an equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said markets were forecast to continue their boom in 2018 and that it was \u201cjust a matter of time\u201d before one of the big US tech stocks tipped over into a trillion-dollar company. \u201cWith Facebook, Google and Amazon attracting an ever-increasing number of eyeballs on screen, the US tech sector has more than played its part in the global stock market rally,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s Apple, one of the older tech giants, that\u2019s in pole position to break through the $1tn barrier.\u201d Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said the creation of a trillion-dollar company was \u201cinevitable\u201d. \u201cIt may not happen this year, if we have a correction [fall in stock markets] but it is certain to happen over the next five years,\u201d he said. Microsoft is in third place with a valuation of $664bn, but some analysts reckon that the online retail juggernaut Amazon is far more likely to take the crown as the first $1tn company because it is growing so quickly. Amazon is the world\u2019s fourth most-valuable company with a market capitalisation of $566bn. Amazon\u2019s shares increased in value by 58% last year, turning the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, into the world\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $99bn. His fortune increased by $34bn last year. On just one day in October, Bezos\u2019s fortune increased by $10.3bn, when Amazon posted profits much higher than expected and the company\u2019s shares spiked. Facebook, which floated on the stock market less than six years ago, is in fifth place, with a valuation of $520bn. Shares in the social network rose 56% last year. The world\u2019s top five companies are collectively worth $3.35tn \u2013 more than than gross domestic product of the UK and every other country on Earth bar the US, China, Japan and Germany. The huge increase in valuations came after global stock markets ended 2017 at record highs, as share prices benefitted from President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and continued quantitative easing from central banks. Many analysts expect global stocks to continue to rise in 2018, which would be the ninth consecutive year of gains for the US S&amp;P 500 index. However, some are concerned that shares are overvalued and warn of a \u201ccorrection\u201d. Other market analysts and financial experts predict Amazon could beat Apple to the $1tn title.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A surge in music streaming via digital services including Spotify and Apple Music has prompted the fastest growth in UK music consumption since the late 1990s. UK consumers bought the equivalent of more than 135m albums last year across all formats \u2013 which include CDs, vinyl, digital downloads and streams from subscription services. That was a 9.5% increase on 2016, the biggest annual rise since 1998, when the charts were dominated by artists including All Saints, Massive Attack and the Verve. The growth in buying and listening to music was driven by audio streaming, which leaped by 51.5% to just over 68m albums and helped offset falling sales of digital downloads and CDs. Ed Sheeran was the most streamed artist after the release of his album Divide, and his Shape of You was also the most streamed individual track. For the first time more than half of the total number of albums bought and listened to were streamed, according to the latest figures from the UK music industry trade body, the British Phonographic Industry [BPI], based on data from the Official Charts Company. The value of music sales soared 10% to \u00a31.2bn, helping to lift the total value of the UK entertainment market to a new all-time high of \u00a37.2bn in 2017, its third consecutive year of growth after a decade of decline, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (Era). The continuing vinyl revival, which made turntables one of the must-have gadgets for 2017, also boosted sales. Hipsters, parents re-living their youth and young music fans searching for a more authentic sound together bought 4.1m vinyl albums \u2013 the highest number since 1991, when Simply Red\u2019s Stars topped the album chart and Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind was released. Sheeran\u2019s Divide was the top selling album on every format. Other vinyl topsellers for 2017 included Liam Gallagher\u2019s As You Were, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumours, which was originally released in 1977, and Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black from 2006. Not every format is on the increase: CD album sales dropped 12%, while downloads, using services such as iTunes and Amazon, dived 23.4%, according to the BPI and Official Charts Company. But cassette tapes also made a surprise comeback, registering a 43% rise in sales, as the soundtrack to the film Guardians of the Galaxy and the rock act Kasabian produced popular albums on the almost defunct format. However, the number of cassettes sold last year was still only 22,000. British artists dominated the top sellers, with eight of 2017\u2019s top 10 albums across all formats. The chart toppers ranged from Sheeran to Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, Sam Smith and Little Mix. The musical theatre star Michael Ball\u2019s latest album with the tenor Alfie Boe was also a top seller, alongside Stormzy and Liam Gallagher. Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of BPI, said the rise of strong British acts was driving the growth in demand, but he warned that long-term growth was reliant on the industry persuading all digital platforms to pay fairly for their use of music and government action to limit illegal sites. Kim Bayley, the chief executive officer of the Entertainment Retailers Association, said 24/7 access to music, video and games was driving demand for entertainment. \u201cIn the past the growth of the market tended to be dependent on the release schedules of games publishers, film studios and record labels. \u201cNow we are seeing a market also driven by digital platforms and technologies,\u201d Bayley said. Digital sales of films rose 22.2% last year, according to Era. That offset a 17% dive in sales of physical movie formats, such as DVD and Blu-ray, and the total value of the market rose 7.5% to \u00a32.7bn. Only \u00a340m was spent on DVD rental, down another 16% in just 12 months. The top selling film across all formats was Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast, ahead of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the musical animation Moana and JK Rowling\u2019s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, according to the Official Charts Company. Physical formats are still popular in the games market. Successful titles such as Fifa 18 and Call of Duty: WWII, as well as the launch of Nintendo\u2019s Switch device, lifted sales of console games for the first time in nine years. Total sales rose 9.6% to \u00a33.3bn. \u201cPhysical [formats] may no longer be the default option for many people that it once was, but it remains a substantial \u00a32bn business,\u201d said Bayley. \u201cWhere physical really comes into its own is where it offers something distinctive and additional to content, whether it is the tactile experience of vinyl or the simple fact that physical objects work well as gifts. I remain confident that physical entertainment formats will continue to be with us for years to come.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Successful titles such as Fifa 18 and Call of Duty: WWII, as well as the launch of Nintendo\u2019s Switch device, lifted sales of console games for the first time in nine years. Total sales rose 9.6% to \u00a33.3bn.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401a84f6c4bc0795a082e83a8fa259144edfb1d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401a84f6c4bc0795a082e83a8fa259144edfb1d6/33_0_3422_2053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from best-selling computer game Fifa 18\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from best-selling computer game Fifa 18.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA Sports/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPhysical [formats] may no longer be the default option for many people that it once was, but it remains a substantial \u00a32bn business,\u201d said Bayley.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere physical really comes into its own is where it offers something distinctive and additional to content, whether it is the tactile experience of vinyl or the simple fact that physical objects work well as gifts.
