    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The leadership of the Co-operative Group was accused of conducting an ill-designed attempt to destroy the Labour-affiliated Co-operative party after releasing a questionnaire asking the public whether it should continue to fund political parties. The criticism came after the Co-op Group launched a wide-ranging online survey asking whether it should continue making up to \u00a31m a year in political donations to the party. Peter Hunt, the former general secretary of the Co-op political party, which is allied with Labour and has 32 MPs, including the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, was sharply critical of the survey and questioned the movement's decision to carry out the poll. Hunt told the Guardian: \"The Co-operative party is completely dependent on the Co-op movement subscriptions for its funding. If they were withdrawn, it would mean its abolition, and that in turn would have consequences for the Labour party, and all small political parties, as well as changing the whole culture of politics in Britain.\" The survey also sees the Co-op Group, the organisation which owns supermarkets, pharmacies, funeral homes and farms, as well as 30% of the Co-op bank, ask the public whether it should pay a dividend to its members when profits allow, and what it can do to help local communities following a series of scandals inside its banking arm. The bank's failed bid to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group caused a political furore, and was followed by allegations that Paul Flowers, the former chairman of the bank and a member of the main group board, had been involved in buying illegal drugs. Hunt said: \"To launch these questions at a time when the Co-operative movement has so many other problems on its hands is strange, especially as there has been no discussion of this issue anywhere else.\" The Co-op Group took out a series of adverts in many major newspapers on Monday to launch the consultation. Euan Sutherland, who became chief executive last May, said: \"In recent years the Co-operative has lost touch with its customers and members and with the communities in which it operates \u2013 we haven't been listening.\" He admitted that full-year 2013 figures, which will be released next month, would be \"pretty ugly\". The group reported a \u00a3599m loss in August, and just before Christmas suspended its dividend to members. There is a widespread view that the Co-op movement is burdened with too large a board, including many directly elected members. This governance structure has led some to argue that it failed to spot the error of appointing the now disgraced Paul Flowers as chairman of the Co-op Bank, who stepped down in the wake of the drug allegations. The results of the online survey will be published with Sutherland's strategic review at the annual meeting in mid-May. The questionnaire asks: \"To what extent do you think it is appropriate or inappropriate for big businesses to donate money to political parties?\" Other questions concern how the Co-op should distribute profits, its role in the community, and how to improve goods and services. In 2012 the Co-op donated a total of \u00a3805,000 to the Co-operative party and its councillors. This included donations to 32 Labour and Co-operative MPs, as well as a one-off \u00a350,000 grant to the office of the shadow cabinet. Sutherland said: \"If we get an overwhelming response that says customers don't see the link between funding a political party, it will be impossible for us not to take action and to ignore it.\" It then asks: \"The Co-operative is a financial supporter of the Co-operative party, which fields candidates in UK national, devolved and local elections in partnership with the Labour party. Were you aware of this before today?\" It then asks those taking the survey whether they agree with a range of statements. One says, \"The Co-operative should first use its money to lower its prices before it considers providing funding for a political party.\" A second says: \"It is inappropriate for the Co-operative to give financial support to a political party.\" The only option to support the financial link is in the statement \"It makes me more likely to purchase goods or services from the Co-operative.\"",

With the Troika poised to return as early as this week, Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Greece\u2019s political landscape becoming ever more tense ahead of euro elections in May, officials tonight are expressing consternation at the reluctance of creditor states to discuss what the country needs most: debt relief as soon as possible. One insider with close ties to the inner workings of prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition, said: \u201cwe are constantly getting mixed messages. The feeling is, that partly as a result of tensions with [auditors representing] the troika, they are acting in bad faith.\u201d</p> <p>Putting an end to speculation that creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF would agree to some form of debt forgiveness before the European parliament poll, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem who heads the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told reporters earlier today that any decision would be made \u201cafter the summer.\u201d </p> <p>While Greece\u2019s monumental debt load \u2013 at 176 % of GDP widely accepted as the root of the country\u2019s fiscal woes \u2013 \u201chas to be reduced,\u201d Dijsselbloem insisted there was no urgency as under its current \u20ac240bn bailout programme, Athens\u2019 financing needs would be covered through the summer. The Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, has repeatedly reminded the country\u2019s creditors of their promise to extend debt relief once Athens achieved a primary surplus which he says it attained in 2013 and is on course to officially reveal in April. </p> <p>In an interview with the Sunday Vima, the Greek prime minister went further estimating that Greece would post a primary surplus of \u20ac1.5bn \u2013 almost twice the \u20ac831m originally envisaged - describing it not only as being earlier than expected but \u201cofficial and huge.\u201d</p> <p>Contradicting suggestions made by German Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble that plans were underway for a third bailout, Samaras has also denied that the country requires more aid. Last week he told the mass-selling Bild newpaper: \u201cWe do not need a new, third aid program. We are reaching the goals of our current program and it is showing results.\u201d </p> <p>A debt write-down would be seen as a major coup for a government that has become increasingly fragile as unemployment and poverty soars.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5302418ce4b086afb98103d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-17T17:06:37.846Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that appears to be that for the Eurogroup press conference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/statuses/435459425693089792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>What&#39;s pretty clear from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Eurogroup&amp;src=hash\">#Eurogroup</a> presser is that there&#39;s no agreement on timetable for deciding more bailout cash for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Greece&amp;src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>&mdash;

Letta\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d, which took office in April, has already changed shape because of the split in the centre-right that created the New Centre Right (NCD) party. Despite the coalition\u2019s legislative majority, policies like those in the draft 2014 budget reflected political bargaining and disputes between and within the major political parties. </p> <p>It is not yet clear what continuity there will be between Renzi\u2019s administration and Letta\u2019s. NCD leader Angelino Alfano has said that negotiations on a new government\u2019s composition and policy programme should not be rushed. Although the PD largely backed Renzi\u2019s challenge, it is not certain that he will receive full support on policy, especially in the upper house. </p> <p>So even if there is a quicker political reconfiguration than last spring, the new prime minister will probably face similar challenges to his predecessor in building and holding together a government that can agree and enact reforms that, Fitch believes, would boost Italian economic competitiveness and growth, and comply with EU and Italian fiscal rules. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full statement is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/fitchwire/fitchwirearticle/Italian-PM-Change?pr_id=820755&amp;cm_sp=homepage-_-FitchWire-_-%20Italian%20PM%20Change%20Highlights%20Political%20Volatility\">Italian PM Change Highlights Political Volatility</a></h2>  <p>You may remember that Italy\u2019s credit rating was raised to stable from negative by another agency, Moody\u2019s, after markets closed on Friday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-17T15:50:02.899Z\">at 3.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5302275fe4b09e6e9779f9b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-17T15:21:39.557Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Francois Hollande has been busy trying to woo foreign businesses to invest in France, offering them simpler and more stable tax policies.</b></p> <p>The French president has been hosting 30 heads of the French operations of foreign companies at the Elysee Palace and pledged that taxes on an investment would not later rise, as had happened in the past.

Most economists are expecting the economy to pick up in early 2014, but drop back following the introduction of a sales tax in April.<br></p> <p><br><b>Takumi Tsunoda at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, Tokyo</b><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth will almost certainly accelerate in January-March because of last-minute buying ahead of the tax hike so the question is what happens in the following quarters and that\u2019s where opinions among investors are divided.</p> <p>We think consumption will be hurt after April. Optimists say the last time the sales tax was raised in 1997, consumption stumbled not because of the tax hike but because of a financial crisis.But at that time, wages were growing 1.5%. Today wages are up just 0.4%. So the negative impact on consumers\u2019 real purchasing power will be bigger this time.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><b>Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute Tokyo</b><br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pace of the economic recovery was not as strong as previously expected, as the pickup in exports is slow.But domestic demand remains strong and there will be a rush of demand before the sales tax goes up in April. So we will probably see growth in January-March data and the economy will likely continue to grow after the sales tax hike if demand from overseas grows.</p> <p>I don`t think the Bank of Japan will adopt additional easing steps as domestic demand is strong and prices are steadily increasing, and as long as the markets are stable. The economy has not yet been derailed from its main scenario. The focus will be on how exports recover.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In terms of the breakdown of GDP, the story was, however, a little less miserable, with evidence of an increase in domestic demand, helping offset a limp export performance, and suggesting that at least the current fairly slow rates of growth should be sustainable, and not totally reliant on yen weakness.</p> <p>But with the consumption tax hike in April, we really will need to see spending figures picking up more strongly, even if only representing front-loading, and failing a strong boost here, the arguments for the BoJ to provide a further dollop of yen weakness through some pre-emptive expansion of QE looks to be gathering strength.

The closing scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 72.38 points or 1.09% at 6736.00 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.06% to 9656.76 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.11% lower at 4335.17 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 20,459.65 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex slipped 0.14% to 10,118.6 \u2022 The Athens market dipped 0.28% to 1276.81 And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In Greece, the eurogroup\u2019s decision to put off negotiations on whether to extend a third financial package of the country and write off at least some of its debt is causing consternation. With the Troika poised to return as early as this week, Helena Smith reports: With Greece\u2019s political landscape becoming ever more tense ahead of euro elections in May, officials tonight are expressing consternation at the reluctance of creditor states to discuss what the country needs most: debt relief as soon as possible. One insider with close ties to the inner workings of prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition, said: \u201cwe are constantly getting mixed messages. The feeling is, that partly as a result of tensions with [auditors representing] the troika, they are acting in bad faith.\u201d Putting an end to speculation that creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF would agree to some form of debt forgiveness before the European parliament poll, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem who heads the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told reporters earlier today that any decision would be made \u201cafter the summer.\u201d While Greece\u2019s monumental debt load \u2013 at 176 % of GDP widely accepted as the root of the country\u2019s fiscal woes \u2013 \u201chas to be reduced,\u201d Dijsselbloem insisted there was no urgency as under its current \u20ac240bn bailout programme, Athens\u2019 financing needs would be covered through the summer. The Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, has repeatedly reminded the country\u2019s creditors of their promise to extend debt relief once Athens achieved a primary surplus which he says it attained in 2013 and is on course to officially reveal in April. In an interview with the Sunday Vima, the Greek prime minister went further estimating that Greece would post a primary surplus of \u20ac1.5bn \u2013 almost twice the \u20ac831m originally envisaged - describing it not only as being earlier than expected but \u201cofficial and huge.\u201d Contradicting suggestions made by German Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble that plans were underway for a third bailout, Samaras has also denied that the country requires more aid. Last week he told the mass-selling Bild newpaper: \u201cWe do not need a new, third aid program. We are reaching the goals of our current program and it is showing results.\u201d A debt write-down would be seen as a major coup for a government that has become increasingly fragile as unemployment and poverty soars. And that appears to be that for the Eurogroup press conference. The Eurogroup moves on to Greece and Cyprus: And Italy, in the wake of the recent political change: And on banking union, don\u2019t hold your breath: International inspectors are to return to Greece in the coming days, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloen has said. In a press conference currently underway (live stream here) following the Eurogroup meeting, he also said he was confident of getting an agreement from eurozone ministers in March on direct bank recapitalisation via the European Stability Mechanism. Meanwhile Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, is also speaking on Greece. He said the country\u2019s fiscal outcome for 2013 might be better than expected, although this would have to wait for verification from Eurostat. Ratings agency Fitch said the change of power in Italy highlighted the volatility of the country\u2019s politics: Uncertainty about the durability of governments and their capacity for structural reform and fiscal consolidation is one reason for the Negative Outlook on Italy\u2019s \u2018BBB+\u2019 rating. This is the latest episode of political volatility since last February\u2019s inconclusive parliamentary elections (increased political uncertainty, combined with the depth of Italy\u2019s recession, prompted our downgrade to \u2018BBB+\u2019 in March). Letta\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d, which took office in April, has already changed shape because of the split in the centre-right that created the New Centre Right (NCD) party. Despite the coalition\u2019s legislative majority, policies like those in the draft 2014 budget reflected political bargaining and disputes between and within the major political parties. It is not yet clear what continuity there will be between Renzi\u2019s administration and Letta\u2019s. NCD leader Angelino Alfano has said that negotiations on a new government\u2019s composition and policy programme should not be rushed. Although the PD largely backed Renzi\u2019s challenge, it is not certain that he will receive full support on policy, especially in the upper house. So even if there is a quicker political reconfiguration than last spring, the new prime minister will probably face similar challenges to his predecessor in building and holding together a government that can agree and enact reforms that, Fitch believes, would boost Italian economic competitiveness and growth, and comply with EU and Italian fiscal rules. The full statement is here: Italian PM Change Highlights Political Volatility You may remember that Italy\u2019s credit rating was raised to stable from negative by another agency, Moody\u2019s, after markets closed on Friday. Francois Hollande has been busy trying to woo foreign businesses to invest in France, offering them simpler and more stable tax policies. The French president has been hosting 30 heads of the French operations of foreign companies at the Elysee Palace and pledged that taxes on an investment would not later rise, as had happened in the past. According to Reuters: The socialist president, who last month announced France would phase out \u20ac30bn in charges on companies by 2017 to reverse its slide in trade competitiveness, also said French business taxes would be harmonised with those of its neighbours, especially Germany, by 2020. The global economy will continue to grow despite choppiness in emerging markets and worries about Chinese growth. That is the upbeat message from the Bundesbank, in its latest monthly report (German). Germany\u2019s central bank said China\u2019s economy was set to continue growing without much disruption, despite interest rate rises as central banks in some emerging economies attempt to curb capital outflows and currency falls, amid jitters about the withdrawal of US stimulus. Even if this should slow the economic growth of the countries concerned, their low global weight means it is not to be expected that the recovery of the world economy will be appreciably affected. The bank also noted that economic growth had \u201cincreased appreciably\u201d in the final quarter of 2013 and the first of 2014, noting \u201calmost continual improvement\u201d in companies\u2019 and households\u2019 assessment of the economy. However, this should only fully show up in the GDP growth rates at the turn of the year, when the increased order inflow translates into production. On that note, I am passing over to Nick Fletcher, who will run the blog for the rest of today. Thank you for all your comments so far. Libor update (see further 12.14): The three ex-Barclays men charged with manipulating the Libor rate are due to appear in court on 26 February. Two of them, Peter Charles Johnson and Jonathan James Mathew, were Libor submitters, while Stylianos Contouglas was a trader. Sad news: WH Smith has scrapped many of its honesty boxes because of customer \u201cmisuse\u201d, various newspapers report Installed in some of WH Smith\u2019s busiest locations, such as stations and airports, the boxes were intended to help time-poor commuters avoid the queues to buy a newspaper. Now the retailer has been forced to abandon the scheme in a third of branches running the scheme, having found that people are filling the boxes with rubbish, foreign coins and bits of chewing gum. One expert thinks some of the problems could have been avoided if the retailer had included a picture of eyes near the boxes. Dr Melissa Bateson studied shoppers\u2019 behaviour when a poster of a pair of eyes was placed above an honesty box. We got nearly three times as much money. Eyes give people the feeling they are being watched. France and Germany will try to revive the European transactions tax, or Robin Hood tax, according to Reuters. The two countries, the power players of the European Union, will hold a joint cabinet meeting on Wednesday, where the plan is likely to be discussed. Soundings will also be taken on the sidelines of the regular monthly meeting of the EU finance ministers in Brussels this afternoon. Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for the talks, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, said: I hope that we take a step forward on that. We may possibly have to move ahead step by step. European proposals for a transactions tax - a 0.1% levy on trading in bonds and equities that would throw grit into wheels of international finance - have been kicking around since the start of the financial crisis, but agreement remains distant. A group of 11 countries - including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, but not the UK - have signed up for the tax, but been unable to agree how to implement it. Now Socialist MEPS are mobilising to support the plan. In a letter to eurozone finance ministers, they write: We count on you to reject the special pleading of vested interests and to do what is right for our citizens and the sustainability of a robust financial sector. Apologies for the error messages you may be finding when you click on links on the blog. We are trying to fix this problem. Update: the problem is fixed, but please bear with us while all the bad ones are replaced. A few more details on Ewald Nowotny\u2019s speech that has been causing a stir. On the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, he said it was less significant than it was: [The programme] not that relevant anymore because we have a substantial improvement in the European situation and there are no expectations in the market of a break-up in the euro zone. On interest rates, he said the bank needed more information about inflation and growth before taking a decision. Rates were left on hold earlier this month. There might be good arguments to say let\u2019s wait and see. On the eurozone recovery, the eurozone still faces downside risks, mainly from turmoil in financial markets, disinflation and the slow pace of implementation of structural reforms. It\u2019s good news that we see improvements in the real economy and how this connects to inflation rates is something that still needs to be discussed. So the euro-crisis is over? That appears to be the message from the European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny, who has said the ECB\u2019s bond buying programme is \u201cnot that relevant\u201d any more because of the improved economic situation. This comes 18 months after ECB president Mario Draghi made that big promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Job done? I\u2019ll try and track down more details from Nowotny\u2019s speech, but meantime, here are details, comment from Twitter. PA has more details on the SFO\u2019s case against three ex-employees of Barclays for alleged manipulation of the Libor interest rate. The men were named as Peter Charles Johnson, Jonathan James Mathew and Stylianos Contouglas. They are accused of conspiracy to defraud between June 1 2005 and August 31 2007 and will appear at London\u2019s Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on a date to be notified. The SFO said the investigation into Libor is continuing. The Serious Fraud Office has started criminal proceedings against three former employees of Barclays Bank for alleged manipulation of Libor interest rates. In 2012 Barclays was fined a record \u00a3290m for fixing Libor and admitted its actions \u201cfell well short of standards\u201d. Former chief executive Bob Diamond was even moved to give up his bonus. More to follow... Just days after the British government decided to ask the European Union for financial aid to deal with the floods, the UK is on the receiving end of more EU largesse. Our friends at Fast FT report that the European Investment Bank, the EU bank, will invest \u00a31bn a year in housing in the UK to help tackle the affordability crisis. The paper reports that the EIB aims to provide \u00a31bn a year in cheap loans to fund affordable housing, as part of its mandate to improve economic and social cohesion. Last year, EIB lending to the UK hit a record \u00a34.9bn, going primarily to water and energy infrastructure, rail and port facilities, new hospitals and higher and further education. Read the FT report here. We know that Renzi met Italian president Giorgio Napolitano for 90 minutes. In the next few days, the centre-left leader will need to agree a formal coalition deal with the small centre-right NCD party to secure a governing majority and name his cabinet before seeking a formal vote of confidence in parliament later this week. This puts him on course to become Italy\u2019s youngest prime minister since the war - quite a record for a man who has never been elected to parliament or served in a government. He declined to comment on who would make-up his cabinet, saying his attention was on content and not \u201cother issues\u201d. No big reaction from markets so far: Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is flat at 20,436, having lost earlier gains. From the wires: Matteo Renzi, just confirmed as Italy\u2019s new prime minister designate, will start consultations on a new cabinet on Tuesday. Plans for electoral reform will follow later this month, with further blueprints for reform to follow: labour reform in March, public administration in April and tax in May. It looks like it is official... While we wait for Italy\u2019s new prime minister to emerge from the presidential palace, check out this fun guide to 8 things you probably didn\u2019t know about Matteo Renzi. The risk that the eurozone could be entering a period of deflation remains a clear and present danger, with statistics showing that Greek consumer prices continued to fall in January. Prices fell by 1.2% in January on the previous month according to El.Stat, although the pace of deflation slackened off. In November Greek deflation was its worst ever since records began in 1960 and prices have now dropped steadily for 11 months in a row. European energy consumption fell by 8% between 2006 and 2012, according to data released this morning by Eurostat. Unsurprisingly, the five largest consumers of energy were Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Spain, accounting for almost two thirds of total consumption and three quarters of the reduction in energy. Also striking, some of the biggest falls in consumption took place in countries hardest hit by the economic crisis: Portugal\u2019s energy consumption dropped by 15.2% over the period, and Greece by 14.4%. A mixed picture on European stock markets this morning, with the FTSE100 pulling ahead, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index is not far off the five-year high it hit in January. Market watchers think a surge in Chinese bank lending is bolstering sentiment. The other big indices look flat, while Italy is slightly up as investors await the announcement of a mandate for Matteo Renzi. FTSE 100 +0.75% at 6,713 points Pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index +0.2% at 1,334 points France\u2019s CAC40 -0.08% at 4336 points Germany\u2019s DAX -0.01% at 9,661 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB +0.06% at 20,447 points No limo for him. Matteo Renzi arrives for his meeting with Italy\u2019s president Giorgio Napolitano. And the scene that awaited him. The sumptuous press room... Soon to get underway in Brussels: European economic policymakers and a smattering of politicians will debate \u201cthe eurozone area at a crossroads: policies for growth, jobs and competitiveness\u201d. The agenda (local time) 10:30-10:45: Opening remarks by Angel Gurr\u00eda, Secretary General of the OECD 10:45-11:00: Remarks by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of the Eurogroup 11:00-11:45: Panel discussion: Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the OECD Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque, minister of state and finance of Portugal Luis de Guindos, minister of economy and competitiveness of Spain Michael Noonan, minister for finance of Ireland The full seminar can be watched live here. That will be a prelude to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers this afternoon and all 28 ministers of the EU on Tuesday. I\u2019ll keep an eye on what is going on... Some useful polling data from Ipsos Italia via Electionista: Only 31% of Italians believe the decision to replace Enrico Letta with Matteo Renzi is positive 26% say it is pointless 23% wrong 15% absurd Matteo Renzi is likely to be named as Italy\u2019s next prime minister in a matter of minutes. We are expecting the news at 9.30 GMT (10.30 local time), following his meeting with Italian president Giorgio Napolitano. Renzi has already had some good economic news. Italian bond yields have fallen close to an 8-yr low this morning following a decision to lift its credit outlook by the rating agency Moody\u2019s. Italy\u2019s credit rating was raised to stable from negative by Moody\u2019s after markets closed on Friday. Dietmar Hornung, associate managing director at Moody\u2019s in Frankfurt, told Bloomberg that the agency saw \u201csignificant resilience in the government\u2019s financial strength\u201d with more stability across Europe providing a tailwind. However, described prospects for growth as quite subdued. While Michael Hewson at CMC Markets points out that despite the political turbulence, Italy\u2019s main index the FTSEMib has hit its highest levels since 2011. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary and adviser to Barack Obama, has said inequality is putting the US on its way to becoming a Downton Abbey economy. Here is a flavour of his argument - made in an opinion piece in the Washington Post and Financial Times (\u00a3). The share of income going to the top 1 per cent of earners has increased sharply. A rising share of output is going to profits. Real wages are stagnant. Family incomes have not risen as fast as productivity. The cumulative effect of all these developments is that the US may well be on the way to becoming a Downton Abbey economy. It is very likely that these issues will be with us long after the cyclical conditions have normalised and budget deficits have at last been addressed. President Barack Obama is right to be concerned. Those who condemn him for \u201ctearing down the wealthy\u201d and engaging in un-American populism are, to put it politely, lacking in historical perspective. Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Harry Truman railed against the excesses of a privileged few in finance and business... All were reacting in their own way to a phenomenon that Bill Clinton has described best: \u201cAlthough America\u2019s rich got richer ... the country did not ... the stock market tripled but wages went down.\u201d He also points out that \u201cthose who profess the most enthusiasm for market forces\u201d happen to be least enthusiastic about curbing tax benefits for the wealthy. A sharp increase in inequality, the top 1% getting richer, real wages flat: it doesn\u2019t sound a million miles away.... There is a fair amount of reaction to the disappointing growth data from Japan. Most economists are expecting the economy to pick up in early 2014, but drop back following the introduction of a sales tax in April. Takumi Tsunoda at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, Tokyo Growth will almost certainly accelerate in January-March because of last-minute buying ahead of the tax hike so the question is what happens in the following quarters and that\u2019s where opinions among investors are divided. We think consumption will be hurt after April. Optimists say the last time the sales tax was raised in 1997, consumption stumbled not because of the tax hike but because of a financial crisis.But at that time, wages were growing 1.5%. Today wages are up just 0.4%. So the negative impact on consumers\u2019 real purchasing power will be bigger this time. Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute Tokyo The pace of the economic recovery was not as strong as previously expected, as the pickup in exports is slow.But domestic demand remains strong and there will be a rush of demand before the sales tax goes up in April. So we will probably see growth in January-March data and the economy will likely continue to grow after the sales tax hike if demand from overseas grows. I don`t think the Bank of Japan will adopt additional easing steps as domestic demand is strong and prices are steadily increasing, and as long as the markets are stable. The economy has not yet been derailed from its main scenario. The focus will be on how exports recover. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING In terms of the breakdown of GDP, the story was, however, a little less miserable, with evidence of an increase in domestic demand, helping offset a limp export performance, and suggesting that at least the current fairly slow rates of growth should be sustainable, and not totally reliant on yen weakness. But with the consumption tax hike in April, we really will need to see spending figures picking up more strongly, even if only representing front-loading, and failing a strong boost here, the arguments for the BoJ to provide a further dollop of yen weakness through some pre-emptive expansion of QE looks to be gathering strength. Recent comments from BoJ Governor, Kuroda, however, give no hint of this. First two quotes via Reuters in Tokyo Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. And it is a disappointing start to the week in Japan, with data showing its economy grew well below expectations at the end of last year. Official figures show the economy expanded by 0.3% in October-December 2013, significantly down on the 0.7% that economists had hoped for. Weak export growth is being blamed, but private consumption and business investment were also worse than expected, raising questions about the limits of Abenomics - prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s unprecedented stimulus plan. Those who like the glass half full, would point out this was the fourth successive quarter of growth for the Japanese economy, its best run in more than three years. The bad news from Japan could subdue European markets in early trading. In Europe, another day; another Italian prime minister. Matteo Renzi, the mayor of Florence, is expected to be sworn in as prime minister this morning, making the 39-year old the youngest person to hold the post since the war. Also worth watching is a European Central Bank meeting, where eurozone bank supervisors will gather in Frankfurt to discuss the next phase of stress tests. I\u2019ll be following that and all the latest economic and business news...",

They are also offering 80 cents for the company's convertible bonds. But not all shareholders were happy with the \u00a3900m proposal, given that Essar floated in 2010 at 420p a share. Standard Life Investments fumed that the bid, from the Ruia's Essar Global Fund, was a piece of \"cynical opportunism.\" In a statement head of equities David Cumming said:</p> <blockquote> Essar Global's potential attempt to buy out the minority shareholder position in Essar Energy, capitalising on a technically depressed share price, is a calculated attempt to deprive minority shareholders of the substantial future upside in Essar Energy's valuation. <br> This potential bid is an example of cynical opportunism and should not be allowed to proceed. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 72.38 points higher at 6736.00, a new three and a half week high. The market took its lead from Asia, where shares moved higher despite disappointing Japanese growth data and following positive Chinese bank lending figures. But with half term in the UK and the US closed for the President's Day public holiday, it was a fairly subdued session.</p> <p>The continuing bounce in the gold price lifted <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> 83p to \u00a348.57 and <strong>Polymetal International </strong>26.5p to 684p.</p> <p>Other miners were supported by the Chinese data, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> adding 32.5p to \u00a315.52 and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> 23.5p better at \u00a319.12.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> Chinese bank lending data for January rose to its highest level since 2010, raising expectations that the Chinese economy could start to show signs of a rebound now that we've moved beyond Chinese New Year. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> rose 2.35p to 98.2p on hopes a disposal programme and cash call will put it back on track under new chief executive Stephen Hester.</p> <p>Analysts believe it could announce a rights issue of up to \u00a3350m when it updates the City on 27 February. The insurer is also reported to be considering a number of disposals, the latest suggestion being a \u00a3200m sale of a network of regional brokers in Canada.</p> <p>Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, was brought in to rebuild the business after an accounting scandal in Ireland.</p> <p>But the continuing extreme weather is likely to cost the company a substantial amount, which will hardly help the turnaround.</p> <p>Housebuilding shares benefited from more evidence of rising prices, with <strong>Persimmon</strong> putting on 30p to \u00a314.15 and <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> climbing 8.5p to 417.3p.</p> <p><strong>Hammerson</strong> - now a purely retail property developer after completing the disposal of its office properties - was 17p higher at 560.5p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after it said full year net asset value rose 5.7% to 573p and profits climbed from \u00a3142m to \u00a3341m.

The contract is worth \u00a3325m over nine years. But Liberum analysts kept their sell rating on Capita:</p> <blockquote> Capita was expected to have won this award, but it the outcome was contested over the New Year by BT. The contract is worth \u00a336m revenue per annum, adding 0.8% to pro forma organic growth. However, the contract starts off with a lower contribution of \u00a315m per annum, or around 0.4% to incremental organic growth. Capita has now won two of the three material bids it flagged at the third quarter (Congestion Charge and SWAN).

      "bodyText": "A controversial takeover plan has sent a charge through shares of Essar Energy but shocked some of its shareholders. The power plant and oil refining company, controlled by India's billionaire Ruia brothers, jumped 2.15p or more than 3% to 68.15p after they said they were considering a 70p a share offer for the remaining 22% of the company. They are also offering 80 cents for the company's convertible bonds. But not all shareholders were happy with the \u00a3900m proposal, given that Essar floated in 2010 at 420p a share. Standard Life Investments fumed that the bid, from the Ruia's Essar Global Fund, was a piece of \"cynical opportunism.\" In a statement head of equities David Cumming said: Essar Global's potential attempt to buy out the minority shareholder position in Essar Energy, capitalising on a technically depressed share price, is a calculated attempt to deprive minority shareholders of the substantial future upside in Essar Energy's valuation. This potential bid is an example of cynical opportunism and should not be allowed to proceed. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 72.38 points higher at 6736.00, a new three and a half week high. The market took its lead from Asia, where shares moved higher despite disappointing Japanese growth data and following positive Chinese bank lending figures. But with half term in the UK and the US closed for the President's Day public holiday, it was a fairly subdued session. The continuing bounce in the gold price lifted Randgold Resources 83p to \u00a348.57 and Polymetal International 26.5p to 684p. Other miners were supported by the Chinese data, with Anglo American adding 32.5p to \u00a315.52 and BHP Billiton 23.5p better at \u00a319.12. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Chinese bank lending data for January rose to its highest level since 2010, raising expectations that the Chinese economy could start to show signs of a rebound now that we've moved beyond Chinese New Year. RSA Insurance rose 2.35p to 98.2p on hopes a disposal programme and cash call will put it back on track under new chief executive Stephen Hester. Analysts believe it could announce a rights issue of up to \u00a3350m when it updates the City on 27 February. The insurer is also reported to be considering a number of disposals, the latest suggestion being a \u00a3200m sale of a network of regional brokers in Canada. Hester, the former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, was brought in to rebuild the business after an accounting scandal in Ireland. But the continuing extreme weather is likely to cost the company a substantial amount, which will hardly help the turnaround. Housebuilding shares benefited from more evidence of rising prices, with Persimmon putting on 30p to \u00a314.15 and Barratt Developments climbing 8.5p to 417.3p. Hammerson - now a purely retail property developer after completing the disposal of its office properties - was 17p higher at 560.5p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after it said full year net asset value rose 5.7% to 573p and profits climbed from \u00a3142m to \u00a3341m. Its Value Retail business, which operates luxury outlet villages in the UK and Europe including Bicester in Oxfordshire and La Vallee near Paris, saw double digit sales growth. Analysts at Liberum issued a buy note with a 617p price target, Outsourcing group Capita climbed 12p to \u00a310.62 after it won a contract for the Scottish wide area network, a single system to be used by all public service organisations in Scotland. The contract is worth \u00a3325m over nine years. But Liberum analysts kept their sell rating on Capita: Capita was expected to have won this award, but it the outcome was contested over the New Year by BT. The contract is worth \u00a336m revenue per annum, adding 0.8% to pro forma organic growth. However, the contract starts off with a lower contribution of \u00a315m per annum, or around 0.4% to incremental organic growth. Capita has now won two of the three material bids it flagged at the third quarter (Congestion Charge and SWAN). The outcome of the larger DIO (defence infrastructure) contract is still not known/decided, although Serco are still allegedly favourite. No change to our forecasts or sell rating. Oriel however was more positive, with a buy rating: These wins support the group's recent run of materially ahead of a one in two win rate. We value the group at 1170p a share, assuming mid-term organic growth of 6% a year and \u00a3200m of expenditure on acquisitive growth for the next several years. Rolls-Royce was still under pressure following last week's disappointing update, down 19p to \u00a310.06. Elsewhere Dixons Retail added 1.37p to 48.4p after acting to ease concerns about the competitive threat of soon to be floated Appliances Online. AO is expected to have a valuation of some \u00a31bn when it joins the stock market, and news of its plans have put pressure on Dixons. But over the weekend Dixons hit back with a presentation addressing concerns about its market share and competitive position. The news prompted a buy note from analysts at Barclays.",

But he said: \"I think growth is in strong double digits, similar to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/aldi\" title=\"\">Aldi</a> and Lidl [which stand at 32% and 17% respectively].\"</p> <p>In the same 12 weeks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\" title=\"\">Morrisons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\" title=\"\">Tesco</a> saw sales fall, according to Kantar Worldpanel. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/asda\" title=\"\">Asda's</a> sales rose just 0.5% \u2013 below the 2.4% growth achieved by the market as a whole.</p> <p>It is not just in groceries where shoppers' pursuit of a bargain has favoured price-cutters recently. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/poundland-discount-retail\" title=\"\">Poundland</a> is expected to confirm plans to float on the London stock market this week. The low-price retailer chaired by Tesco's former finance director Andy Higginson is expected to seek a total valuation of about \u00a3750m. B&amp;M, a discount retailer set up in Blackpool with just \u00a3750 in 1978, is also preparing for a stock market flotation that could value it at \u00a32bn.</p> <p>Beginning as a humble meat processor in 1955, Farmfoods opened its first experimental shop in Aberdeen in the early 1970s. It did not step outside its Scottish birthplace until the 1990s, but has gradually crept as far south as Plymouth in Devon. Today it has more than 320 stores and recent adverts have been fronted by Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits for 2012 were up 10% to \u00a327m and the company handed out a \u00a310.2m dividend to its shareholders \u2013 nearly all members of the founding Herd family. That payout was up from \u00a36.8m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House.</p> <p>The major shareholder is also the boss and son of the founder. Eric Herd may be enjoying the fruits of his business, having collected about \u00a38m of the last reported dividend, but he remains media shy. The bespectacled, golf-loving Scotsman sticks to touring his stores and getting involved in the detail of the business, politely turning away interview requests.</p> <p>The director-general of the <a href=\"http://bfff.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Frozen Food Federation</a>, Brian Young, describes Herd as a \"canny Scotsman\". He said: \"He really understands frozen food. He could give you a story about each of his products.\"</p> <p>It is his eye-catching deals, such as four litres of milk for \u00a31.60 and 30 frozen pork steaks for \u00a310, that are drawing in shoppers rather than rapidly opening stores.</p> <p>An analyst at <a href=\"http://www.verdictretail.com/\" title=\"\">Verdict Research</a>, Andy Stevens, said: \"It's about more people shopping there. They may not get the greatest product quality, but [Farmfoods] is appealing to the sort of customer who is really value-driven.\"</p> <p>All the frozen food retailers have been enjoying strong growth throughout the UK's economic downturn. Apart from the inherently lower cost of frozen food, which is cheaper to transport and store than fresh, Farmfoods keeps prices low by offering own-label alternatives such as Betty Smith's.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shelves above the freezers are piled high with tempting deals on biscuits, soft drinks and household essentials such as toilet roll. With many of those items displayed on small pallets or in boxes, it feels almost like a small-scale Lidl.</p> <p>As shoppers' budgets remain under pressure, Verdict predicts Farmfoods will see sales rise by 9% in the year ahead, well beyond the 2% expected for the grocery market as a whole. Stevens said the majority of that growth was coming from underlying sales growth, not new stores.</p> <p>He may not be big on ego, but Herd is clearly ambitious. In 2011, he teamed up with Asda, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wal-mart\" title=\"\">Walmart</a>-owned British supermarket, as part of a plan to buy out Iceland, Farmfoods' bigger rival. That plan could have resulted in Farmfoods adding as many as 200 new stores unwanted by Asda.</p> <p>With some good sales momentum behind him this year, Herd may be looking for other ways to scale up the business as he battles for appropriate sites with the likes of Aldi, Lidl and Iceland. The company lists hundreds of locations Farmfoods as targets on its website.</p> <p>So far progress has been slow and steady. Although Farmfoods has been established longer than Iceland, today it is less than a quarter the size of its bigger rival.</p> <p>The family has also shown little sign of enthusiasm for bringing in outside investment to step up the pace and buy out smaller rivals such as Frozen Value, which trades as Fultons Foods.</p> <p>Herd owns the majority of the business after buying out his brother Gordon's 21.2% stake in 2004, for \u00a310.3m. Meanwhile deputy chairman and property expert William McCreadie, the only non-family shareholder, retired last year, selling his stake to the family and lifting Herd's personal shareholding slightly to 83%.</p> <p>That gives Herd the flexibility to run the business for growth or profits as he sees fit, but may limit his firepower if the market gets tougher.</p> <p>Analysts say frozen foods specialists are likely to see growth slow if shoppers begin to feel better off this year, and devote less energy to shopping around for the best deals.</p> <p>A retail analyst at Planet Retail, David Gray, said: \"Frozen food stores saw rapid growth during the recession, there was a bit of a boom. But now the supermarkets have cottoned on and tightened up their act.\" Gray is not expecting Farmfoods to show much sales growth at all in the next few years after a tough 2012.</p> <p>That year, the most recent for which published figures are available, Farmfoods may have seen profits rise as it trimmed costs, but sales slipped back 1.5% from 2011.</p> <p>Industry insiders suggest that more recently Farmfoods has gained momentum by undercutting bigger rival Iceland on price on certain key items in an attempt to steal away shoppers. But such a move, if true, is likely to be unsustainable, said Gray.</p> <p>Meanwhile, greater scale might also bring tougher scrutiny of the quality of Farmfoods' products.</p> <p>Right now, all the attention is on Farmfoods' strength in a weak market. But this stripling will have to pull off some moves niftier than one of Goodman's dancing trainees to avoid being stomped on by bigger rivals who need all the sales they can find.</p>",

The latest research from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel suggests Farmfoods sales were nearly 44% higher in the 12 weeks to 2 February compared with the same period last year. A retail analyst at Kantar, Fraser McKevitt, said the figures should be taken with a pinch of salt because the small scale of Farmfoods makes it more difficult to track its sales patterns. But he said: \"I think growth is in strong double digits, similar to Aldi and Lidl [which stand at 32% and 17% respectively].\" In the same 12 weeks, Morrisons and Tesco saw sales fall, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Asda's sales rose just 0.5% \u2013 below the 2.4% growth achieved by the market as a whole. It is not just in groceries where shoppers' pursuit of a bargain has favoured price-cutters recently. Poundland is expected to confirm plans to float on the London stock market this week. The low-price retailer chaired by Tesco's former finance director Andy Higginson is expected to seek a total valuation of about \u00a3750m. B&amp;M, a discount retailer set up in Blackpool with just \u00a3750 in 1978, is also preparing for a stock market flotation that could value it at \u00a32bn. Beginning as a humble meat processor in 1955, Farmfoods opened its first experimental shop in Aberdeen in the early 1970s. It did not step outside its Scottish birthplace until the 1990s, but has gradually crept as far south as Plymouth in Devon. Today it has more than 320 stores and recent adverts have been fronted by Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman. Pre-tax profits for 2012 were up 10% to \u00a327m and the company handed out a \u00a310.2m dividend to its shareholders \u2013 nearly all members of the founding Herd family. That payout was up from \u00a36.8m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The major shareholder is also the boss and son of the founder. Eric Herd may be enjoying the fruits of his business, having collected about \u00a38m of the last reported dividend, but he remains media shy. The bespectacled, golf-loving Scotsman sticks to touring his stores and getting involved in the detail of the business, politely turning away interview requests. The director-general of the British Frozen Food Federation, Brian Young, describes Herd as a \"canny Scotsman\". He said: \"He really understands frozen food. He could give you a story about each of his products.\" It is his eye-catching deals, such as four litres of milk for \u00a31.60 and 30 frozen pork steaks for \u00a310, that are drawing in shoppers rather than rapidly opening stores. An analyst at Verdict Research, Andy Stevens, said: \"It's about more people shopping there. They may not get the greatest product quality, but [Farmfoods] is appealing to the sort of customer who is really value-driven.\" All the frozen food retailers have been enjoying strong growth throughout the UK's economic downturn. Apart from the inherently lower cost of frozen food, which is cheaper to transport and store than fresh, Farmfoods keeps prices low by offering own-label alternatives such as Betty Smith's. Meanwhile, shelves above the freezers are piled high with tempting deals on biscuits, soft drinks and household essentials such as toilet roll. With many of those items displayed on small pallets or in boxes, it feels almost like a small-scale Lidl. As shoppers' budgets remain under pressure, Verdict predicts Farmfoods will see sales rise by 9% in the year ahead, well beyond the 2% expected for the grocery market as a whole. Stevens said the majority of that growth was coming from underlying sales growth, not new stores. He may not be big on ego, but Herd is clearly ambitious. In 2011, he teamed up with Asda, the Walmart-owned British supermarket, as part of a plan to buy out Iceland, Farmfoods' bigger rival. That plan could have resulted in Farmfoods adding as many as 200 new stores unwanted by Asda. With some good sales momentum behind him this year, Herd may be looking for other ways to scale up the business as he battles for appropriate sites with the likes of Aldi, Lidl and Iceland. The company lists hundreds of locations Farmfoods as targets on its website. So far progress has been slow and steady. Although Farmfoods has been established longer than Iceland, today it is less than a quarter the size of its bigger rival. The family has also shown little sign of enthusiasm for bringing in outside investment to step up the pace and buy out smaller rivals such as Frozen Value, which trades as Fultons Foods. Herd owns the majority of the business after buying out his brother Gordon's 21.2% stake in 2004, for \u00a310.3m. Meanwhile deputy chairman and property expert William McCreadie, the only non-family shareholder, retired last year, selling his stake to the family and lifting Herd's personal shareholding slightly to 83%. That gives Herd the flexibility to run the business for growth or profits as he sees fit, but may limit his firepower if the market gets tougher. Analysts say frozen foods specialists are likely to see growth slow if shoppers begin to feel better off this year, and devote less energy to shopping around for the best deals. A retail analyst at Planet Retail, David Gray, said: \"Frozen food stores saw rapid growth during the recession, there was a bit of a boom. But now the supermarkets have cottoned on and tightened up their act.\" Gray is not expecting Farmfoods to show much sales growth at all in the next few years after a tough 2012. That year, the most recent for which published figures are available, Farmfoods may have seen profits rise as it trimmed costs, but sales slipped back 1.5% from 2011. Industry insiders suggest that more recently Farmfoods has gained momentum by undercutting bigger rival Iceland on price on certain key items in an attempt to steal away shoppers. But such a move, if true, is likely to be unsustainable, said Gray. Meanwhile, greater scale might also bring tougher scrutiny of the quality of Farmfoods' products. Right now, all the attention is on Farmfoods' strength in a weak market. But this stripling will have to pull off some moves niftier than one of Goodman's dancing trainees to avoid being stomped on by bigger rivals who need all the sales they can find.",

Despite a currency that makes their goods a third cheaper than two years ago, they have failed to shift much in the way of extra kit. Making matters worse, the government's attempts to stimulate domestic demand have sparked an imports binge. Set against the lacklustre export figures, the rise in imports amounts to a drag on GDP. To run through the figures, exports grew by 0.4% on the previous quarter. For an economy the size of Japan's, that could appear impressive, but it only makes up some of the 0.7% fall in the previous quarter. Then add to the mix a 3.5% jump in imports, which followed a 2.4% increase in the third quarter. Looking underneath these figures, there is even more cause for concern. Exporters are hoarding profits rather than increasing production. To shareholders that might seem like a good move after several years of low profits or even losses at the big electronics firms. But to a government that has worked hard to support business, it is a kick in the teeth. Exporters can blame the China slowdown, a soft patch in US growth and the continuing difficulties in the eurozone. And though there is little change in Europe and the US, the scale of the difficulties in China, a big market for Japanese goods, is underplayed in the western media, according to many analysts. The silver lining is a rise in investment spending. Yet for all their bluster, they should be exploiting the low value of the yen to greater effect. Meanwhile a rise in consumer confidence following a stimulus package that includes a 5.5 trillion yen boost this year has encouraged spending on Apple iPhones more than Sony PlayStations. This situation may reverse should capital investment pay dividends. However, there is a longer term problem relating to energy imports. As the country recovers and grows, it must suck in liquefied natural gas, oil and coal by the boat load. With only one of its 52 nuclear power stations in operation, and no date set for them to restart, this situation looks like it will continue for some time.",

Also, despite the high unemployment rate, the period prior to July 2003 had seen employment grow by more than the overall labour force in 16 out of the previous 21 months. However, January 2014 marked the 14th consecutive month where employment grew less than did size of the labour force in trend terms. For more than a year not enough jobs have been created to cover the new entrants into the labour force.</p> <p>Mostly this lack of new jobs can be put down to the weak growth in the economy. This is also another difference between now and 2003. Midway through 2003 Australia\u2019s economy had been growing above trend of 3% for four of the previous five years; whereas now Australia has been growing below trend for four of the previous five.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Various economic indicators: annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/fr7tg/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/fr7tg/3/\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>And while at June 2003, the economy had grown by only 3.1% in real terms (adjusted for inflation) \u2013 Australia was about to embark on the mining boom, shown by the phenomenal nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth during that period. From 1999-2000 to 2008-09 nominal GDP grew by more than 6% each year. This growth flowed through into the government\u2019s coffers. By contrast the nominal GDP growth in 2012-13 was just 2.5%.</p> <p>Similarly our current inflation and wages growth is below where it was in 2003. Back then the growth in employment \u2013 not the level of unemployment \u2013 was fuelling a growth in wages, whereas in June last year wages grew by a mere 2.9%, and have fallen even further since then.</p> <p>The changed economic picture is also evident in the level of interest rates. In 2003 the rate was at 4.75% and on the way up as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tried to stifle inflationary pressures coming from the mining boom by encouraging people to save, not spend. Now we find ourselves with rates at 2.5% and the RBA having spent two years trying to induce some life into the economy by encouraging spending and investment.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest difference between 2003 and 2013 is the growth in the terms of trade. The terms of trade measures the price of our exports and imports. When it rises it means the price we get for our exports is rising faster than the price we pay for our imports. In 2003 the terms of trade grew by only 1.5%, but the next five years would see it grow by more than 5% each year as the price of iron ore and other minerals soared. In 2012-13 however the terms of trade fell by 9.8%. That fall led to a fall in mining investment, and thus a fall in jobs in mining. The drop in investment in that sector flows through to the rest of the economy and thus other industries also see a drop in both investment and then jobs.</p> <p>The increase in Australia\u2019s export prices from 2003, which led to the growth in the overall economy and in the labour market, was fuelled by China. China\u2019s economy in 2003 grew by 10% and would grow faster than that for the next four years. For Australia to now experience a similar improvement as occurred in 2003, we need China\u2019s economy to begin growing faster than its current rate of 7.6%.</p> <p>Unfortunately no one thinks that is likely.</p> <p>And that\u2019s bad news for the current unemployed who over the past few years have been finding themselves unemployed for longer periods. In 2003 the proportion of the unemployed who had been looking for work for less than three months was increasing. This is a good sign because the better the chances of getting a job, the more likely you will be unemployed for a short period.</p> <p>In the past few years however, the proportion of those unemployed for less than three months has fallen from 48% to now about 43%. In the same period the level of long-term unemployed (those unemployed for more than a year) has risen.</p> <p>While there was a greater proportion of long-term unemployed in 2003, it was falling fast:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Length of unemployment\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/EnMAt/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/EnMAt/2/\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recently released<a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6222.0Main+Features1July%202013?OpenDocument\"> annual job search experience survey</a> from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) also gives us an indicator of the changes in difficulties for the unemployed in 2003 compared with now.</p> <p>In 2003 the most common difficulty for those seeking work was being considered too young or old (mostly too old). Now that is only the seventh most stated difficulty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Main difficulties in finding work\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Vy0nQ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/Vy0nQ/2/\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overwhelmingly the most common difficulty for the unemployed now is competition for job vacancies. And the inability to get work does not seem to be due to lack of skills or experience. Both of these reasons were more common in 2003, indicating that the labour market at the time, despite the same unemployment rate, was actually easier. When the percentage of the unemployed who have the skills and experience necessary to get a particular job is increasing, it is a clear sign that it is getting tougher to get work.</p> <p>Overall, the unemployment rate in 2003 is the same as now, but looking at the bigger picture we see very much opposite pictures. One picture looks quite optimistic; one suggests a tough period ahead. For the unemployed now, unfortunately it is their picture that is the bleaker one.</p>",

The increase in Australia\u2019s export prices from 2003, which led to the growth in the overall economy and in the labour market, was fuelled by China. China\u2019s economy in 2003 grew by 10% and would grow faster than that for the next four years. For Australia to now experience a similar improvement as occurred in 2003, we need China\u2019s economy to begin growing faster than its current rate of 7.6%. Unfortunately no one thinks that is likely. And that\u2019s bad news for the current unemployed who over the past few years have been finding themselves unemployed for longer periods. In 2003 the proportion of the unemployed who had been looking for work for less than three months was increasing. This is a good sign because the better the chances of getting a job, the more likely you will be unemployed for a short period. In the past few years however, the proportion of those unemployed for less than three months has fallen from 48% to now about 43%. In the same period the level of long-term unemployed (those unemployed for more than a year) has risen. While there was a greater proportion of long-term unemployed in 2003, it was falling fast: The recently released annual job search experience survey from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) also gives us an indicator of the changes in difficulties for the unemployed in 2003 compared with now. In 2003 the most common difficulty for those seeking work was being considered too young or old (mostly too old). Now that is only the seventh most stated difficulty. Overwhelmingly the most common difficulty for the unemployed now is competition for job vacancies. And the inability to get work does not seem to be due to lack of skills or experience. Both of these reasons were more common in 2003, indicating that the labour market at the time, despite the same unemployment rate, was actually easier. When the percentage of the unemployed who have the skills and experience necessary to get a particular job is increasing, it is a clear sign that it is getting tougher to get work. Overall, the unemployment rate in 2003 is the same as now, but looking at the bigger picture we see very much opposite pictures. One picture looks quite optimistic; one suggests a tough period ahead. For the unemployed now, unfortunately it is their picture that is the bleaker one.",
