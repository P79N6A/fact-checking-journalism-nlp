      "bodyText": "Tobacconists, estate agents and jewellers are taking over high streets across Britain as the number of shops in the country falls at its fastest rate for four years. There were 15 shop closures a day across the UK in the first half of 2016 and the number of new openings has fallen to the lowest level for five years, according to a report that highlights the pressure on the retail sector. Fashion shops are struggling, with 206 closing in the first half of the year and only 119 opening, leading to a net decline of 87. In contrast, tobacconists increased by a net of 28, with 60 openings and 32 closures, while estate agents added 26 sites and jewellers 24. The period covered by the report, which was produced by accountancy firm PwC and the Local Data Company, includes the collapse of BHS into administration. However, the last 22 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops did not close until the end of August. Matthew Hopkinson, the director of the Local Data Company, said: \u201cThe spaces left by the traditional occupants of our high streets are being increasingly filled by health care operators, food and beverage operators and the ongoing rise of the discounters.\u201d Last week, in a further blow to the high street, Gap announced it was pulling its Banana Republic brand out of the UK, which will result in the closure of eight shops. Kantar Worldpanel, the consumer research firm, also warned that fashion sales in Britain were falling at the steepest rate since the financial crisis, with shoppers spending \u00a3700m less on clothing, shoes and accessories in the year to 25 September compared with 2015. High streets across the UK are under pressure from a shift in spending from physical shops to online, a squeeze on household income, and increases in business rates and the national living wage, which has increased costs. Richard Hyman, a retail analyst, said there were too many shops in Britain. About 64% of retailers in Britain were holding sales last week as they tried to shift unsold stock, according to research conducted by Hyman. \u201cThis is the toughest retail market we have ever seen by some distance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have seen nothing yet; next year will be worse. I have been going on about this for ages, but there is oversupply. Their are too many shops and online shops. \u2018Build it and they will come\u2019 might be true in Field of Dreams, but in business you can\u2019t carry on doing that. We have got the most promotional market that anyone has ever seen.\u201d The PwC and Local Data Company report found that 2,656 outlets closed on Britain\u2019s high streets in the first half of the year. This was a rate of 15 stores a day, up from 14 a day in the same period in 2015. New openings fell from 2,197 to 2,153, the lowest since 2011. This meant that a net 503 shops disappeared from high streets during the period, the biggest decline since the first half of 2012. Greater London saw the biggest net drop in the country as 164 shops were lost. The report claimed that retailers may be preparing for an increase in business rates from next year. No area of the UK enjoyed an increase in the number of shops, although the north-east of England lost just five.",

      "bodyText": "Australia could face a growing number of expensive legal claims from foreign corporations if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into force, a new report has warned. Dr Kyla Tienhaara, from the Australian National University, said Australia ought to learn from Canada\u2019s experience after it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which came into force in 1994 and led to dozens of legal cases against Canada by US corporations. She said the frequency of trade-based legal cases against Canada had increased significantly since 2006, in line with the global trend of such disputes, and warned a similar thing might happen to Australia under the TPP, because it has an investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) provision similar to Nafta\u2019s. Tienhaara\u2019s research has informed a report, The Canary in the Coalmine, commissioned by the activist group GetUp. It warns Australia risks facing multimillion-dollar legal cases if the Senate passes the TPP, and shows ISDS disputes have been rising worldwide, hitting a record 72 cases in 2015. It says governments lose or settle ISDS cases much more often than they win them. Cases were settled, or the corporation won, in 52% of global ISDS cases, while the state won in 36% of cases, it says. The ISDS provision in the TPP excludes tobacco companies from potential legal action, but investors from a wide variety of other industries could still use it, the report warns. It says Australia\u2019s Senate ought to learn from Canada\u2019s experience before passing the trade agreement. Canada has been hit with 39 separate legal cases under Nafta \u2013 all from American corporations and investors \u2013 with 69% of those cases having been initiated since 2006, the report says. \u201cThe similarities between Canada and Australia in terms of the regulatory environment suggest that Australia is likely to face the same kind of disputes [under the TPP] as Canada has [under Nafta] \u2013 that is, disputes over regulatory issues rather than direct expropriations or other interferences in the operation of an investment,\u201d the report warns. Natalie O\u2019Brien, GetUp\u2019s economic fairness campaigns director, said the report demonstrated the \u201cenormous risks\u201d Australia faced under the TPP. \u201cMultinationals based in the USA and Canada are the most litigious in the world by an enormous margin \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership would leave Australia exposed to both,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cPerhaps the most terrifying finding is the evidence of \u2018regulatory chill\u2019, where governments back away from critical health or environmental regulations because of the threat of ISDS. \u201cThe Quebec government revoked fracking rights in St Lawrence after an assessment that it would impact local marine life. Now they are being sued under ISDS by an American corporation seeking US$118.9m in compensation.\u201d But Luke Nottage, professor of comparative and transnational business law at Sydney University, has said modern ISDS disputes are generally handled well. He said better public consultation on treaty drafts, with help from experts, might assuage concerns about the investment chapters in major trade agreements. The TPP is the biggest global trade deal in 20 years, involving 12 countries in the Pacific region that collectively represent more than 40% of world gross domestic product. It includes Australia, the US, New Zealand and Japan, and will ensure the US\u2019s influence in the Asia-Pacific region in the face of growing Chinese influence \u2013 if ratified.",

      "bodyText": "The latest release of the labour force figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics brings to the fore that while the unemployment rate is falling, the employment sector is fragile, with full-time employment falling and hours worked barely growing at all. Last Thursday\u2019s labour force figures showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.6% \u2013 the best result since May 2013. But the big news item was that full-time employment fell by 53,000 in seasonally adjusted terms, the biggest one month fall for more than five years. Of course, we should always be a little wary of seasonally adjusted changes \u2013 the figures do always seems to have their finger stuck in the electrical socket: But the annual growth picture is a lot clearer, and it shows that full-time employment is now lower than it was 12 months ago: It reinforces what I have been saying for a while now \u2013 the unemployment rate is hiding much of what is happening in the economy. The main reason the unemployment rate has fallen this year is that the level of people within the labour force has also fallen. In November last year, the participation rate (the percentage of people in the labour force) was 65.1%, now it is 64.7%. The difference is the equivalent of 90,000 people, and if we still had November\u2019s participation rate, the unemployment rate would be 6.3% instead of 5.6%. This month adults employed fell to 61.0%. It was last at that level in August last year but then the unemployment rate was 6.1%. The figures highlight that the employment story of the past year has been one of part-time work growing, while full-time work is shrinking: The strong growth of part-time employment means that the growth of hours worked is dropping sharply and the growth of total employment is now beginning to follow: But there is more going on in the picture than just the full-time/part-time mix \u2013 it is a story about gender and age. As I have noted in the past, since the GFC, youth employment has fallen sharply, and yet in 2015 there was a nice improvement for youth employed. But that nice improvement is all gone now. In the past 12 months, full-time employment for those aged 15 to 24 fell by 4.8%, whereas for those in the prime working age of 25 to 64, it grew 0.5%: Now this might suggest that the issue of full-time employment is just one about youth. And certainly the lack of youth in full-time work is dragging down the overall figures, but the picture for those prime-aged workers is not real flash either. Over the past 30 years, annual full-time employment growth for prime-aged workers has averaged 1.7%. But in the past five years, growth has only been above that level for five months. The reality is we are in a historically low full-time employment period: And the big cause has been the lack of full-time employment for men \u2013 both youth and prime-aged. In the past 12 months, male employment for those aged 25 to 64 has fallen by 7,300 whereas for the same aged women it has increased by 41,600. For male youth, full-time employment fell 30,800, while for female youth, after a good period in 2015 and the start of this year, the situation has turned sharply and full-time work has also fallen \u2013 down 11,200: There is now a record low number of men aged 25 to 64 working full time \u2013 just 72.2% down from a peak of 75.8% in 2008: By contrast more prime-aged women are now working full time than ever before. But at just 39.9% it remains well below the level of men. It\u2019s why when full-time employment is weak we are mostly talking about weak employment growth for men. It has reached a point where despite men making up nearly two-thirds of all full-time workers, in the past five years there have actually been more full-time jobs created for women than men \u2013 a situation not seen since the 1990s recession: There is usually a quite strong link between the unemployment rate and full-time employment. In the past 12 months the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.4% points. Usually such a fall would be associated with full-time employment growing by nearly 2%; instead it shrunk. Partly this fall can be explained by the lack of full-time work for youth, but it is clear that the issue is deeper than that. In the past five years the number of men in the labour force has increased by 5.5%, and yet full-time employment for men has gone up by just 1.5%. While the unemployment rate continues to fall due to a falling participation rate, the government will mostly seek to focus on the big number. But there has never been a time when falling full-time employment has been associated with a strong economy. And right now, when looking for a good indicator of the state of the economy, you are better off looking at full-time employment than at the unemployment rate.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ousting of Cyrus Mistry as boss of Tata is a shock and could have serious implications for the UK. Tata matters to the UK. It owns Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain, Tata Steel (11,000 jobs) and other brands including Tetley Tea. Theresa May is keen to draw up an industrial strategy for the country. One of the key people the prime minister needs to talk to for that is the boss of Tata. In fact, one of the first people Greg Clark met after becoming business secretary was Mistry in Mumbai. The end of Mistry\u2019s four-year tenure was revealed in a remarkably terse statement by the Indian conglomerate. \u201cThe decision was taken at a board meeting held here today,\u201d Tata said. Sources say there was discontent on the board and among shareholders about the financial performance of the group. The change at the top of Tata has created a storm in India, where it is arguably the country\u2019s most famous corporate group. Mistry\u2019s exit was the lead story on Indian news sites on Monday. To put it into context, Ratan Tata, who is replacing Mistry on an interim basis, wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi to inform him of the news. Tata has become renowned for its stability, privacy, and long-term perspective. Mistry only gave his first interview as Tata boss a few weeks ago, and that was to the group website. Tata\u2019s overseas expansion, particularly into Britain, created much pride in India. So this brutal switch at the top is extraordinary. Ratan Tata was chairman for 21 years before stepping aside for Mistry in 2012 after turning 75. Now he is back as chairman, at least for the next four months as a committee looks for a permanent replacement. Ironically, one the biggest criticisms from analysts and investors about Tata under Mistry has been the slow speed at which he has tackled the problems facing the conglomerate. Although Ratan Tata expanded the company around the world, some of the businesses he bought now look overpriced and in need of restructuring \u2013 perhaps none more so than Tata Steel. Tata paid \u00a36.2bn for the Corus steel business in 2007, which in hindsight was the top of the commodities and financial cycle. If only Tata had acted as decisively with its UK steel business as it has with axing Mistry. The Indian company announced it was reviewing the future of its UK business in March, but this remains unresolved. The departure of Mistry as chairman could be good news for Tata Steel\u2019s 11,000 UK workers because Ratan Tata is a renowned Anglophile who bought the business in the first place. But Mistry and Tata Steel had been making progress on a potential merger of its European steel operations with ThyssenKrupp and were close to a deal with the UK government about financial support and a restructuring of its pension scheme. There is now a new uncertainty hanging over this deal. After months of worrying about their future, workers at the Port Talbot steelworks owned by Tata Steel could do without this. Heathrow The main argument about why Britain needs to expand its airport capacity in south-east England is to help economic growth and encourage trade links with emerging markets such as China. But on the eve of the government announcing whether to expand Heathrow, Gatwick or neither, British Airways has quietly put a spanner in that argument. With remarkable timing, BA has decided to drop its flights from Heathrow to Chengdu, the Chinese city that was cited by pro-expansion campaigners as a key destination. BA launched flights to Chengdu, its fourth Chinese destination, in late 2013. It had already trimmed the frequency of the service on the route. The success or failure of one route should not determine Britain\u2019s transport strategy. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, has previously blamed the problems getting a British visa for weak demand on flights to and from China. Nonetheless, it shows that some of the presumptions behind the arguments to expand Heathrow or Gatwick \u2013 such as the boost to Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 are by no means guaranteed. BHS Away from the House of Commons and its raucous criticism of Sir Philip Green, the BHS scandal is far from over. The department store chain\u2019s administrators, the Insolvency Service, and the Serious Fraud Office are all still hard at work establishing why the company collapsed and trying to recover money owed to it. As shown by the news at the weekend that the administrators to BHS are trying to wind up Retail Acquisitions, the company Dominic Chappell used to buy the retailer, there is still much work to do on this front. If Retail Acquisitions is wound up then Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, will gain access to it books and potentially recover funds that it owes BHS. This could be vital in understanding what went on before the collapse, which left more than \u00a31bn of debts and led to 11,000 job losses.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/tata-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry-replaced-ratan-tata-jaguar-land-rover-tata-steel\">The ousting of Cyrus Mistry as boss of Tata</a> is a shock and could have serious implications for the UK.</p> <p>Tata matters to the UK. It owns Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain, Tata Steel (11,000 jobs) and other brands including Tetley Tea.</p> <p>Theresa May is keen to draw up an industrial strategy for the country. One of the key people the prime minister needs to talk to for that is the boss of Tata. In fact, one of the first people Greg Clark met after becoming business secretary was Mistry in Mumbai.</p> <p>The end of Mistry\u2019s four-year tenure was revealed in a remarkably terse statement by the Indian conglomerate. \u201cThe decision was taken at a board meeting held here today,\u201d Tata said. Sources say there was discontent on the board and among shareholders about the financial performance of the group.</p> <p>The change at the top of Tata has created a storm in India, where it is arguably the country\u2019s most famous corporate group. Mistry\u2019s exit was the lead story on Indian news sites on Monday. To put it into context, Ratan Tata, who is replacing Mistry on an interim basis, wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi to inform him of the news.</p> <p>Tata has become renowned for its stability, privacy, and long-term perspective. Mistry only gave his first interview as Tata boss a few weeks ago, and that was to the group website. Tata\u2019s overseas expansion, particularly into Britain, created much pride in India.</p> <p>So this brutal switch at the top is extraordinary. Ratan Tata was chairman for 21 years before stepping aside for Mistry in 2012 after turning 75. Now he is back as chairman, at least for the next four months as a committee looks for a permanent replacement.</p> <p>Ironically, one the biggest criticisms from analysts and investors about Tata under Mistry has been the slow speed at which he has tackled the problems facing the conglomerate. </p> <p>Although Ratan Tata expanded the company around the world, some of the businesses he bought now look overpriced and in need of restructuring \u2013 perhaps none more so than Tata Steel. Tata paid \u00a36.2bn for the Corus steel business in 2007, which in hindsight was the top of the commodities and financial cycle.</p> <p>If only Tata had acted as decisively with its UK steel business as it has with axing Mistry. The Indian company announced it was reviewing the future of its UK business in March, but this remains unresolved.<br></p> <p>The departure of Mistry as chairman could be good news for Tata Steel\u2019s 11,000 UK workers because Ratan Tata is a renowned Anglophile who bought the business in the first place.</p> <p>But Mistry and Tata Steel had been making progress on a potential merger of its European steel operations with ThyssenKrupp and were close to a deal with the UK government about financial support and a restructuring of its pension scheme.</p> <p>There is now a new uncertainty hanging over this deal. After months of worrying about their future, workers at the Port Talbot steelworks owned by Tata Steel could do without this.</p> <h2>Heathrow</h2> <p>The main argument about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">why Britain needs to expand its airport capacity in south-east England</a> is to help economic growth and encourage trade links with emerging markets such as China.</p> <p>But on the eve of the government announcing whether to expand Heathrow, Gatwick or neither, British Airways has quietly put a spanner in that argument.</p> <p>With remarkable timing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/ba-scraps-service-chinese-city-airport-expansion-heathrow-chengdu-decision-runway\">BA has decided to drop its flights from Heathrow to Chengdu</a>, the Chinese city that was cited by pro-expansion campaigners as a key destination. BA launched flights to Chengdu, its fourth Chinese destination, in late 2013. It had already trimmed the frequency of the service on the route.</p> <p>The success or failure of one route should not determine Britain\u2019s transport strategy. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, has previously blamed the problems getting a British visa for weak demand on flights to and from China. Nonetheless, it shows that some of the presumptions behind the arguments to expand Heathrow or Gatwick \u2013 such as the boost to Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 are by no means guaranteed.</p> <h2>BHS</h2> <p>Away from the House of Commons and its raucous criticism of Sir Philip Green, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a> scandal is far from over. </p> <p>The department store chain\u2019s administrators, the Insolvency Service, and the Serious Fraud Office are all still hard at work establishing why the company collapsed and trying to recover money owed to it.<br></p> <p>As shown by the news at the weekend that the administrators to BHS are trying to wind up Retail Acquisitions, the company Dominic Chappell used to buy the retailer, there is still much work to do on this front.</p> <p>If Retail Acquisitions is wound up then Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, will gain access to it books and potentially recover funds that it owes BHS. This could be vital in understanding what went on before the collapse, which left more than \u00a31bn of debts and led to 11,000 job losses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chengdu was where British business would fly to and build trade links if only Heathrow was big enough, according to prominent backers of airport expansion. But less than three years after British Airways found a Heathrow slot to fly to the Chinese megacity, and on the eve of a decision to build a new runway, the airline has dropped the route because it is not commercially viable. BA launched direct flights to Chengdu, its fourth Chinese destination, in late 2013, and ran return flights five times a week. Even after having trimmed down the frequency and switched to a smaller, Boeing 787 plane, BA has confirmed that the service will end this January. Before it announced the new service, the lack of links to Chengdu had been highlighted by Heathrow and politicians as a major example of how capacity constraints at the airport were stopping Britain connecting to the world, especially to \u201cemerging markets\u201d. However, it now appears few people want to fly there. Launching Heathrow\u2019s first submission to the Airports Commission in November 2012, the airport\u2019s chief executive, Colin Matthews, said a lack of capacity was limiting Britain\u2019s ability to connect to growing cities in emerging markets, such as Chengdu in China. Two months earlier, the lack of direct flights to Chengdu was highlighted in an intervention from senior Conservatives that prompted the then prime minister, David Cameron, to set up Sir Howard Davies\u2019s commission and pave the way for expansion. In the opening line of an article demanding whether Cameron was \u201cman or mouse\u201d, MP Tim Yeo wrote: \u201cWhat better way to kickstart Britain\u2019s sluggish economy than by boosting trade with China? Perhaps with Chongqing, with 28 million consumers, many enjoying rising incomes. Or Chengdu, with 14 million.\u201d A year before that, the then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, lamented the Chengdu-goer\u2019s plight as he again argued for more runway capacity. \u201cWe are making it harder for British business people to get to the future megacities from London than from our competitor airports. If you want to fly to Chengdu \u2026 you can get there direct from one of London\u2019s Continental rivals \u2013 but you can\u2019t get there from Heathrow,\u201d he said in a comment piece. In a statement, BA said on Monday: \u201cWe regret that we have decided to suspend the Heathrow to Chengdu route. We have a proud tradition of flying to China but despite operating this route for three years it is not commercially viable.\u201d Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, has previously blamed the British visa regime for the disappointing traffic on the route. Aviation analyst John Strickland said: \u201cI think what it shows is that China is not a mature aviation market outside the very established markets \u2026 But if you are going to allow a route to develop, you definitely need a hub airport like Heathrow where you can count on transfer passengers to support the point-to-point until the route reaches maturity.\u201d A spokeswoman for the airport said a \u201cdegree of ebb and flow on demand on specific routes\u201d was normal, adding: \u201cThe record shows Heathrow overall has gained and maintained new long-haul routes that are so critical for the British economy.\u201d Destinations in emerging markets such as Vietnam and Indonesia were among the six long-haul routes added since 2010, she said. A spokesperson for Gatwick, which still hopes to beat Heathrow in building London\u2019s next runway, said: \u201cLack of current connectivity to some markets \u2013 in China for instance \u2013 is less to do with capacity and more to do with lack of demand. When slots have become available, airlines at Heathrow have been consistently adding capacity on these profitable routes \u2013 such as North America and Europe \u2013 rather than use them for emerging markets.\u201d BA\u2019s 787 plane and Heathrow slot will be used to fly to New Orleans instead.",

      "bodyText": "Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from any agreement by Opec to cut production. Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in November. But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to whether any agreement could be reached after all. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, does not seem to have given up yet on an EU-Canada trade deal: Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Jennifer Rankin writes: The European Union\u2019s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week appear to have gone up in smoke, after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments. The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u2019s federal and regional leaders. The Belgian stalemate means Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next steps remained unclear. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau later on Monday. Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained stuck. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel. The full report is here: A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner, and better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE\u2019s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their gains, but the fall for London\u2019s chief index is the standout feature of the day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today\u2019s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1206. UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Speaking in parliament she said: \u201cI share everyone\u2019s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.\u201d But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK\u2019s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own. More on the prime minister in parliament in the politics live blog: Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable exception. Helped by M&amp;A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.8% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.65%. But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day\u2019s better than expected PMI readings. The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after the bell to approach 18250. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors continued to react to this morning\u2019s troublesome CBI industrial order expectations slide. More from Reuters on Belgium\u2019s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal: \u201cWe cannot give a yes,\u201d Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU authorities. Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel\u2019s liberal-led federal coalition: \u201cWe have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and it\u2019s a No from the others,\u201d said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the meeting at Michel\u2019s residence lasting less than an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame,\u201d the center-right leader said. \u201cWe\u2019re the laughing stock of the whole world. It\u2019s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.\u201d Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are ready to support... Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada\u2019s by C$12 billion (US $9 billion). Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette\u2019s stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium. Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. He said: Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months. There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook. More signs of strength in the US economy. The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015. The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and US Treasury bond prices lower. Merger Monday has given US stock markets an early lift, ahead of a spate of major results later in the week, including from Apple and Boeing. AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner is not the only deal on the table. Broker TD Ameritrade plans to pay $4bn for Scottrade Financial Services, while aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins is offering $6.4bn for B/E Aerospace. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 114 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.45% higher and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.64%. Bullard also said: The St. Louis Fed\u2019s conclusion is that a single 25-basis-point increase in the policy rate\u2013from 38 to 63 basis points\u2013will get us very close to the Taylor rule value over the forecast horizon. [The Taylor rule provides a recommended setting for the FOMC\u2019s policy rate based on current values of observable macroeconomic variables, according to Bullard] Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data for October, a Federal Reserve member has repeated his belief that one further interest rate rise is all that is necessary for the moment. St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told a conference in Arkansas: The current policy rate setting is just 38 basis points, extraordinarily low by postwar historical standards. The Federal Open Markets Committee is considering raising the policy rate to a somewhat higher level, [but] the St. Louis Fed\u2019s rate path projection is much flatter than the rest of the Committee. The bottom line: Low interest rates are likely to continue to be the norm over the next two to three years. Hopes that Belgium would back a European Union trade deal with Canada appear to have been dashed, putting the agreement in jeopardy. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said he had told EC president Donald Tusk today that the country could not sign the deal because he had failed to get agreement from regional authorities, notably Wallonia. The EU had given Belgium\u2019s federal government until late on Monday to secure backing for a deal, or a summit to sign the Ceta agreement planned for Thursday would be cancelled. But according to Reuters, Michel said to reporters after meeting regional leaders: I have officially told Tusk that we have no agreement. He said he was still open to further talks with Wallonia and said it was too early to say whether Ceta, which has been in negotiations for several years, was dead. But Tusk is now expected to contact Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and call off Thursday\u2019s planned summit. The omens had not looked good ahead of the meeting between Michel and the leaders of five regional authorities , with Wallonia\u2019s premier Paul Magnette criticising the deadline placed on the deal. He said (quote from Reuters): Every time you try to put an ultimatum it makes a calm debate and a democratic debate impossible.. We don\u2019t need an ultimatum. We will not decide anything under an ultimatum or under pressure. Magnette says the deal is bad for Europe\u2019s farmers and gives too much power to global corporate interests. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard has just been released, and it shows that Britain\u2019s economy is starting to lose momentum as the impact of June\u2019s referendum is felt. The dashboard is a comprehensive assessment of conditions in the UK economy, and it highlights that living standards are being squeezed as the slump in sterling hits people in the pocket. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The dashboard for October shows that four of the eight categories have performed worse than expected, two were as expected, and two were better. Inflation jumped more sharply than expected to 1%, the highest level in almost two years, Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened, as growth in imports rose faster than exports, and retail sales were flat as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm September. Here\u2019s the story: Economist Danny Blanchflower fears that Britain is facing an \u201concoming Brexit tsunami\u201d, while PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance is more positive. Here are their takes: And you can see the full dashboard here: Here\u2019s a recent-ish photo of Cyrus Mistry: Cyrus Mistry\u2019s shock exit from Tata today is causing a real stir. My colleague Graham Ruddick says it has implications for steelworkers in South Wales, whose future has been in doubt since Tata announced plans to sell, or shut, it. The Economist\u2019s Stanley Pignal reckons Mistry paid the price for Tata\u2019s recent struggles. Now this is interesting... Tata, the Indian manufacturing giant, has just announced the departure of its chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Ratan Tata, who ran the company for two decades, is stepping in while a permanent successor is found. In a brief statement, Tata says: Tata Sons today announced that its Board has replaced Mr. Cyrus P. Mistry as Chairman of Tata Sons. The decision was taken at a Board meeting held here today. The Board has named Mr. Ratan N. Tata as Interim Chairman of Tata Sons. The Board has constituted a Selection Committee to choose a new Chairman. The Committee comprises Mr. Ratan N. Tata, Mr. Venu Srinivasan, Mr. Amit Chandra, Mr. Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, as per the criteria in the Articles of Association of Tata Sons. The committee has been mandated to complete the selection process in four months. It\u2019s not immediately clear why Mistry is off, but Tata\u2019s somewhat-sprawling operations have been struggling to keep pace with rivals. The group is involved in steel, automobiles, consultancy, power, and mobile telecoms.... Bang on cue, AT&amp;T and Time Warner are defending their merger (which they claim is a \u201cperfect match\u201d) The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, and open higher today. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is tipped to jump by 0.5% when trading begins (at 2.30pm BST). AT&amp;T\u2019s plan to acquire Time Warner for $85bn has given Wall Street a dose of merger fever, even though the deal has been criticised by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Democratic vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine: Some reaction to Microsoft\u2019s Brexit price hike: Brexit may mean Brexit, but it also means businesses paying a lot more for using Microsoft\u2019s products. The tech giant is hiking the cost of its enterprise software, by up to 22%, in response to the slump in the pound since June\u2019s referendum. It starts in January. As my colleague Alex Hern points out, other technology products and services have also spiked in cost recently: Newsflash: UK factories have suffered a fall in industrial orders this month. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of manufacturers shows that the balance of orders fell to -17 this month, down from -6 in September. That suggests that factories are finding things a bit tougher this month. But... they\u2019re also more upbeat about future prospects. The CBI\u2019s business optimism index has risen to -8, from a positively gloomy -47 in September. And the balance of firms reporting higher exports rose to +8 over the last three months. Perhaps the most interesting line is that the weak pound isn\u2019t being cheered too loudly. Almost half the exporters surveyed said the fall in sterling was bad for their business (even though it should make their products more attractive in foreign markets). Today\u2019s report shows that the prices paid by UK factories for their materials jumped at the fastest rate in three years, and are expected to continue growing at above their long-term average over the quarter ahead. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, says: \u201cManufacturers\u2019 are optimistic about export prospects and export orders are growing, following the fall in Sterling. \u201cHowever, the weaker Pound is also feeding through to costs, which are rising briskly and may well spill over into higher consumer prices in the months ahead. Back in the City, shares in UK defence firm Cobham have slumped by 17% this morning after it hit investors with its second profit warning in six months. Cobham is languishing at the bottom of the FSTE 250 leaderboard, after it warned that revenues and profits continue to miss expectations. More here: Eurozone investors are also cheered by political developments in Spain, where right-wing leader Mariano Rajoy has the green light to form another administration. After 10 months of deadlock, Spain\u2019s socialist party has decided not to oppose a confidence vote, meaning Rajoy should be clear to form a minority government. The move is unpopular with some left-wing politicians, who feel they shouldn\u2019t prop up Rajoy\u2019s PP party (which is facing a flurry of corruption charges). But the prospect of a stable government in Madrid, after two inconclusive elections, is encouraging traders to buy Spanish debt. This is driving down Spain\u2019s bond yields, meaning it can borrow at cheaper rates: The euro is struggling back from its lowest level in seven months. The single currency is hovering around $1.089, having earlier fallen as low as $1.086 - its weakest point since the EU referendum. The pound is little changed this morning, at $1.224 against the dollar. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver explains: Expectations that the Fed will move on interest rates by the end of the year, likely in December, have contributed to dollar strength. The euro remains relatively under pressure in light of ongoing stimulus from the European Central Bank. The pound continues to be driven by ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of the triggering of Article 50 by next March, particularly concerns that the UK will pursue a \u201chard\u201d Brexit. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that eurozone firms are hiking prices this month, for the first time in over a year. Markit says: With demand firming, companies were increasingly able to charge higher rates to customers. Average prices charged for goods and services rose for the first time since August 2015. Higher prices were often a reflection of the need to pass rising costs on to customers. Average input costs increased at the steepest rate for 15 months, linked mainly to higher commodity prices, notably oil-related, as well as rising wage costs. October\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs suggest the eurozone is growing at a quarterly rate of around 0.4%, says Markit. That would beat the 0.3% recorded between April and June, but is still rather unspectacular. Dutch financial blogger Jeroen Blokland believes that today\u2019s PMI survey shows the European Central Bank should start reining in its stimulus programme: The ECB\u2019s QE programme is due to run out next March. Last week, president Mario Draghi hinted that it could be extended, perhaps in December. Here\u2019s economist Marcus Wright on today\u2019s PMI report: Here\u2019s Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u2019s healthcheck on the eurozone economy: According to the flash PMIs estimates, after a difficult summer, the Eurozone is accelerating again at the start of the 4th quarter. The improvement in Services in Germany is particularly encouraging as this had been an area of concerns recently. The focus is now likely to switch to inflation dynamics with input costs in Germany rising at the fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years and backlogs of work in the Eurozone accumulating at the fastest rate for over 5 years. Although we believe this would be premature, this might trigger renewed concerns about the ECB having to \u201ctaper\u201d its quantitative easing in the coming months. [Tapering = cutting the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, which is currently buying \u20ac80bn of new bonds each month] Boom! Eurozone companies are growing at their fastest rate this year, as they put the shock of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote behind them. Firms are benefitting from a surge in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff to deal with a growing backlog of work. That\u2019s the message from Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck on the eurozone economy, just released. Markit\u2019s flash composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.7 from September\u2019s 52.6. That\u2019s the highest reading since December 2015, and much stronger than expected. Here are the details: As we covered earlier, Germany\u2019s PMI hit a three month high this week, while France\u2019s factories have made a welcome (and long-awaited) return to growth. The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors both posted a rise in new output, at the highest rate since the start of this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the future looks quite bright: \u201cThe eurozone economy showed renewed signs of life at the start of the fourth quarter, enjoying its strongest expansion so far this year with the promise of more to come. With backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest rate for over five years, business activity growth and hiring look set to accelerate further as we head towards the end of the year. \u201cOctober\u2019s PMI is consistent with a quarterly GDP growth rate of 0.4%, led by a 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany. Modest growth of 0.2-0.3% is being signalled for France, but there are various indicators which suggest that France will enjoy stronger growth in coming months, including a marked build-up of uncompleted work. More to follow.... Some early reaction: This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: And here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by France after its factory sector returned to growth. The French CAC has gained 0.65%, while in London the FTSE 100 is up 44 points, or 0.6%, at 7064. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Finally crawling out of contraction territory the French manufacturing PMI hit a 10 month high of 51.3 this morning; the services sector wasn\u2019t so strong, however, slipping from 53.3 (revised down from 54.1) to 52.1 month-on-month. Germany, meanwhile, beat estimates on both counts; its manufacturing PMI came in at a 32 month peak of 55.1, with the services reading at a 3 month high of 54.1. This allowed the DAX and CAC to post some decent gains this Monday, rising 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. German companies have also beaten expectations, reporting their strongest growth in three months. Markit\u2019s Flash Germany Composite Output Index has jumped to 55.1 in October, up from September\u2019s 16-month low of 52.8. Factories reported their biggest leap in activity in almost three years, while service sector firms also picked up. That suggests Germany\u2019s private sector has put its recent slowdown behind it. Firms also reported that new orders grew at their fastest rate this year Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe German economy has entered the fast lane again at the start of the fourth quarter, with output growth accelerating from September\u2019s recent low. The improvement in the PMI in October lifts hopes that the weaker expansions we have seen in the past two months were just a temporary soft patch, rather than the beginning of a serious slowdown. Encouragingly, French business expectations have strengthened this month, with more bosses planning to spend more on advertising and new projects: Markit says: Some panellists were buoyed by the latest increases in demand, while planned rises in investment and marketing were expected to boost overall activity. Less encouragingly, French firms are still cutting staff: On the employment front, staffing levels were marginally lower for the fifth time in 2016 so far. Both manufacturing and services sectors recorded slight drops in employment, although the fall in manufacturing was the lowest recorded in eight months of job shedding. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s snap summary of the French PMIs: France\u2019s manufacturing sector has given the markets an early-morning lift, by reporting that they\u2019ve posted their strongest growth this year. Factory output has hit its fastest rate since March 2014 this month, raising hopes that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is picking up. This pushed the \u2018flash\u2019 French manufacturing PMI, produced by Markit, up to 51.5 in October, from 49.7 in September. That\u2019s a 10-month high, ending a long run of contraction. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that French factories are enjoyinga decent enough autumn. However.... service sector growth slowed to a three-month low; meaning the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 actually dipped a little, to 52.2 from 52.7. Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u201cAlthough growth slipped slightly in October, the latest data revealed a number of positives for the French economy, especially on the manufacturing side with rising exports supporting a marked uplift in output. With signs of intensifying capacity pressures and service providers indicating expectations for near-term growth, the outlook for the rest of 2016 looks reasonably positive.\u201d Next up, German PMI..... There\u2019s relief in the eurozone today, after Portugal successfully held onto its investment-grade credit rating on Friday night. There had been fears that rating agency DBRS would slash Portugal\u2019s credit rating in to junk territory, which would have had serious consequences for. But instead, DBRS maintained Lisbon\u2019s BBB rating with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook, despite earlier expressing concerns over low growth and high debt. That has sent Portugal\u2019s bonds rallying this morning, driving down the yield on 10-year debt to a six-week low of just 3.08%. If Portugal had been downgraded by DBRS, it would no longer have been eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. That would have driven up borrowing costs, and raised fears that the eurozone crisis was heating up again. Portugal\u2019s government welcomed the move, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s decision increases our own and the markets\u2019 confidence in the policies chosen for the country.\u201d But.... Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s have already slashed Portugal into junk territory, expressing fears over its slow growth rates and high public debt. So Lisbon isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be a big week for economic data. On Thursday, we learn how the UK economy performed in the last three months, immediately after the Brexit vote. Economists expect growth to slow to 0.3% or 0.4%, from 0.7% in April. That\u2019s a significant slowdown, but not as bad as some forecasters had predicted during the referendum campaign. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it would be: ...not bad considering the doom and gloom about the UK economy, some may say. However, there are a few signs that Brexit is starting to weigh on the UK economy. Business investment is expected to be weak, and we expect another quarter of growth heavily reliant on the consumer. Going forward, we see consumer confidence flagging once Article 50 is triggered at some point early in Q1 next year. Then on Friday, we get US GDP figures for the third quarter. Growth is expected to speed up, to around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: This is an immensely important week in terms of economic data and we may see some serious firecrackers which lightens up some bonfire. We could potentially see massive swings in the forex and equity markets as investors scrutinized the third quarter GDP number for the US economy which is due at the end of the week. What traders want to know is that if the US economy is regaining traction. There\u2019s not much UK economic news today, apart from the CBI\u2019s regular healthcheck on UK industry (published at 11am BST). We also get a flash view of the European economy from 8am to 9am, when the latest surveys of manufacturing and services companies in France, Germany, and the wider eurozone are released.

But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The FTSE\u2019s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The future of Britain\u2019s steel industry has been thrown into fresh uncertainty after the man in charge of Indian conglomerate Tata Group, which controls the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, was unexpectedly ousted. Cyrus Mistry will be replaced as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group, by the man he succeeded as boss in 2012, Ratan Tata. This means that control of Tata is back with its founding family. Ratan Tata will serve as interim chairman while the conglomerate looks for a permanent replacement for Mistry. The exit of Mistry comes as Tata Steel is deep in negotiations with German company ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations. Tata Steel is also in talks with the UK government about financial support for Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people, and a restructuring of its pension scheme. Tata Steel has warned that Tata Steel UK will only be included in a deal with ThyssenKrupp if talks with the government are constructive. Mistry has been at the heart of these negotiations. Greg Clark, the business secretary, and his predecessor Sajid Javid have each flown to Mumbai seeking assurances over the future of Tata Steel. The fate of Tata Steel UK has been unclear since the Indian company announced in March that it was reviewing its European steel operations. If deals can be reached with ThyssenKrupp and the government then the Port Talbot steelworks and its other key sites will be saved, but unions have criticised the time it has taken for Tata to confirm its plans. Sources close to Tata said Mistry was leaving because of a \u201clack of performance\u201d across the group, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley Tea and a string of other diverse brands. Analysts and investors in India were shocked by the move. Tata has become renowned for its long-term outlook and stability, with Ratan Tata spending more than two decades as chairman before stepping aside for Mistry. In a brief statement, the Mumbai-based Tata said on Monday that Mistry was stepping down after a \u201cdecision was taken at a board meeting held here today\u201d. The 148-year-old company gave no public reason for the surprise departure of Mistry after four years in charge. Tata said its committee would aim to find a new chairman within four months. Mistry, 48, joined Tata\u2019s board in 2006 and was Ratan Tata\u2019s choice to succeed him when he retired in 2012. Mistry\u2019s father, Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, owns 18.5% of Tata, making him the biggest single shareholder of a company whose shares are mostly owned by family trusts. His sister Aloo is married to Ratan Tata\u2019s half-brother, Noel. Early reports from India suggested the board was unhappy about Mistry\u2019s push to shed unprofitable businesses, including Tata Steel in the UK, the disposal of which was announced in March. Ratan Tata, 78, is the great grandson of Tata\u2019s founder, Jamsetji Tata, and chairs the trusts that own two-thirds of the company. Ratan Tata oversaw a period of expansion, including the purchase of Jaguar Land Rover and Corus, which included the remnants of the old British Steel, during 21 years as chairman. Tata\u2019s growth, especially in the UK, was a source of pride in India, but it has been criticised for lack of dynamism and spreading itself too thinly. A recent article in the Economist said Mistry had failed to reorganise the company\u2019s sprawling empire comprising businesses, from watches to IT consultancy, that barely have contact with each other.",

    "webTitle": "ITV cuts 120 jobs as Brexit uncertainty slows UK TV ad market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ITV has announced plans to cut 120 jobs due to \u201cpolitical and economic uncertainty\u201d, particularly concerns over the possible impact of Brexit. UK broadcasters are facing the worst year for TV advertising since 2009, with total revenues set to decline by up to 2%. The announcement on Monday comes three months after ITV\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, said the broadcaster would look to make \u00a325m in cost savings next year following the Brexit vote on 23 June. ITV intends to make the cuts across the business, but does not plan to reduce its annual programming budget of more than \u00a31bn. The company has 3,000 staff in the UK, out of 6,000 globally, with US-based employees forming its next largest workforce. \u201cAt a time of political and economic uncertainty in our key markets, it\u2019s important that we are in the strongest possible position to continue to invest in our strategy, and to meet any challenges and opportunities ahead, as we continue to grow a successful business,\u201d an ITV spokesman said. Fears about the impact of Brexit and a rapid softening of the UK advertising market are the paramount reasons for the job cuts. ITV is dependent on the performance of the UK market, which accounted for 85% of the near-\u00a33bn the broadcaster made last year. Crozier has spent hundreds of millions of pounds attempting to reduce the company\u2019s reliance on the UK, primarily by building a large TV production operation in the US. But ITV\u2019s historical dependence on advertising meant that last year, TV ads and sponsorship accounted for more than half, about \u00a31.7bn, of revenues. \u201cWe have taken costs out across ITV in a managed and sensible way over the past six years and we must continue to keep a tight control on spending to ensure that we are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible, while maximising our ability to invest in the high-quality programming that drives ITV\u2019s success,\u201d the ITV spokesman said. The company has estimated that in the first nine months of 2016, ad revenue would be down 1% year on year. Prior to the EU referendum, the ad market had been expected to grow by more than 7%, after a 7.4% increase in 2015. Media agencies, which book advertising on behalf of clients, have said the TV advertising market has become considerably worse in the past five or so weeks amid concerns about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Last month, ITV\u2019s share price tumbled after Crozier and the finance director, Ian Griffiths, cashed in \u00a32m of shares, as some investors worried that this could be a sign its stock market price may be close to peaking. Last month it emerged that Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of the Daily Mail, has cut more than 400 jobs over the past year. Fewer than half came from DMG Media, the division that includes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and freesheet Metro, as newspaper publishers continue to face a tough advertising market. This month, the BBC said it would make redundant more than 300 programme makers as part of a move to spin off its \u00a3400m TV production operation, which makes shows including EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing.",

Almost half, or 47%, cited sterling\u2019s depreciation as having a negative impact, against 32% reporting a positive impact, according to the latest quarterly CBI industrial trends survey. They warned that uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote and the UK\u2019s tariff-free access to European Union markets was undermining confidence, while sterling\u2019s rapid depreciation had pushed up import costs and squeezed profit margins. The number of jobs in the sector is also likely to fall after the survey found that a balance of 15% of manufacturers expect to cut employment over the coming quarter, which is the weakest reading for seven years. The mixed picture was described by the CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s largest employers, as a reaction to uncertainty in the aftermath of the referendum. Chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said businesses were wary of Britain closing its borders to skilled workers from the European Union and failing to win barrier-free access to EU markets, despite taking the opportunity to boost exports after the pound\u2019s 18% fall against the dollar. She said import costs were also proving a headache and could soon lead to rising prices, limiting the potential export gains. The government is under pressure to clarify its stance on Europe and give details of a new industrial strategy. Philip Hammond is due to outline how ministers will support business growth next month in his autumn statement following a pledge by Theresa May for a switch away from the laissez faire policies of her predecessor to more active management of the economy. The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said on Monday it was concerned the Treasury was moving slowly and could miss an opportunity to support the sector\u2019s \u201cambitious growth plans\u201d. Newton-Smith said: \u201cManufacturers are optimistic about export prospects and export orders are growing, following the fall in sterling. \u201cHowever, the weaker pound is also feeding through to costs, which are rising briskly and may well spill over into higher consumer prices in the months ahead. \u201cAccess to skills clearly remains a high priority, so manufacturers will be looking to the government to implement a new migration system that meets the needs of business while responding to clearly stated public concerns. Maintaining a preferential route between the UK and the EU, our largest trading partner, will be important.\u201d The survey of 459 manufacturers found that sterling\u2019s fall meant the UK\u2019s competitiveness in EU markets rose at the fastest pace since the survey began in 2000, with competitiveness outside the bloc also improving at the quickest rate since 2009. But the UK\u2019s improved position failed to halt a decline in optimism about the more general business situation, which fell for the second consecutive quarter, albeit more slowly than the previous sharp decline.",

    "webTitle": "Rising supply of unlet properties curbing rent hikes, say letting agents", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A surge in the supply of rental properties on the books of letting agents is forcing landlords to peg back rent rises, according to an industry body. The proportion of landlords implementing increases fell to 24%, its lowest level this year, said the Association of Residential Letting Agents (Arla, while the number of unlet flats on agency books rose to the highest level for 18 months. Part of the reason is the stamp duty change on second homes, which prompted a rush of buy-to-let purchasers in February and March who were trying to beat the tax increase. But the EU referendum, and the prospect of further buy-to-let tax hikes in 2017, appears not to have dented the appetite of landlords to invest in the market. The number of prospective tenants has also risen, to 40 per lettings branch from 37 in June, defying expectations that the Brexit vote would dampen demand. David Cox, managing director of Arla, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s findings paint a really positive picture for renters. The supply of rental stock has risen astronomically, which suggests it\u2019s not quite right that landlords are pulling out of the market as a result of [the referendum result]. This is supported in our findings, which reveal the number of landlords selling their buy-to-let properties hasn\u2019t changed since April, when three landlords were selling up per branch. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see [fewer] landlords hiking rents this month, but 24% is still too high. The cost of renting is already high in many parts of the country and until the government converts its pledges and promises into bricks and mortar, we will not see renters reach a position where they are able to save to get on the housing ladder. It will be interesting to see how this is tackled in the autumn statement.\u201d Other surveys have also painted a picture of static or falling rents. According to Rightmove, rents fell by 0.7% in London and 0.3% in the south-east in the third quarter of 2016, but were up 2% in the north-west. The upmarket estate agency Knight Frank said rents in prime areas of the capital were down by 4.7% over the past year. Flat or falling rents will bring some relief to tenants who have had to endure huge increases in recent years. According to the GMB union, average rents for two-bedroom apartments have risen to more than 50% of gross average earnings of residents in 16 London boroughs.

The number of prospective tenants has also risen, to 40 per lettings branch from 37 in June, defying expectations that the Brexit vote would dampen demand. </p> <p>David Cox, managing director of Arla, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s findings paint a really positive picture for renters. The supply of rental stock has risen astronomically, which suggests it\u2019s not quite right that landlords are pulling out of the market as a result of [the referendum result].

      "bodyText": "The British economy\u2019s post-Brexit vote bounce is losing momentum as the weak pound and higher inflation herald a squeeze in living standards, according to a Guardian analysis. Although official growth figures to be published on Thursday are likely to show the economy will avoid recession in the second half of the year, the latest Guardian analysis of the post-referendum economy shows a more mixed picture. The most notable shift over the last month was a further sharp fall in the value of the pound. Against the dollar, the pound is lingering around the $1.22 mark \u2013 about 18% lower than on 23 June, the day of the referendum. At one point a \u201cflash crash\u201d in the currency markets pushed the pound briefly to about $1.15. It quickly recovered, but the underlying pressure on the currency has remained following Theresa May\u2019s declaration that she will trigger article 50 before the end of March 2017. The Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE, to track the economy on a monthly basis. The dashboard for October shows that four of the eight categories have performed worse than expected, two were as expected, and two were better. Inflation jumped more sharply than expected to 1%, the highest level in almost two years, Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened, as growth in imports rose faster than exports, and retail sales were flat as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm September. Four months on from the Brexit vote, there are warning signs that consumers should prepare for a renewed squeeze in living standards, as the weak pound drives inflation higher and cautious businesses rein in wage growth. The drop in the pound is starting to be felt by companies. This month Ryanair warned full-year profits would be lower than previously expected and Tesco stocks of Marmite and other household brands were temporarily depleted when the supermarket chain became embroiled in a row over price with the supplier, Unilever. While the Office for National Statistics has cautioned that the post-referendum picture is still emerging, the Guardian\u2019s dashboard shows pressure is building in some parts of the economy. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), David Blanchflower, says Britain is heading for a \u201cBrexit tsunami\u201d. Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, says Britain is already being hit by higher prices, slowing wage growth and - despite official data showing a stable unemployment rate of 4.9% - signs of rising joblessness in underlying ONS figures. Andrew Goodwin, lead UK economist at the forecast group Oxford Economics, also points to looming upward pressure on prices. He says: \u201cBoth the retail sales and inflation releases suggested that price pressures are on the turn. We expect consumer price inflation to accelerate sharply from this point onwards, averaging 2.7% in 2017. This will severely squeeze household spending power and cause spending growth to slow sharply.\u201d Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, told the Guardian that a 1% inflation rate \u201cis the tip of the inflationary iceberg created by the recent fall in the pound\u201d. Meanwhile the public finances worsened. The government had to borrow \u00a32bn more than expected in September to balance the books, partly because of weaker tax receipts. As the outlook for the public coffers deteriorates even before the full impact of any Brexit effects takes hold, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, faces a major challenge next month when he delivers his maiden autumn statement. However, although the scope for giveaways appears to be diminishing, the chancellor is expected to ease the pace of austerity to support the economy. Unemployment held steady at an 11-year low of 4.9%, while the pace of wage growth slowed slightly to 2.3% from 2.4%, as expected. However, fears are building that firms will put hiring decisions on hold and limit wage rises as they seek to rein in costs in an uncertain business environment. On a more positive note, the dashboard indicates the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to a new all-time low of 0.25% in August continues to support confidence in the housing market. The first official estimate of economic growth in the period between between July and September will be published on Thursday and is expected to show growth more than halved to 0.3% from 0.7% in the second quarter. That would be better than many feared in the immediate aftermath of the vote, and better than the 0.1% growth predicted by the Bank of England in August. Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC, writes in the Guardian: \u201cOur economy will be taking a hit over the next year or two in the form of lower growth, but an outright recession should still be avoided.\u201d The International Monetary Fund is predicting the UK will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries this year, with growth of 1.8%. The Washington-based Fund accepted that its prediction of a post-Brexit vote financial crash has proved overly pessimistic. But UK growth is expected to slow considerably in 2017, as the consequences of the Brexit vote place increasing pressure on the UK economy. The dashboard analyses economic performance since April, comparing key indicators with the predictions of those indicators, based on the consensus forecasts in polls of economists by Reuters. \u2022 To find out more about supporting the Guardian\u2019s journalism, please click here",

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009: These are still early days to determine what has happened to the UK economy after the Brexit vote because there are lags before any impact is felt; lags before there are measurable effects; and even longer lags until the data gets published. We only have hard data through August. The bad news already is prices are rising, wage growth is slowing and unemployment is up. The volume of retail sales was flat in September versus August. The fall in the pound has already generated a pick-up in inflation. The consumer prices index was up from 0.6% to 1% in the latest ONS release and is expected to trend steadily higher soon. This is especially bad news for workers whose real wages are still about 7% lower than they were at the pre-recession peak in 2007. Real wages have been on the rise for the last couple of years as inflation tumbled. The latest data for the month of August shows that annual wage growth, not adjusted for inflation, was 2%, down from 2.4% in July. The concern is that by the middle of 2017 prices of goods will start to rise faster than wages, lowering living standards. Unemployment is on the rise again, although it is somewhat unclear by how much because the ONS data is so bad. Estimates range from 10,000 to 144,000 on the month. The ONS last week published data for unemployment for the average of June to August, which it compared with the average of March to May and claimed that the number of unemployed rose by 10,000. But it seems the real jump was likely a lot larger than that. Deep inside the ONS website you can find the underlying monthly data. Here it is in millions. March: 1.73m April: 1.58m May: 1.62m June: 1.71m July: 1.55m August: 1.69m Averages March-May: 1.64m May-July: 1.63m June-August: 1.65m The data shows from the latest single month estimate, which is what every other major country in the world publishes, that unemployment rose 144,000 between July and August. This may be too high, given that these monthly numbers are unstable. If you average the months together as the ONS does, then it is true that unemployment jumped by 10,000, from 1,646,000 in March-May to 1,656,000 in June-August. But that doesn\u2019t seem the right comparator. If you compare the rolling quarter of May to July with June to August, which seems much more sensible, the rise is actually a really worrying \u2013 and more believable \u2013 25,000. Whether the true rise in unemployment is 10,000; 25,000 or 144,000 the rise is bad news of course, as unemployment hurts. This is surely the lull ahead of an oncoming Brexit tsunami. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011: Since the referendum result we have seen some mixed economic indicators. On the consumer side of the economy, growth has been resilient. Even though retail sales were fairly flat in September, third-quarter retail sales volumes were 5.4% up on a year ago. This is roughly in line with the post-crisis high in the fourth quarter of 2014, and before that we have to go back to 2003-04 to find stronger retails sales growth. Consumers, however, have continued to benefit from very low inflation. That is now changing \u2013 with CPI inflation picking up to 1% in September \u2013 though this is the tip of the inflationary iceberg created by the recent fall in the pound. CPI inflation is set to rise to at least 2.5-3% by the end of next year \u2013 and possibly higher. So consumer spending is likely to slow down over the next 12-18 months as inflation bites into the growth of spending power. An economic slowdown is already apparent in the labour market, with job growth easing \u2013 though it remains positive and the unemployment rate is still below 5%. But the key test of how well the economy holds up during the Brexit process will be investment spending. At present, we have limited information about how investment has performed post-Brexit vote. There is anecdotal evidence that businesses are becoming more cautious about investment \u2013 particularly in sectors which could be affected by the UK leaving the EU, such as manufacturing and financial services. But it will take a while for this to feed through to real spending decisions in the UK economy. It will not be until 2017 or 2018 that we see the full investment implications of the uncertainty created by the Brexit referendum decision. Our PwC growth forecast remains at around 1% for next year, about half the recent UK growth rate. That will push the UK down the G7 growth league, below the US, Canada, Germany and France. So our economy will be taking a hit over the next year or two in the form of lower growth, but an outright recession should still be avoided.",

      "bodyText": "The number of UK companies struggling to stay afloat has fallen in a further sign that the economy is holding up after the Brexit vote. In the three months after the referendum on 23 June, the number of firms in significant financial distress fell 6% to 248,916 from the preceding quarter, according to the insolvency company Begbies Traynor. The number of distressed companies fell 2% from a year earlier. Businesses across the UK economy showed resilience with the biggest improvement in the construction sector, where the number of distressed firms fell 11% from the previous quarter. Distressed professional services firms reduced by 10% as work flowed in from clients seeking advice on Brexit, Begbies Traynor said. Ric Traynor, executive chairman, said: \u201cThe UK economy appears to be in a stronger position than expected following the EU referendum result. While we wait to see whether the government opts for a \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit strategy, businesses at least appear to be better placed to tackle any new challenges on the horizon.\u201d The survey cements indications that a much-feared slump in economic activity prompted by uncertainty over Brexit has so far failed to materialise. Economists expect growth to have more than halved in the third quarter but for the economy to have avoided a recession in the second half of the year when GDP figures are released on Thursday. The relative resilience of the economy since the Brexit vote has largely been attributed to consumer willingness to keep spending and strength in the services sector. Surveys soon after the referendum suggested a sharp drop in activity but warm weather and recovery from the initial shock of the vote have supported spending by businesses and households. Some economists still expect a sharp and possibly prolonged slowdown even if Britain avoids a technical recession of two quarters or more of contraction. With divisions in her cabinet over the terms for leaving the EU, Theresa May, the prime minister, has said she will start formal separation, known as article 50, by the end of March 2017. Traynor said: \u201cGiven that the details of the future Brexit deal are as yet unknown, it is still too early to tell what longer-term impact the leave decision might have on the UK economy. Clearly though, the stronger the UK economy becomes pre-Brexit, the better it will be able to withstand any post-Brexit shocks.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher at the start of the new trading week, helped by positive Eurozone data, takeover speculation and a host of upgrades from analysts. Mining shares have been lifted by a positive note on the sector from Barclays, with Antofagasta adding 12.5p to 531p, BHP Billiton 23.5p better at 1244.5p and Rio Tinto rising 43p to 2711.5p. Barclays said: One month on from upgrading our European Mining industry view to Positive, we round up developments on the macro, commodity and equity-specific fronts. Macro data has generally been supportive. Earnings momentum continues to underpin equity outperformance, with upgrade pressure concentrated in the bulk commodities and diversified equities, where valuations remain compelling. We mark to market coking and thermal coal and manganese prices, driving earnings and price target upgrades. Elsewhere easyJet has climbed 22p to 940.5p after UBS moved from neutral to buy: On the back of three profit warnings (since the end of June) we have seen the easyJet share price nearly halve since the start of the year. However, we upgrade the shares to Buy and highlight (1) Shares are pricing in material future value destruction \u2013 we don\u2019t think this will be the case (2) The shares have materially de-rated and we think look attractive (3) Earnings forecast risk for 2017 in our view is now balanced, and (4) Post expansion capex the free cashflow and return on invested capital look attractive. Overall the FTSE 100 is 19.45 points better at 7039.92, albeit underperforming rival European markets after the positive eurozone purchasing managers reports. With AT&amp;T agreeing to take over Time Warner for \u00a370bn, media shares are in focus, and ITV has added 2.8p to 173.8p. Provident Financial is up 75p at \u00a330.80 as Goldman Sachs raised its target price from \u00a325.70 to \u00a330. But Royal Bank of Scotland, which has paid a consortium \u00a3180m to back an aborted attempt to float 300 branches on the stock market, is down 3.5p at 186.5p as Investec moved from hold to sell. Analyst Ian Gordon said: The RBS share price is up 12% in 4 days. Although our underlying and/or near-term expectations are largely unchanged, we think that RBS now faces a potentially even less favourable environment for conduct resolution. In truth, our forecasts here remain substantially guesswork, (and therefore highly unsatisfactory), but in particular, we now assume that settlement of the GRG debacle [where the bank faces claims from small businesses] may have a material cost attached to it. We also fear further \u201cfine inflation\u201d in the US. Gordon added: There is little real visibility on the financial fall-out from GRG. Andrew Tyrie MP comments that \u201cRBS have said that they will consider the question of redress after publication of the FCA\u2019s report\u201d. We think that both timing and amount remains highly uncertain, but we now model a \u00a3500m charge in the fourth quarter of 2016... We still do not know precisely what hedging RBS has in place for as yet unprovided, but \u201canticipated\u201d conduct settlements, in particular in relation to the US Department of Justice. The view of Investec Economics is that \u201cHillary Clinton now looks a near shoo-in to beat Donald Trump\u201d. We think this may prove detrimental to RBS\u2019 negotiating position (and that of other banks under investigation). In aggregate, we raise our incremental conduct charge forecast through the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018 to \u00a36.4bn (from \u00a34.8bn). InterContinental Hotels has fallen 18p to \u00a331.42 as Kepler Cheuvreux moved from hold to reduce. Among the mid-caps Petra Diamonds has put on after a positive first quarter production update, but defence group Cobham has dropped 18% to 131p after it downgraded its profit forecast for the second time this year. But French Connection has jumped 16% to 38p following a report that it could be attracting overseas or private equity predators, with US firm Neuberger Berman and Rutland Partners mentioned.",

      "bodyText": "Cobham has published its second profit warning in six months after several of the engineering company\u2019s divisions performed worse than expected. In an update, Cobham said trading profit for the year to 31 December will fall by up to 23% to between \u00a3255m and \u00a3275m from \u00a3332.2m. As a result, the company\u2019s debt will be 2.6 times its earnings compared with a ratio of 2.3 at the end of June. The shares, which have fallen more than 40% this year, tumbled almost 15% to 137p. Cobham, which supplies radar and other electronic products for industries including defence and aviation, warned in April that annual profit would be lower than expected. The company completed a \u00a3500m rights issue in June to strengthen its finances, which were weakened partly by debt taken on to buy Aeroflex, a US maker of components for wireless communications systems, in 2014. The Aeroflex purchase was meant to broaden Cobham\u2019s business to cushion the impact of defence cuts, but it has not lived up to expectations. The former Aeroflex business was one of the poorly performing divisions in the third quarter of the year, together with maritime satellite communications and electronic defence products. Cobham said: \u201cFollowing the underperformance in the third quarter, the group expects an improvement in fourth-quarter trading from increased volumes in a number of areas. Despite this, the group\u2019s anticipated full-year outcome is now below the board\u2019s previous expectations, largely resulting from a continuation of issues seen in the year to date.\u201d The FTSE 250 company announced in August it would replace Bob Murphy as chief executive with David Lockwood, the boss of Laird. Lockwood is due to join by the end of the year along with a new finance director, David Mellors. Profits fell 36% in the first half of the year, leaving Cobham needing a big improvement in performance to meet annual targets.

      "bodyText": "An all-Australian consortium bidding $386m for the S Kidman and Co cattle empire has confirmed it would divide most of the Kidman land between the four families involved in the deal. Sterling Buntine, Tom Brinkworth, Malcolm Harris and Viv Oldfield have put together the $386m bid under the BBHO consortium. It is seeking to outgun a $365m bid by the Gina Rinehart-led joint venture company Australian Outback Beef (AOB), in which Hancock would own 67% of S Kidman and Co, with the Chinese-owned Shanghai Cred to hold the other third. Buntine said if BBHO\u2019s bid for the company were successful, the S Kidman brand would continue, with its herd of 150,000 cattle jumping to more than 550,000, but some of the land would be split. \u201cSome of the properties will be kept in this S Kidman and company, [with] those properties that are most strategic to go into the marketing and distribution business,\u201d Buntine told the ABC. \u201cBut the other properties which will be 80-90% of those properties will drop back into the individual syndicate families\u2019 individual companies.\u201d The Kidman company had previously indicated its preference was for the properties to stay in one parcel. Buntine said he did not consider the breakup of land between the four families to be a problem, given that they were Australian grazing families. The $386m BBHO offer also includes the Anna Creek station, which has an area up to 26,000 hectares adjacent to the Woomera weapons testing range. AOB\u2019s $365m bid does not include Anna Creek, which means the two bids are of similar value. The offer by Rinehart-AOB secured it \u201cpreferred bidder\u201d status. It would require Foreign Investment Review Board approval, but it would represent a 1% lower foreign ownership than is now the case. In April the treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium because it could have been contrary to the \u201cnational interest\u201d. Kidman\u2019s assets comprise 101,411 sq km \u2013 2.5% of Australia\u2019s agricultural land or 1.3% of its land mass, stretching across Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. Last week, when news of the BBHO bid broke, Hancock Prospecting\u2019s chief executive, Garry Korte, said the 18-month sales process had been extensive and exhausting. \u201cIt is a pity that one party chose not to meet those minimum requirements and is now seeking political favours to change the rules after the siren has sounded,\u201d Korte said. But Buntine, who held a press conference in parliament last week, said BBHO was not asking for \u201cpolitical favours\u201d. \u201cWe hope that there is more money on the table and there is a lower execution risk, we hope that will give us the win on this,\u201d Buntine said. A spokesman for S Kidman and Co confirmed the BBHO bid had been received but would not discuss the details of any bids. \u201cAs we have already indicated, Kidman\u2019s status as a public unlisted company with more than 50 shareholders means that under-bidders or parties not directly participating in the sale process still have an opportunity to submit a takeover offer,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cAt any time throughout the process until the takeover offer closes, parties can submit a superior counter-proposal for acquisition of the company.\u201d The spokeswoman said if a superior counter-proposal were received, it would be assessed by the Kidman board. Under its agreement with Kidman, AOB has the right to match the bid. \u201cIf it is judged to be a superior proposal, and AOB do not exercise their matching right under the bid implementation agreement, directors have a duty to put that superior proposal to shareholders,\u201d the spokeswoman said. S Kidman and Co, founded in 1899 by Sir Sidney Kidman, remains Australia\u2019s largest private landholder. The company operates 10 cattle stations, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot. Given that 98% of the land is held under pastoral lease, the bid would require state government approval for the transfer of leases to the new owners. BBHO has submitted its bid for 100% of the Kidman shares and is conditional on acquiring at least 90% of shares. Nick Xenophon said there was a fundamental flaw in the Foreign Investment Review Board laws, which were blind to any local bids which might be on \u201cequivalent terms\u201d. Xenophon said the BBHO bid was unconditional and in excess of the ABO bid \u201cso you would think it was in the box seat\u201d. He added: \u201cThe concern here is that the Foreign Investment Review Board could wave the Rinehart-Shanghai bid through despite that there is a credible alternative bid that is 100% Australian. \u201cThat is a flaw in our current Foreign Investment Review framework and it needs to be reformed. \u201cWe need to fix the flaws, the loopholes in our current foreign investment framework which basically means there isn\u2019t a level playing field if you are 100% Australian consortium that is putting up a credible alternative bid.\u201d Xenophon said he hoped the Kidman sale was not a \u201cdone deal\u201d. \u201cIt is important that any bid led by Gina Rinehart is treated equally compared to the 100% Australian bid. \u201cI have nothing against Gina Rinehart, I have never met the woman, but I just want it to be absolutely transparent that any process ensures that a local bid gets the same fair treatment as any bid that involves overseas interests.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US telecoms giant AT&amp;T has agreed to buy Time Warner, the owner of the Harry Potter and Batman film franchises as well as HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network, for $85.4bn (\u00a370bn), creating a new media behemoth that will control both content and its distribution. The deal has prompted political concern. On Saturday, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, promised to block it because it would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, said he was \u201cpro-competition\u201d. The companies\u2019 bosses announced late on Saturday night that they had signed a deal \u2013 the biggest corporate takeover of the year \u2013 which was a \u201cperfect match\u201d of firms to \u201cbring a fresh approach to how the media and communications industry works\u201d. The deal, unanimously approved by both companies\u2019 boards, values Time Warner at $107.50 a share \u2013 a 20% premium on its closing price on Friday. It unites a historic phone company that traces its roots back more than 130 years to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, with the producer of some of the world\u2019s most popular movies and TV shows, including Veep and Game of Thrones. AT&amp;T and Time Warner would have combined market value of more than $310bn. If the deal goes through and the companies aren\u2019t forced to sell assets, it would have AT&amp;T\u2019s assets of more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV, which AT&amp;T bought for $50bn in 2015, as well as Time Warner\u2019s extensive collection of Hollywood movies and TV channels and productions. Time Warner owns Warner Brothers (Harry Potter and Batman) as well as HBO, CNN and DC Comics. It also holds a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu. Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive, who will lead the combined company, said the corporate tie-up would transform consumers\u2019 experience of watching media on their phones at a time when many young people are giving up on pay TV. \u201cWe believe premium content is always going to win,\u201d he said, on a late night conference call announcing the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s been true on the big screen, the TV screen and we believe it is true on the mobile screen. \u201cWhen we combine Time Warner content with our scale and distribution \u2026 we\u2019re going to have something really special.\u201d The deal faces the prospect of a tough battle with politicians and regulators fearful that such a tie-up could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a possible threat to media plurality. Trump has vowed to block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election. In a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, he said it would give the combined company \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d. Speaking about his continuing battle with the \u201cdishonest mainstream media\u201d, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people. \u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d Trump said he would also consider \u201cbreaking\u201d up the last big media deal, Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBC Universal in 2013. \u201cDeals like this destroy democracy,\u201d he said. On Sunday, Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to Trump, said the deal was evidence of the \u201cmonopoly power of media conglomerates\u201d. \u201cAT&amp;T, the original and abusive \u201cMa Bell\u201d telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly anti-Trump CNN,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cDonald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few.\u201d Hillary Clinton did not immediately comment but she has promised to bring in tougher scrutiny on big corporations. Earlier this month she vowed to \u201cstrengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinise mergers and acquisitions, so the big don\u2019t keep getting bigger and bigger\u201d. Kaine told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m pro-competition. Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.\u201d Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon later told reporters there were \u201ca number of questions and concerns\u201d about the deal but said that more needed to be known \u201cbefore any conclusions should be reached.\u201d Al Franken, a Democratic senator for Minnesota and regular critic of other cable and media tie-ups, said: \u201cI\u2019m skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices and even worse service for consumers.\u201d Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, said in a joint statement: \u201cAn acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine.\u201d A spokesman for Lee later said a hearing would be held sometime this year. The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are also likely to review the deal, which comes shortly after cable provider Comcast took full control of NBC Universal. It is expected that the combined AT&amp;T/Time Warner group will have to promise to provide competitor content the same access to its customers as its own content. Disney executives have called for \u201cvery close regulatory scrutiny\u201d of the deal. Stephenson, who said he hoped the deal would be completed next year, said he did not expect any significant challenge from regulators as AT&amp;T is not buying up a direct competitor but adding to its business by purchasing a supplier. \u201cThis is not a horizontal deal. This is vertical merger,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find examples where vertical mergers have been blocked.\u201d Craig Aaron, president of the consumer watchdog Free Press, said the deal would concentrate a \u201chuge amount of media power under one corporate umbrella\u201d and would likely lead to less customer choice and higher prices. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear lots in the months ahead about supposed benefits, but history shows that mega-deals like this lead to higher prices, fewer choices and too much power in too few hands,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWall Street pushes these deals for short-term gains but they\u2019re ultimately bad for business, larger economic growth and especially content creators and consumers. This deal will be a huge test about whether the next president is serious about antitrust. If they are, they\u2019ll move to block this deal.\u201d Richard Greenfield, a media and technology at research firm BTIG, said the deal showed that Time Warner believes \u201cthe entire legacy media world is headed [for] secular decline\u201d. He said Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chairman and chief executive, would end up being remembered as \u201cthe smartest CEO in sector \u2013 knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders\u201d. Bewkes, who turned down an $85-a-share takeover approach from 21st Century Fox two years ago, said he would stay with the company for a handover period before stepping down. He said he also expects all of his company\u2019s creative and business executives to stay on \u201cfor a number of years\u201d. The deal comes as telecoms companies are desperately trying to buy up entertainment content to differentiate themselves from competitors and prevent themselves from becoming just \u201cdumb pipes\u201d, providing content from other companies. AT&amp;T\u2019s biggest rival, Verizon, is in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of the Huffington Post. The AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal is on another level, and Stephenson said the company would become the first US mobile phone company to directly compete with cable TV companies by providing a bundle of online video content similar to a pay-TV package. In their announcement of the deal, the two companies said: \u201cIt will disrupt the traditional entertainment model and push the boundaries on mobile content availability for the benefit of customers.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest media companies Comcast The world\u2019s biggest media conglomerate, according to the 2016 Forbes Global 2000 list, has annual revenue of $74.5bn, a market value of $153bn and more than 150,000 employees. The Philadelphia-based company supplies cable to 40 states and DC and also owns NBC Universal, owner of one of the US\u2019s \u201cbig three\u201d TV networks and Universal Studios and its theme parks. Walt Disney Founded by Walter Elias \u201cWalt\u201d Disney in 1923, the company most famous for Mickey Mouse has become a conglomerate covering TV, movies and theme parks. It has a market value of $150bn and annual sales of $54bn. As well as Walt Disney Studios, it owns the broadcast TV network ABC and several cable networks, including Disney Channel, ESPN and A+E Networks. 21st Century Fox The Murdoch family company, formed when the news assets and entertainment assets of News Corp were split in 2013, has a market value of $48bn. Its assets include the 20th Century Fox film studio, the Fox television network, the Asian pay-TV channel STAR TV and a 39.14% stake in Sky TV. CBS Formerly known as Columbia Broadcasting System, CBS is worth $26bn and makes annual revenue of $13.9bn. Another of the big three US TV networks, it also owns Showtime and The Movie Channel and CBS Radio. Viacom Spun out of CBS in 2005, Viacom has a market value of $15bn and owns Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV and VH1, Comedy Central and Channel 5 in the UK.",
