      "bodyText": "The first day of the World Economic Forum is nearly over, so we\u2019re going to take a break. I\u2019ll be back if there are any major developments - in the meantime, here\u2019s our news story on president Xi\u2019s visit: Columbian singer Shakira, who collected a WEF Crystal Award last night, has been discussing her work building schools in the most downtrodden parts of the country: \u201cSometimes we encounter a tremendous lack of infrastructure. No portable water in many cases, no electricity, no paved roads, so it definitely means that we have to work twice as hard in order to offer a quality education.\u201d Not only that, but many of the children concerned are affected by violence or have lost family members. John Kerry also urged Europe to \u201cbelieve in itself\u201d, and remember that European integration was driven by the need to stop European\u2019s killing each other. \u201cIt\u2019s worked, folks!, said Kerry, adding: \u201cOn the face of the planet, no assembly of countries has grown as significantly and powerfully as Europe. Away from Davos again, and European markets have closed for the day, with the UK the focus of attention. A positive reaction to UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech, notably the promise that parliament would be able to vote on any deal with the U, helped push the pound almost 3% higher, its biggest daily rise since 1998. Sterling was already edging higher before the speech, recovering some ground after the government\u2019s hard Brexit suggestions at the weekend. A weak US dollar as Donald Trump said the American currency was overvalued helped here, as did stronger than expected UK inflation figures which suggested the next move in UK interest rates would be upwards. The jump in the pound, conversely, knocked back the FTSE 100, which recorded its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last June. The FTSE 100 has been boosted for several months by the fall in the pound, which helps the overseas earners and exporters which dominate the leading index. So the rise in sterling - which is currently 2.8% higher against the dollar at $1.2382 and up 1.87% against the euro at \u20ac1.1577 - has had the opposite effect, and the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.46% to 7220.38. European markets have edged lower, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.13% and France\u2019s Cac closing 0.46% lower. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 29 points or 0.15%. President Xi\u2019s trip to Switzerland is already making headlines: John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, has cited the Iran nuclear deal as proof that engaging with other nations to deliver peace can pay off. On his final trip to Europe before leaving office, Kerry told Davos that the Iran deal was one of the successes of the Obama presidency, and proof that diplomacy works. Kerry says: There are now no longer 19,000 centrifuges spinning and enriching, there are 5,000, which is the agreement. There is no longer a 12,000 kg stockpile that could produce 10 to 12 bombs. There\u2019s 300kg, measurable every day. And you can\u2019t build a bomb with 300kg. This is an agreement that can endure, he adds. Donald Trump has criticised the Iran deal, raising concerns that it could unravel. Kerry, though, insists it can last. Take Iran. If the United States were to decide suddenly that we\u2019re not going to pursue this, I bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this with us will get together, and Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain will say \u2018this is a good deal, we\u2019re going to keep it. And we\u2019ll have done a great injury to ourselves. And it will hurt for a year, two years, while the administration is there  . Kerry also cites the Paris climate change agreement, progress towards ending the war in Yemen, as reasons to be optimistic about the future. And he say he won\u2019t guess whether Trump really believes some of the things he\u2019s said in the race for the White House. Hollywood Matt Damon is talking to the press about his Water.org charity, and the challenges in raising money. Water.org wants to guarantee clean water for everyone in the world; a great goal, but one which hasn\u2019t been easy to attract funding. Damon says: We\u2019ve tried humour -- a few years ago I went on a toilet strike for an entire year. One of the first hurdles we\u2019ve had to clear in the West is that it\u2019s very hard for people to relate to this issue. If you grew up in Europe, if you grew up in America, you\u2019ve never been thirsty in your entire life and you\u2019ve never been five metres away from a clean drink water. The water in our toilet is cleaner than the water that 663m people have access to. Damon adds that he has very high hopes for a partnership with Stella Artois, the brewer. This will mean extra funding for Water.org, which provides affortable micro-loans to help communities install clean water equipment. You can go into a pub in the UK or America and buy a pint of Stella, and for that one pint of Stella, they will guarantee bringing someone in the developing world clean water for a month. S&amp;P\u2019s Paul Sheard also believes President Xi genuinely wants to avoid a trade war (one of the key points of his pro-gobalisation speech this morning). Sheard explains that China would come off worse than America if globalisation and free trade falters. If you did go into a trade ice age, who would be better placed to survive it, economically? I think the answer is the US, because the US is a very large economy, resource rich, with a very large population. Smaller export-driven countries such as Mexico would obviously suffer more, while China (although a huge economy) is still in the development phase. China has got more to lose in terms of making sure that process of economic development continues than the US would. That doesn\u2019t make it a good thing to go that way, but just in terms of the relative economic costs, it would be higher. But.... a one-party state like China is in a better state to survive the political consequences of a trade war, while President Trump could suffer an electoral backlash. Sheard says: It\u2019s not clear that Trump has the upper hand. You\u2019ve got the mid-terms in two years. If it\u2019s like \u2018oh my god this guy screwed up\u2019, he\u2019s on a short fuse. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P, says Anthony Scaramucci is on a one-man mission to explain Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies to Davos this week. Speaking to me at Davos, Sheard explains: Scaramucci went a long way at this meeting to clarifying, probably for many people, what the basic intent of the Trump administration is likely to be. Trump\u2019s been talking about free - he\u2019s a big supporter of free trade - but he also wants to be fair trade. That means \u201cWe\u2019ll open to you, but you\u2019ve got to open to us. As we covered earlier, Scaramucci insisted that the US is committed to free trade - but wants more \u201csymmetry\u201d (rather than letting the other country get the best of the deal). The FT\u2019s Gillian Tett has a good write-up here: Away from Davos for a moment, and Wall Street has opened lower after president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s comments that the dollar was overvalued knocked the US currency lower. In turn, a falling greenback plus higher than expected UK inflation and a positive response to prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech - notably the line that parliament will be able to vote on any deal - has boosted the pound and pushed the FTSE 100 lower. The index is full of dollar earners who have benefited from the weak pound in recent months but are now heading lower as sterling strengthens. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned after the Martin Luther King day break with a 62 point or 0.33% decline. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 1% at 7247, on track for its biggest one day fall since November, while European markets have also edged lower. As for the pound, it is currently 2.6% higher and on track for its best daily performance since December 2008. IHS Markit chief economist Dr Nariman Behravesh agrees that president Xi\u2019s speech on globalisation and free trade was \u201cvery encouraging\u201d; but the real test is whether he delivers on it. President Xi gave a very rigorous and articulate defence of globalisation. Essentially, he said that we should not blame all the world\u2019s problems on globalisation and that the benefits outweigh the costs. Very importantly, he made commitments about opening China up to more imports and foreign direct investment and making sure that China\u2019s exchange rate policy didn\u2019t destabilize the global economy. All this is very encouraging. However, actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China does. This is a good start. This is a good set of commitments on his part. It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is. Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci is speaking again \u2013 and insisting that the next US government doesn\u2019t want a trade war either. Scaramucci says the president-elect wants a very strong relationship with China: Scaramucci also talking in desperately glowing terms about how Donald Trump won the US election, and why he joined the Trump campaign. Scaramucci says he realised that Trump was on to something after he met with visitors to a rally. The common thread was that they were on government assistance because factories had been closed. Scaramucci says: And I started going through the crowd, and I thought \u2018oh my god, these are the people I grew up with\u2019. The \u201cgreat irony of this story\u201d is that it was a billionaire real estate developer who picked up on these concerns and offered solutions, Scaramucci adds. Scaramucci claims there\u2019s only one (!) negative with Trump \u2013 he\u2019s always on the go. I don\u2019t know when he sleeps.... We need to outwork him, and it\u2019s not possible. He criticises the media for assuming that Trump\u2019s huge rallies wouldn\u2019t actually translate into votes on election day. If someone is willing to wait in the rain for eight hours outside an arena, do you think they\u2019re not going to show up and vote? On other politicians, Scaramucci says the president-elect has \u201ca tremendous amount of respect for chancellor Merkel, and president Putin\u201d. Scaramucci insist that Trump isn\u2019t at all racist (despite his comments about Mexicans, muslims and immigrants during the campaign - and that barney with the respected civil rights leader John Lewis last week). But what about the big issue of Nato? Does Trump really think it\u2019s obsolete? Scaramucci says the alliance needs radical reforms to adjust to today\u2019s political climate; comments that may not reassure the Baltic states. Environmental campaigners have welcomed President Xi\u2019s call for leaders to stick with the Paris Climate Change deal. Here\u2019s Li Shuo, Senior Global Policy Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia: \u201cGiven the current volatility of global politics, President Xi Jinping\u2019s address today in Davos helped calm nerves. His reference to climate change highlights a growing sense of China\u2019s international responsibility, and the country\u2019s evolving calculus towards taking action on the issue. \u201cAs Mr. Trump drops President Obama\u2019s climate legacy, Mr. Xi might well establish one of his own. 2017 presents a real opportunity for China to rise to the challenge of responsible climate leadership. Having moved from climate villain to a reluctant leader in five short years over the first half of this decade, it\u2019s reasonable to expect China to become a true leader by its end.\u201d The global elite who gather at Davos each January have waited more than 40 years for a Chinese president to address them. And Xi Jinping was worth the wait, delivering a rollicking defence of globalisation that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past. While the hall was packed out with business leaders and politicians, many of Xi\u2019s remarks were aimed at one person who certainly isn\u2019t at Davos - Donald Trump. The key moment was probably when Xi insisted that a trade war would be in no-one\u2019s interests, and dismissed protectionism as simply locking oneself in a dark room. His pointed reminders about the strength of the Chinese economy - all those tourists, all that trade - were another jibe at those who think world trade has gone too far. And by stoutly defending globalisation, Xi is hoping that other world leaders might be on his side if relations with Washington deteriorate. The speech definitely went down well in Davos, and beyond: Of course; these speeches are often notable for what\u2019s missing; Xi didn\u2019t talk about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet. And his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won\u2019t comfort those in the west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade. Experienced China-watched George Magnus, former chief economist of UBS, isn\u2019t convinced that the president will live up to the vision he laid out today. But still -- a speech to remember, not least because who gave it; 2017 is going to be another year to remember. China\u2019s president Xi may have played to a packed house at Davos, but there was another key player on delegates\u2019 minds - and apparently Xi\u2019s too - while not even being there. That person of course is Donald Trump. Larry Elliott writes: Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos feels this year. The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his inauguration in Washington later this week. Donald Trump is dominating proceedings. The survey of business executives conducted by PwC showed that companies are worried by Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande. But Trump\u2019s influence can be felt in other ways. The manner in which he won the US election, tapping in to deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution of the spoils of economic growth, has been noted. There is talk in Davos of the need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone. Larry\u2019s full piece is here: President Xi sums up with a call for world leaders to stick with globalisation. When encountering trouble we should not blame others, or run away, he declares, adding: History is created by the brave - let us boost confidence, take action, and work together for a bright future. And that\u2019s it! WEF founder Klaus Schwab thanks Xi for bringing some sunshine to Davos; I\u2019ll pull together some more reaction now.... In conclusion, Xi says that China\u2019s economy is now entering a \u2018new normal\u2019 (after many years of double-digit growth). We have 1.3 billion people, and their living standards are not yet high. The aim is to achieve \u201cmedium to high\u201d level growth, and move the economy to the higher end of the supply chain. Xi talks about the need to strengthen property rights in China, and make its economy better regulated. And then he drops some loud hints that the world economy needs China. Over the coming five years, China expects to import $8 trillion of US goods and make $750bn of outbound investment, and Chinese tourists will make 700m visits overseas. Xi declares: China will keep its door wide open, and not close it. And we hope that other countries will keep their doors open, and maintain a level playing field, Xi adds -- another nudge at president-elect Trump. And Xi promises that he won\u2019t launch a currency war, or devalue the yuan. Xi urges leaders in Davos not to abandon the historic climate change agreed in Paris in December 2015: Xi now turns to China\u2019s own progress, saying its \u201cpeople-oriented philosophy\u201d has lifted 700 million people out of poverty. \u201cAll roads lead to Rome\u201d, he declares, but that doesn\u2019t mean that what works for one country works for another. Piling ever more cliches on his audience, Xi says China knows there is no such thing as a free lunch, and no \u201cpie will fall from the sky\u201d. He\u2019s now explaining that China\u2019s moves to opening its economy has been a boost to the whole global economy; and the country isn\u2019t jealous of other people\u2019s success (which I think is a nudge to other leaders not to blame Beijing for their ills). A ripple of applause rings out across the conference hall as president Xi declares that \u201cno-one will emerge as a winner in a trade war\u201d. In remarks that could well be aimed at president-elect Trump, Xi he tells WEF that global leaders must push for open and willing cooperation\u201d, rather than nipping back to the harbour every time there is a storm. Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. Wind and rain may be kept outside, but so is light and air. Xi now turns to \u201cworrying\u201d levels of economic inequality. One percent of the population control as much wealth as the remaining 99%, he says; The fundamental problem facing the global economy is the lack of a driving force for growth. We must relentlessly pursue innovation, to find ways to push growth rates up. Xi now turns to the problems in the global economy,. The path to sustainable solid growth remains elusive, he says, and then singles out \u201cinadequate\u201d governance in the financial markets. Trade and investment rules has not kept pace with other developments, he warns: Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you can\u2019t escape from, Xi continues. Any attempt to cut off the glow of capital, goods, and people between economies and channel the waters into the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible. Ina speech ripe with analogies, Xi declares that China\u2019s move towards open markets has been choppy -- with plenty of whirlpools and choking along the way. But we have learned to survive, and we must have the courage to keep swimming in the global market. The financial crisis was caused by \u201cchasing profits\u201d and failed regulation, not globalisation, says Xi. The voices attacking globalisation have laid bare the pitfalls facing globalisation, and we need to take this seriously, the Chinese president continues. Xi quotes a Chinese proverb that \u201cHoney melons hang from bitter vines\u201d. Nothing is perfect in this world, he continues. President Xi he insists that there is \u201cno point\u201d blaming globalisation for all the problems facing the world. He cites the flow of refugees from the Middle East and Africa - a global concern, but not one caused by opening up markets. War, conflict and regional turmoil that have caused these problems, says Xi. The solution is in promising peace and restoring stability. President Xi begins his speech by quoting Charles Dickens -- and his famous line that \u201cIt was the best of time, it was the worst of times\u201d. We live in a time of incredible change, Xi tells Davos. We face global challenges like terrorism and refugees. Many people are wondering - what has gone wrong with our world? Economic globalisation was once seen as the treasure in the cave found by Ali Baba -- now it is seen as Pandora\u2019s box, he continues. And we\u2019re off! Here\u2019s a live feed of president Xi\u2019s speech: WEF founder Klaus Schwab is giving president Xi Jinping a typically effusive welcome, congratulating the Chinese leader for his country\u2019s growth record and hailing his leadership on issues such as climate change. No mention of human rights issues or internet censorship, mind you... There\u2019s a massive buzz across the World Economic Forum right now, as we wait to hear from president Xi Jinping. The main hall is absolutely packed --- they\u2019re turning people away at the door --such is the interest in the first Chinese president to address WEF. Anthony Scaramucci has told ITV News that Britain will be at the \u2018front of the line\u2019 for a trade deal, reversing president Obama\u2019s \u2018back of the queue\u2019 warning before June\u2019s vote. Anthony Scaramucci, one of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisors, is making some fascinating comments about monetary policy here in Davos. Scaramucci is arguing that only 3% of the world population benefitted from unorthodox monetary policy such as quantitative easing, leaving the other 97% behind: \u201cA global crisis forced a massive monetary intervention. It was a success but a by-product was asset reflation. 97% of global citizens did not get an uplift.\u201d [central banks used QE to buy up government bonds, which pushed up asset prices as banks invested in riskier things] Scaramucci said he was from a working class family but didn\u2019t see the current system delivering for aspirational Americans. Politicians need to reconnect with the rest of the population, and find economic policies that benefit them too, he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that anymore. The top 3% are back where they were in 2007. The other 97% are struggling. We\u2019ve got to listen to the people.\u201d Scaramucci also argues that Trump could be followed by a left-wing president in 2020, if he doesn\u2019t make the situation better. That\u2019s music to Bernie Sanders supporters\u2019 ears.... Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, said: Inflation is back with a vengeance. The weakening pound continues to drive prices higher and today\u2019s CPI reading of 1.6% on the back of rising fuel, food and air fares is significantly higher than expected. With more hints from the UK Government that a hard Brexit is on the cards, we could see sterling fall even further in the lead up to the Prime Minister pulling the trigger on Article 50. This will translate into further inflation in the short term. Indeed, some of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers have already warned that they may have to raise prices as they are forced to pass on higher costs of importing goods from abroad to customers. A rise in UK interest rates is in prospect as inflation rises, says Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade: Although inflation hitting a two-year high is a sign of a strong economy, and those on the other side of The Channel would hope for some of the same, today\u2019s CPI data could sound alarm bells for the Bank of England. The pound is shaking amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and consumer spending, which has proved vital in helping the economy recover from June\u2019s referendum, is likely to dry up. Inflation could rise as high as 3% this year, surely leaving Mark Carney and the BoE considering an interest rate hike. The inflation figure is the highest level since mid-2014, with higher air fares and the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote fuelling the price rises. Food prices were higher after the sterling slump (remember Marmitegate?) and there was also a smaller fall in petrol prices than in December 2015, following the recovery in the crude price since then. The move pushes inflation closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. In November the Bank forecast it would exceed 2.7% by the end of this year as the pound\u2019s slump pushes up the price of imports, and these figures are showing signs of that effect. NF Breaking news: UK inflation came in higher than expected in December, with the Bank of England\u2019s preferred CPI measurement up 1.6% compared to 1.2% in the previous month and expectations of 1.4%. The chairman of HSBC has criticised those who argue that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote was a vote for free trade. Speaking in Davos this morning, Douglas Flint was asked whether voters in the North of England were voting for free trade when they ticked the \u201cNo\u201d box in last June\u2019s referendum, as some Brexiteers have argued. Flint dismissed the idea as \u201cextraordinary\u201d: No, I think they were voting to leave the EU. I think the interpretation of the vote is extraordinary, just as it is in the US as well. People can have theories, but at the end of the day certainly in relation to Brexit there was a single question on the voting slip and that\u2019s what people voted for. They voted to leave Europe, whatever was in their minds that caused them to vote that way is up to them. The priority now is to implement Brexit, in as painless a way as possible, Flint continued. Lot of people can have theories, usually backing up their own perception....but we\u2019ve had a vote, and we\u2019re now in the implementation phase, of what does that mean and how to you execute it in a way that does the least harm to the EU 27 and the UK and can be completed as efficiently and quickly as possible. Flint says that HSBC is now doing a \u201chuge amount of work\u201d helping clients understand what Brexit means. Their supply chains may be \u2018longer and clunkier\u2019 than before, and revenue may take longer to flow through. The \u201creal challenge\u201d is helping small and medium-sized forms who haven\u2019t had to think about these issues for the last 40 years, as they were part of the single market. Flint reminded his audience that the City had coped extremely well with the turbulence in the markets after June 23; that\u2019s a reason not to fragment London\u2019s financial system. Very few financial systems in the world that could cope with that event, there was so much volatility, and nothing broke, Flint said. What exists in London today is the aggregation of decades of experience, risk management, and so forth, he added. Fragmenting that across New York, Singapore, etc would go against efforts to reduce risks in the financial sector. Flint also warned that Europe\u2019s economy could suffer if the Brexit deal hurts the City: One of the dangers is that the aggregate supply of financial capacity to the economy of Europe drops in two years time, which would not be consistent with trying to grow the economy. One of the attendees at Davos is the head of the world\u2019s biggest fund manager Blackrock, which has been making headlines in the financial world by attacking executive pay and becoming the largest shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group. Jill Treanor has the background: Among the 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists and celebrities attending this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos will be a 64-year-old with receding hair and rimless glasses. The academic demeanour of Larry Fink belies his role running BlackRock, an outfit he founded 30 years ago and which has become the biggest fund manager on the planet, overseeing $5.1tn (\u00a34.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers. The sheer size of the operation \u2013 the UK economy is worth \u00a31.8tn \u2013 puts Fink at the helm of an international powerhouse, with tentacles across markets for stocks and bonds around the globe. In the UK alone, BlackRock is usually found among the top three shareholders in FTSE 100 blue-chip companies. Last week it pipped the UK government to become the biggest investor in Lloyds Banking Group. While Fink makes regular appearances at major events such as Davos \u2013 this year he is to opine on the global economy \u2013 BlackRock is not known for its public pronouncements. It does not provide specific detail on its shareholdings in each company or offer opinions on individual investments. However, there are signs that it may be about to become more vocal in public after its UK arm fired off a letter to the boards of the biggest 350 companies listed in London to urge them to rein in executive pay. Jill\u2019s full piece is here: Perhaps Davos 2018 should have more hairdressers and fewer politicians, based on this research: Political scientist Ian Bremmer is also tweeting some good stuff about the changes coming up in the world of work: We just caught up with John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd\u2019s of London, about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Nelson was a \u201cremainer\u201d but says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had all the arguments about the various options. We are leaving. We\u2019ve got to get used to it. Let\u2019s get cracking. The sooner we get negotiations going the better. We need decisions at the top.\u201d Nelson said the signs ahead of Theresa May\u2019s speech were that the UK would not have access to the single market after Brexit, and the City would lose the passporting rights that allow staff to work across the EU. \u201cWe need to make the best of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to discriminate against the UK as a punishment. It is in everyone\u2019s interests to have as much free trade as possible. But I don\u2019t expect a special deal.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s is setting up a European subsidiary to get round the passporting issue. The location of the office will be announced in the next three months, Nelson said. Nelson also had mixed feelings about the arrival in the White House of Donald Trump. He expressed concern about the president elect\u2019s views on climate change - a key issue for the insurance industry - but thinks Trump could stimulate growth. \u201cClimate change is a long-term problem. Our concern is that Trump will reverse the slow progress that has been make. It will put humanity at risk if we continue to blow carbon into the air.\u201d Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has been predicting tense times in the world\u2019s government bond markets, once Donald Trump gets his hands on the keys to the White House: Theresa May\u2019s upcoming speech on Britain\u2019s exit strategy is the talk of Davos this morning. Yesterday\u2019s reports that the UK PM will announce the UK will leave the single market has disappointed those hoping for a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019. Two delegates arriving at the swanky Steigenberger Grandhotel Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re for breakfast meetings captured the mood. Delegate 1: How are you today? Delegate 2: Oh, I\u2019m very calm D1: Why are you calm? D2: Because the world is coming to an end today. D1: Ah yes, it is today with Theresa Maybe\u2019s speech.... It\u2019s a chilly minus 13 degrees Celsius in Davos this morning, and some of the pavements are a little treacherous, but at least it\u2019s not snowing. Here\u2019s Facebook\u2019s WEF HQ - which the Daily Mail says was built specially for the occasion. Good morning from Davos, where the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Once again world leaders, top business people, economists, academics and the media have descended on this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world and hammer out deals. Much is the same as usual - from the bustling high-powered CEOs to the armed police on the streets. But this year\u2019s WEF is different; taking place under the twin shadows of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and the Brexit vote, and the broader tide of populism. Last night, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told the assembled throng that they must \u201cprioritise\u201d the public social good, over their own interests. \u201cSometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. But we have to look in a confident way into the future.\u201d This morning we\u2019ll get an insight into the new world order, when Chinese president Xi Jinping formally opens WEF. Xi is expected to make a powerful defence of globalisation, and pitch China as a country that could fill the void if Trump tries to take America way from free trade. Quartz has a good take this morning: Xi will defend trade and make a pitch for China to step into the leadership void left by a more-protectionist US under president Trump. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on @realDonaldTrump, to see if the US president-elect tries to steal the Chinese president\u2019s thunder with a trademark early-morning tweetstorm. One of Trump\u2019s key advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, is also taking the stage today to discuss where the US economy is heading. That could give some crucial insights into the Trump camp\u2019s thinking. There\u2019s also masses of other meetings, covering issues such as the 4th Industrial Revolution, equality and climate change, a speech by outgoing secretary of state John Kerry, and Hollywood star Matt Damon with his water.org charity. 11am Davos time/10am GMT: Xi Jinping speech 1pm/noon GMT: Anthony Scaramucci on the Outlook for the United States 3.15pm/2.15pm GMT: John Kerry on \u2018diplomacy in an era of disruption\u2019. We\u2019ll be tracking all the key events in Davos today, and trying to explain what it means for the world economy.",

It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-17T13:35:57.967Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-587e0aafe4b00b8fc2ae15c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-17T12:51:48.996Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci is speaking again \u2013 and insisting that the next US government doesn\u2019t want a trade war either.</strong></p> <p>Scaramucci says the president-elect wants a very strong relationship with China:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MiriamElder/status/821327428257804288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scaramucci on China \u2014\u00a0\u201cThe new administration does not want to have a trade war.\u201d</p>&mdash; Miriam Elder (@MiriamElder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiriamElder/status/821327428257804288\">January 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MiriamElder/status/821328119781031936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scaramucci \u2014\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump could be one of the last great hopes for globalism.\u201d<br><br>0_o</p>&mdash; Miriam Elder (@MiriamElder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiriamElder/status/821328119781031936\">January 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Scaramucci also</strong><strong> talking in desperately glowing terms about how</strong><strong> Donald Trump won the US election, and why he joined the Trump campaign.</strong></p> <p>Scaramucci says he realised that Trump was on to something after he met with visitors to a rally.

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce: questions remain despite \u00a3671m bribery settlement | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For Rolls-Royce, the company, the book is now almost closed. It has apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d in court for the bribery and corruption in its midst in the period 1989 to 2013. It will pay \u00a3671m in penalties, the lion\u2019s share in the UK. It has changed its senior management. And, under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Serious Fraud Office, it will improve its behaviour on pain of getting properly whacked. But the affair cannot be left to lie there. Read the statement of facts in the case, and consider the words of Sir Brian Leveson in the high court as he approved the DPA, to appreciate the size of this scandal. Rolls-Royce\u2019s internal investigation, we learn, involved disciplinary proceedings against 38 individuals in its civil aerospace, energy and marine divisions, leading to 11 employees leaving the company during the disciplinary process and six being dismissed. Others have suffered sanctions short of dismissal. That is a sizeable tally but naturally understates matters since disciplinary proceedings could only be taken against those still on the company\u2019s payroll in 2013 and afterwards. The corruption spanned three decades, remember. And look at Rolls-Royce\u2019s review of the intermediaries it used to win contracts in foreign markets. The company examined 250 relationships and suspended 88 intermediaries. If that suggests a past culture where corruption was completely out of control, so do the words of the judge in his concluding remarks: \u201cMy reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted.\u201d Leveson nevertheless approved the DPA because he accepted that Rolls-Royce is \u201cno longer the company that once it was\u201d and its new board and executive team has sought \u201cto clear out all the disreputable practices\u201d. That seems pragmatic and correct: there is no point in destroying Rolls-Royce, damaging its suppliers and undermining the UK\u2019s defence capabilities. But two questions still loom large: who, at the top at Rolls-Royce, knew what was going on and when? Tuesday\u2019s documents contained no names but, again, the judge\u2019s remarks were powerful. He referred to \u201cmost serious breaches\u201d of the criminal law \u201csome of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. Note, too, the detail that the company, after starting its own investigations in 2013, supplied the SFO with \u201ca report concerning conduct Rolls-Royce had known about since 2010 and previously (under different leadership) decided not to notify\u201d. Until the controlling minds at Rolls-Royce in the relevant period explain their conduct, consider this tale incomplete. A company regarded as the UK\u2019s finest has been disgraced. Now we need to know who let it happen. BAT\u2019s Reynolds takeover shows Big Tobacco is far from burnt out It\u2019s amazing now to recall that when British American Tobacco sold its US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson to RJ Reynolds in 2004, taking a 42% stake in exchange, the deal was worth only $3bn (\u00a32.42bn at current rates). Wind forward to the present day and the numbers have become extraordinary. BAT is now buying the remaining 58% of the restyled Reynolds American, owner of Camel and Newport, for almost $50bn. One must adjust for the $4.7bn BAT injected to maintain its 42% holding after Reynolds\u2019 takeover of Lorillard, another US fags firm, in 2015. Even so, the inflation in valuations shows what a wonderful investment Big Tobacco became once the threat of ruinous class-action litigation was removed. That era began with a grand settlement with 46 US states in 1998 and was later cemented by various rulings that limited punitive damages. The share prices tell the story. Back in 2004, Reynolds\u2019 shares traded around the $8 mark, versus a valuation of $59.64 in Tuesday\u2019s deal. BAT\u2019s shares, in the same period, have improved from \u00a39 to \u00a346 with barely a wheeze along the way. There is cash \u2013 and plenty of it \u2013 in selling to customers who tend to remain loyal until they kick the habit or die. And, in the age of low interest rates, there have been easy opportunities to spice up returns to shareholders via the use of debt. Is there any mileage left, though? BAT is betting there is because it is buying Reynolds at almost 17 times its earnings, thought to be the highest price ever paid for a large tobacco firm. That ratio looks aggressive, especially as promised cost savings of $400m are small in the context of the deal. But BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante could probably justify the punt on four grounds. First, the effective oligopoly in the US market means cigarette prices can continue to be increased gently. Second, there\u2019s a chance Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes, which would do wonders for Reynolds\u2019 bottom-line earnings. Third, the cigarette giants are well on the way to controlling the vaping market (which \u201csatisfies different consumer moments\u201d, in BAT\u2019s grim language), so the threat of major upheaval in earnings is slight. Fourth, it\u2019s hard to go too far wrong in cigarettes; it will take five years to achieve returns in the US that beat the cost of capital, thinks BAT, but it can be confident of getting there eventually. In short, this mega-deal suggests Big Tobacco\u2019s winning run can continue for some time yet. It didn\u2019t seem possible in the litigation-heavy fog of 2004; now it seems probable.",

      "body": "<p>For Rolls-Royce, the company, the book is now almost closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/rolls-royce-apologises-bribery-671m-uk-us-brazil\">It has apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d</a> in court for the bribery and corruption in its midst in the period 1989 to 2013. It will pay \u00a3671m in penalties, the lion\u2019s share in the UK. It has changed its senior management. And, under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Serious Fraud Office, it will improve its behaviour on pain of getting properly whacked.</p> <p>But the affair cannot be left to lie there. Read the statement of facts in the case, and consider the words of Sir Brian Leveson in the high court as he approved the DPA, to appreciate the size of this scandal. Rolls-Royce\u2019s internal investigation, we learn, involved disciplinary proceedings against 38 individuals in its civil aerospace, energy and marine divisions, leading to 11 employees leaving the company during the disciplinary process and six being dismissed. Others have suffered sanctions short of dismissal.</p> <p>That is a sizeable tally but naturally understates matters since disciplinary proceedings could only be taken against those still on the company\u2019s payroll in 2013 and afterwards. The corruption spanned three decades, remember. And look at Rolls-Royce\u2019s review of the intermediaries it used to win contracts in foreign markets. The company examined 250 relationships and suspended 88 intermediaries.</p> <p>If that suggests a past culture where corruption was completely out of control, so do the words of the judge in his concluding remarks: \u201cMy reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted.\u201d</p> <p>Leveson nevertheless approved the DPA because he accepted that Rolls-Royce is \u201cno longer the company that once it was\u201d and its new board and executive team has sought \u201cto clear out all the disreputable practices\u201d. That seems pragmatic and correct: there is no point in destroying Rolls-Royce, damaging its suppliers and undermining the UK\u2019s defence capabilities.</p> <p>But two questions still loom large: who, at the top at Rolls-Royce, knew what was going on and when? Tuesday\u2019s documents contained no names but, again, the judge\u2019s remarks were powerful. He referred to \u201cmost serious breaches\u201d of the criminal law \u201csome of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. Note, too, the detail that the company, after starting its own investigations in 2013, supplied the SFO with \u201ca report concerning conduct Rolls-Royce had known about since 2010 and previously (under different leadership) decided not to notify\u201d.</p> <p>Until the controlling minds at Rolls-Royce in the relevant period explain their conduct, consider this tale incomplete. A company regarded as the UK\u2019s finest has been disgraced. Now we need to know who let it happen.</p> <h2>BAT\u2019s Reynolds takeover shows Big Tobacco is far from burnt out</h2> <p>It\u2019s amazing now to recall that when British American Tobacco sold its US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson to RJ Reynolds in 2004, taking a 42% stake in exchange, the deal was worth only $3bn (\u00a32.42bn at current rates). Wind forward to the present day and the numbers have become extraordinary. BAT is now buying the remaining 58% of the restyled Reynolds American, owner of Camel and Newport, for almost $50bn.</p> <p>One must adjust for the $4.7bn BAT injected to maintain its 42% holding after Reynolds\u2019 takeover of Lorillard, another US fags firm, in 2015. Even so, the inflation in valuations shows what a wonderful investment Big Tobacco became once the threat of ruinous class-action litigation was removed. That era began with a grand settlement with 46 US states in 1998 and was later cemented by various rulings that limited punitive damages.</p> <p>The share prices tell the story. Back in 2004, Reynolds\u2019 shares traded around the $8 mark, versus a valuation of $59.64 in Tuesday\u2019s deal. BAT\u2019s shares, in the same period, have improved from \u00a39 to \u00a346 with barely a wheeze along the way. There is cash \u2013 and plenty of it \u2013 in selling to customers who tend to remain loyal until they kick the habit or die. And, in the age of low interest rates, there have been easy opportunities to spice up returns to shareholders via the use of debt.</p> <p>Is there any mileage left, though? BAT is betting there is because it is buying Reynolds at almost 17 times its earnings, thought to be the highest price ever paid for a large tobacco firm. That ratio looks aggressive, especially as promised cost savings of $400m are small in the context of the deal. But BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante could probably justify the punt on four grounds.</p> <p>First, the effective oligopoly in the US market means cigarette prices can continue to be increased gently. Second, there\u2019s a chance Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes, which would do wonders for Reynolds\u2019 bottom-line earnings. Third, the cigarette giants are well on the way to controlling the vaping market (which \u201csatisfies different consumer moments\u201d, in BAT\u2019s grim language), so the threat of major upheaval in earnings is slight. Fourth, it\u2019s hard to go too far wrong in cigarettes; it will take five years to achieve returns in the US that beat the cost of capital, thinks BAT, but it can be confident of getting there eventually.</p> <p>In short, this mega-deal suggests Big Tobacco\u2019s winning run can continue for some time yet. It didn\u2019t seem possible in the litigation-heavy fog of 2004; now it seems probable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pound has clocked up its biggest one-day gain against the dollar since 1998 as traders seized on Theresa May\u2019s pledge that parliament would vote on any Brexit deal and welcomed some clarity on the government\u2019s plans for leaving the EU. The FTSE 100 headed in the other direction, recording its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June. The share index has been boosted for several months by the fall in the pound, which helps exporters and those companies with overseas earnings, and some of that effect was unwound on Tuesday as the pound jumped almost 3%. The UK currency had been under pressure in the days before the prime minister\u2019s key speech, as investors fretted over the prospect of the blow to trade and economic prosperity from a hard Brexit deal that leaves the country outside the European single market. But on the day of the speech the pound was buoyed early on by news of a rise in inflation. Some investors took that as a further sign that the next move in interest rates would be up, which in turn would strengthen the attraction of sterling. Once May took the podium, the pound rallied further against the dollar and the euro as she confirmed the likely deal to leave the EU would mean quitting the single market but that it would be put to a vote in both the upper and lower houses of parliament. \u201cIn laying out the government\u2019s 12 guiding principles for the upcoming negotiations, Mrs May did remove some key question marks about the government\u2019s approach and promised that both houses of parliament would get to vote on any Brexit agreement,\u201d said Stephanie Flanders, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \u201cThis seems to have reassured investors.\u201d The pound is still down about 17% against the dollar since the referendum and economists warned there was scope for it to fall further, given much uncertainty remained around the UK\u2019s likely Brexit deal and the nature of negotiations with the rest of the EU. But on Tuesday it managed to recover some of its recent losses to reach a 10-day high of $1.2398, a rise of 2.9% on the day. It had dipped below $1.20 on Monday on hard Brexit worries. The FTSE closed down 1.5% at 7,220.38. Commenting on the jump in the pound, Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at spread-betting firm Spreadex said: \u201cAs some expected, the pound had worked out most of its negative feelings about Theresa May\u2019s Brexit intentions already, leading the currency to piggy-back on the less terrifying aspects of the prime minister\u2019s announcement for some rather impressive gains. \u201cIt shows just how desperate the currency was for clarity that May\u2019s speech, with its firm stance on leaving the single market and vague promises of free trade and some kind of new customs agreement, could inspire such a reaction from sterling despite most of what was said being pound-negative.\u201d Sterling\u2019s gains were also flattered by weakness in the dollar after Donald Trump said the US currency was overvalued. Trump said US companies could not compete with China \u201cbecause our currency is too strong. And it\u2019s killing us\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reported. Richard Falkenhall, senior currency strategist at the Nordic bank SEB said the rally would prove to be temporary. \u201cDespite the threats in today\u2019s speech, the UK\u2019s position in negotiations will be very weak once exit negotiations under the treaty starts. There is only a two-year period and the UK has the most to lose if negotiations fail. The two-year period will create a lot of uncertainty which is likely to harm the British economy and in particular the important British financial industry. \u201cWe view today\u2019s pound rally as temporary and expect sterling to weaken again. We would not be surprised if comments from the EU as well as the UK sound very negative in the initial phases of the negotiations and during the exit process.\u201d Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, also noted that the negotiations were far from guaranteed to succeed. \u201cThe prime minister did make a potentially important commitment to ask both houses of parliament to vote on the final deal, a promise which caused sterling to spike upwards,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do not see this as materially reducing the probability of the UK leaving the EU; it looks unlikely that \u2018remaining\u2019 will be one of the two options that parliament will be able to vote for.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The engineering giant Rolls-Royce has apologised after it was found to have paid bribes including a luxury car and millions of pounds\u2019 worth of cash to middlemen to secure orders in six countries, including Indonesia, Russia and China. Britain\u2019s leading multinational manufacturer made the admissions on Tuesday at the high court in London, a day after it was revealed that it would pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle long-running corruption allegations. In a statement read out in court, the firm said it \u201capologised unreservedly for the conduct which has been uncovered\u201d. The settlement was reached with investigators from three countries \u2013 the UK, US and Brazil \u2013 who five years ago started to scrutinise allegations that the firm had hired middlemen to pay bribes to win contracts. Richard Whittam, a QC for the Serious Fraud Office, detailed the findings of what he said was the \u201clargest individual investigation conducted by the SFO to date\u201d. The agreement between the firm and the SFO \u2013 called a deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 revealed systemic and long-running use of middlemen over three decades. The court heard that: \u2022 In Indonesia, Rolls-Royce gave $2.25m (\u00a31.8m) and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an individual in exchange for a \u201cfavour to Rolls-Royce on a contract\u201d for Trent aero engines to be provided to Garuda Indonesia. Separately Rolls-Royce paid a representative from a rival bidder to deliberately submit an uncompetitive bid on a contract Rolls-Royce successfully secured. \u2022 In Thailand, the firm paid more than $36m between 1991 and 2005 to agents to help it secure three separate contracts to supply Trent aero engines to Thai Airways. \u2022 In India, where the use of agents to secure defence contracts is prohibited, Rolls-Royce disguised its use of middlemen as \u201cgeneral consulting services\u201d. The company also admitted paying to retrieve a leaked list of intermediaries after they were obtained by the Indian tax authorities. \u2022 In Nigeria, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to two contracts for which it was bidding. A middleman hired by the company paid bribes to public officials, although Rolls-Royce later pulled out of both deals, in part due to concerns raised over the fact that it had obtained confidential information from a competitor. \u2022 In China, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to the extension of a \u00a35m cash credit to China Eastern Airlines in exchange of the purchase of engines for aircraft in 2013. Some of the funds paid were intended to be used for employees of CEA to attend a two-week MBA course at Columbia University, including what Whittam described as \u201cfour-star accommodation and lavish extracurricular activities\u201d. \u2022 In Russia, Rolls-Royce won a contract to supply equipment to the state-owned energy company Gazprom by making payments to a senior Gazprom official. Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division of the high court, said the case raised questions about whether it would ever be in the public interest to prosecute a company as big as Rolls-Royce. \u201cMy reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. However, he concluded that despite the scale of the crime, it was still appropriate to allow the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and approved it. Robert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International, said the SFO had presented \u201ca poor case\u201d for the DPA, saying: \u201cThis gives the impression that Rolls-Royce is too big to prosecute.\u201d He said: \u201cThere was talk about pensioners and employees, but no mention of the victims of corruption. The poor case could have been offset by details about the prosecution of individuals, but there was nothing about that. If these are not the circumstances for a prosecution, then what are?\u201d More than 30m documents relating to middlemen were examined by 70 investigators during the SFO\u2019s \u00a313m inquiry, and more than 200 interviews of current and former Rolls-Royce employees were carried out. Arrests and searches were made both in the UK and overseas. \u201cIt has been a huge task,\u201d said Whittam. The high court was told negotiations between the firm and investigators had been \u201cconcertinaed\u201d to complete an agreement with US regulators before Donald Trump becomes president on Friday. The settlement means the engineering giant will avoid being prosecuted by anti-corruption investigators in the US, the UK, or Brazil, although individual executives may still be charged. Under the terms, Rolls-Royce will agree to admit wrongdoing, pay the fine and submit to other measures to monitor its conduct over a specific period. If it does not break the agreement, it will not be prosecuted at the end of the agreed period. Leveson said: \u201cIt is important nobody thinks that in financial terms the company is being treated dramatically differently \u2026 to the way in which it would have been dealt with had it gone to court. The big difference is the extent of the cooperation.\u201d In agreements announced on Monday, Rolls-Royce said it would pay \u00a3497m to the SFO. It will also pay $169m in penalties to the US Department of Justice and $25m to the Brazilian authorities. The anti-bribery investigations have undermined the reputation of the multinational, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft around the globe. The car company of the same name is a separate firm. Warren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said: \u201cThe behaviour uncovered in the course of the investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and other authorities is completely unacceptable and we apologise unreservedly for it. This was unworthy of everything which Rolls-Royce stands for, and that our people, customers, investors and partners rightly expect from us. \u201cThe past practices that have been uncovered do not reflect the manner in which Rolls-Royce does business today. We now conduct ourselves in a fundamentally different way. We have zero tolerance of business misconduct of any sort.\u201d Shares in Rolls-Royce jumped 6% on Tuesday after news of the settlement broke. Last year an investigation by the Guardian and the BBC reported that Rolls-Royce had hired \u201ccommercial agents\u201d or advisers to help it secure high-value contracts in at least 12 countries.",

      "body": "<p>The engineering giant Rolls-Royce has apologised after it was found to have paid bribes including a luxury car and millions of pounds\u2019 worth of cash to middlemen to secure orders in six countries, including Indonesia, Russia and China. <br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s leading multinational manufacturer made the admissions on Tuesday at the high court in London, a day after it was revealed that it would pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle long-running corruption allegations. In a statement read out in court, the firm said it \u201capologised unreservedly for the conduct which has been uncovered\u201d.</p> <p>The settlement was reached with investigators from three countries \u2013 the UK, US and Brazil \u2013 who five years ago started to scrutinise allegations that the firm had hired middlemen to pay bribes to win contracts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/rolls-royce-bribery-settlement\">Rolls-Royce: questions remain despite \u00a3671m bribery settlement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Whittam, a QC for the Serious Fraud Office, detailed the findings of what he said was the \u201clargest individual investigation conducted by the SFO to date\u201d. </p> <p>The agreement between the firm and the SFO \u2013 called a deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 revealed systemic and long-running use of middlemen over three decades. The court heard that:</p> <p>\u2022 In Indonesia, Rolls-Royce gave $2.25m (\u00a31.8m) and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an individual in exchange for a \u201cfavour to Rolls-Royce on a contract\u201d for Trent aero engines to be provided to Garuda Indonesia. Separately Rolls-Royce paid a representative from a rival bidder to deliberately submit an uncompetitive bid on a contract Rolls-Royce successfully secured.<br></p> <p>\u2022 In Thailand, the firm paid more than $36m between 1991 and 2005 to agents to help it secure three separate contracts to supply Trent aero engines to Thai Airways.<br></p> <p>\u2022 In India, where the use of agents to secure defence contracts is prohibited, Rolls-Royce disguised its use of middlemen as \u201cgeneral consulting services\u201d. The company also admitted paying to retrieve a leaked list of intermediaries after they were obtained by the Indian tax authorities. <br></p> <p>\u2022 In Nigeria, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to two contracts for which it was bidding. A middleman hired by the company paid bribes to public officials, although Rolls-Royce later pulled out of both deals, in part due to concerns raised over the fact that it had obtained confidential information from a competitor.<br></p> <p>\u2022 In China, Rolls-Royce failed to prevent bribery in relation to the extension of a \u00a35m cash credit to China Eastern Airlines in exchange of the purchase of engines for aircraft in 2013. Some of the funds paid were intended to be used for employees of CEA to attend a two-week MBA course at Columbia University, including what Whittam described as \u201cfour-star accommodation and lavish extracurricular activities\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 In Russia, Rolls-Royce won a contract to supply equipment to the state-owned energy company Gazprom by making payments to a senior Gazprom official.</p> <p>Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division of the high court, said the case raised questions about whether it would ever be in the public interest to prosecute a company as big as Rolls-Royce.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy reaction when first considering these papers was that if Rolls-Royce were not to be prosecuted in the context of such egregious criminality over decades, involving countries around the world, making truly vast corrupt payments and, consequentially, even greater profits, then it was difficult to see when any company would be prosecuted,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. </p> <p>However, he concluded that despite the scale of the crime, it was still appropriate to allow the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and approved it.</p> <p>Robert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International, said the SFO had presented \u201ca poor case\u201d for the DPA, saying: \u201cThis gives the impression that Rolls-Royce is too big to prosecute.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThere was talk about pensioners and employees, but no mention of the victims of corruption. The poor case could have been offset by details about the prosecution of individuals, but there was nothing about that. If these are not the circumstances for a prosecution, then what are?\u201d</p> <p>More than 30m documents relating to middlemen were examined by 70 investigators during the SFO\u2019s \u00a313m inquiry, and more than 200 interviews of current and former Rolls-Royce employees were carried out. Arrests and searches were made both in the UK and overseas. \u201cIt has been a huge task,\u201d said Whittam.</p> <p>The high court was told negotiations between the firm and investigators had been \u201cconcertinaed\u201d to complete an agreement with US regulators before Donald Trump becomes president on Friday.</p> <p>The settlement means the engineering giant will avoid being prosecuted by anti-corruption investigators in the US, the UK, or Brazil, although individual executives may still be charged. Under the terms, Rolls-Royce will agree to admit wrongdoing, pay the fine and submit to other measures to monitor its conduct over a specific period. If it does not break the agreement, it will not be prosecuted at the end of the agreed period.</p> <p>Leveson said: \u201cIt is important nobody thinks that in financial terms the company is being treated dramatically differently \u2026 to the way in which it would have been dealt with had it gone to court. The big difference is the extent of the cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>In agreements announced on Monday, Rolls-Royce said it would pay \u00a3497m to the SFO. It will also pay $169m in penalties to the US Department of Justice and $25m to the Brazilian authorities.</p> <p>The anti-bribery investigations have undermined the reputation of the multinational, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft around the globe. The car company of the same name is a separate firm.</p> <p>Warren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said: \u201cThe behaviour uncovered in the course of the investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and other authorities is completely unacceptable and we apologise unreservedly for it. This was unworthy of everything which Rolls-Royce stands for, and that our people, customers, investors and partners rightly expect from us.</p> <p>\u201cThe past practices that have been uncovered do not reflect the manner in which Rolls-Royce does business today. We now conduct ourselves in a fundamentally different way. We have zero tolerance of business misconduct of any sort.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Rolls-Royce jumped 6% on Tuesday after news of the settlement broke. </p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/rolls-royce-middlemen-may-have-used-bribes-to-land-major-contracts\">an investigation by the Guardian and the BBC</a> reported that Rolls-Royce had hired \u201ccommercial agents\u201d or advisers to help it secure high-value contracts in at least 12 countries. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Teresa May\u2019s hopes of striking a trade deal with the incoming Donald Trump administration have been given a boost after a leading adviser to the president-elect said a new accord could be achieved within six to 12 months. Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier and member of Trump\u2019s transition team, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Barack Obama\u2019s successor would seek a swift and mutually beneficial agreement. Interviewed by ITV News, Scaramucci \u2013 who has sold his hedge fund so that he can take up a job in the White House \u2013 said the US would be hoping to finalise talks within the \u201cfirst six months or the first year of the administration\u201d. Scaramucci said Trump took a different view to a trade deal with Britain to Obama, who said during the EU referendum campaign last year that the UK would go to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d. No single country takes a bigger share of UK exports than the US, and Scaramucci said Trump would \u201ctake the steps necessary to make sure the UK is at the front of the line as opposed to the back of the line, on trade deals\u201d. Later, at a briefing with journalists following May\u2019s Brexit speech, Scaramucci said he was convinced the UK would flourish outside the EU. \u201cThere are two countries I would not bet against \u2013 the US and the UK,\u201d Trump\u2019s aide said. He added that London had been Europe\u2019s financial capital for 500 years before the creation of the EU and would continue in that role post-Brexit. \u201cAfter the referendum I had conversations with customers who said it was going to be a disaster for Britain and the stock market would crash,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cWe know now that the opposite has happened.\u201d Trump\u2019s weekend observations about the probability of other countries following Britain and leaving the EU were badly received in Brussels and other European capitals. Scaramucci said the president-elect was making a political observation about the remoteness of policymaking in Europe in the context of the Brexit vote. \u201cThere is a large group of disenchanted people in pluralistic democracies who feel like they have been left out,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why the EU was created. It has been a success because it has kept the peace. But you have a group of people, legislators and bureaucrats, making decisions that have an impact on Manchester, Milan or Rome and they may not understand the local markets they are making decisions for.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has said that Britain will leave the single market as part of its exit from the European Union but that the country would push for the \u201cgreatest possible\u201d access to tariff-free trade with Europe as part of a deal. The comments from the prime minister \u2013 who also said there would be a phased implementation of the new agreement between Britain and Europe \u2013 bring clarity about the shape of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union but will also spark fresh concerns. This is how the major business representatives have reacted. CBI Britain\u2019s largest business group, which supported the country remaining in the European Union, said Theresa May\u2019s speech had \u201cchanged the landscape\u201d. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said: \u201cRuling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a barrier-free trading relationship between the UK and the EU. But businesses will welcome the greater clarity and the ambition to create a more prosperous, open and global Britain, with the freest possible trade between the UK and the EU. \u201cThe pressure is now on to deliver these objectives and achieve a smooth and orderly exit. Businesses want to make a success of Brexit but will be concerned about falling back on damaging WTO rules.\u201d British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, warned that what \u201creally matters\u201d to businesses is what May secures from the negotiations with the EU, not what she bids for. He said: \u201cWhile businesses now have a clearer sense of the prime minister\u2019s top-line priorities, they will come away from her speech knowing little more about the likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations than they did yesterday. The simple fact is that businesses all across the UK are carrying on. Directly affected companies are being pragmatic, and are preparing for a range of possible outcomes.\u201d Marshall said it was vital that Brexit \u201cmust not become all-consuming\u201d and urged the government to focus on \u201chaving the right skills, infrastructure and business environment across the UK\u201d. Chartered Management Institute The prime minister\u2019s speech makes it \u201cinevitable\u201d that the number of foreign workers coming to the UK will fall, according to Ann Francke, the chief executive of the CMI. She said: \u201cWith the prime minister signalling today that the UK will make a clean break from the EU, it is inevitable that the number of foreign workers coming to the UK will fall after Brexit, so we need to invest heavily in homegrown talent now to ensure that we have the skilled workers capable of plugging the gaps.\u201d Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors The housing shortage in Britain could worsen without access to workers in Europe, RICS warned. Jeremy Blackburn, head of policy at RICS, said: \u201cWhile this clarity is undoubtedly welcome, one thing is clear, a loss of access to the EU\u2019s skilled workforce has the potential to slowly bring the UK\u2019s property and construction sector to a standstill. That means unless alternative plans are put in place, we won\u2019t be able to deliver the thousands of homes needed to solve our housing crisis or create the infrastructure needed to enable our cities to compete on a global stage. Potentially, an embarrassing situation for a government set to publish both its housing white paper and industrial strategy.\u201d CIPD The professional body which represents human resources and people development welcomed the pledges to protect existing employment legislation, but expressed its disappointment that there was no confirmation that EU nationals already residing in the UK will be allowed to stay. Peter Cheese, the chief executive of the CIPD, said: \u201cThe prime minister has made it clear that she wants the UK to be able to control its borders. However, it should still be possible to design a flexible, managed immigration system that allows businesses to access the skilled and unskilled labour they need from both EU and non-EU countries. If we are to use Brexit to deliver a global Britain as the prime minister wishes, then British business must be able to continue to attract and access global talent. \u201cIt is particularly welcome that the prime minister confirmed that the protections afforded to workers through current employment legislation will continue. Many EU-derived regulations provide vital workplace protections and workers up and down the country will be reassured by the news that their rights will not be sacrificed as part of any deal. However, it is disappointing that the prime minister is currently unable to confirm that EU nationals already residing in the UK will be allowed to stay. This needs to be an immediate priority in the negotiations to come.\u201d Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders Car manufacturers believe that May\u2019s comments about the importance of single market arrangements for the industry is \u201ccritical\u201d. Carmakers have previously warned they could pull operations out of Britain without a free-trade arrangement with the rest of Europe, although Nissan last year pledged to expand its operations in Sunderland. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u201cWe need government to deliver a deal which includes participation in the customs union to help safeguard EU trade, trade that is tariff-free and avoids the non-tariff and regulatory barriers that would jeopardise investment, growth and consumer choice. Achieving this will not be easy and we must, at all costs, avoid a cliff-edge and reversion to WTO tariffs, which would threaten the viability of the industry.\u201d BBA The banking industry welcomed the \u201cimportant clarity\u201d and \u201ccommitment to free trade\u201d in May\u2019s speech. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the BBA, said: \u201cThe prime minister has provided important clarity today on the kind of relationship the UK will seek with the EU and we welcome the government\u2019s commitment to free trade with the EU and the rest of the world. \u201cAll existing EU member states have a mutual interest in ensuring that there\u2019s a smooth exit. The government\u2019s support for interim arrangements is essential to ensure there are no cliff-edge effects when the UK leaves the EU. \u201cWe will continue to work with government and regulators to support its negotiation strategy to agree a new partnership with the EU.\u201d TheCityUK The trade body for Britain\u2019s financial services industry praised the prime minister for highlighting the need for a \u201cbespoke agreement\u201d between Britain and the EU. In comments that could soothe fears that financial services firms will leave the City of London, Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: \u201cThere is no existing off-the-shelf solution which can deliver the right deal for the UK, the EU and the global economy. The UK-based financial and related professional services industry has consistently called for an ambitious deal with mutual market access between the UK and the EU on terms similar to those currently in place. The prime minister\u2019s intention to see that the UK gets the highest possible access to EU markets supports this objective. \u201cThe prime minister recognised the important role the UK plays as Europe\u2019s financial centre. Her assertion that the industry must be able to provide its services cross-border post-Brexit will benefit firms and customers in the UK and the EU. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s commitment to ensuring the UK will be able to continue to attract the best domestic, EU and global talent is welcome. Global businesses must be able to continue to move their staff or operations into the UK to ensure it maintains its global attractiveness into the future.\u201d NFU Farmers still have \u201clegitimate and important concerns\u201d about Brexit despite May bringing some much-needed clarity about the negotiations with the EU, the NFU has warned. The agriculture industry exports 72% of its products to the EU, with \u00a3290m out of the \u00a3300m annual lamb exports being sold to Europe. The NFU, which is seeking urgent talks with the government, said it was vital that Britain has the best possible access to trade with Europe and access to a \u201ccompetent and reliable workforce\u201d. It also wants the government to confirm that it sees agriculture as a key industry and ensure that there is a period of transition if there are changes to the trading relationship. The NFU added: \u201cThe prime minister has ruled out the UK\u2019s continuing participation in the European single market or the EU customs union and instead has stated her intention to pursue a free trade agreement with the EU. We hope the prime minister\u2019s ambition can be achieved, but as we know these kind of deals normally take years to conclude and do not cover all products.\u201d Federation of Small Businesses Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said small businesses wanted a \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d free trade agreement with the EU and that it was vital the prime minister met her pledge to have a period of transition to the new arrangement, thereby avoiding a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d. He said: \u201cOne in five FSB members export. This could be doubled with the right tailored small business support from the Department for International Trade along with new free trade agreements with the fastest growing markets in the world. Global trade will only flourish if the free trade agreements prevent additional barriers, such as cost and paperwork. \u201cSmall employers will welcome the pledge to maintain the UK as a true magnet for international talent. We have pressed the government hard to guarantee the right to remain for non-UK EU nationals in existing workforces, and no early cut-off date. Any future system must help small firms to easily recruit the right person, for the right job, at the right time.\u201d Institute of Directors Some business leaders will \u201cregret\u201d the prime minister\u2019s pledge to leave the single market, according to the Institute of Directors, which welcomed the \u201clevel of detail\u201d provided in May\u2019s speech. Allie Renison, the head of Europe and trade policy at the IoD, said: \u201cWhatever the shape of the final trade deal, a smooth and orderly departure is in the whole country\u2019s interests, so businesses will support the commitment to a phased process of implementation. While we do not expect a running commentary, firms hope to get periodic updates to maintain confidence as we make our way towards the exit. \u201cWe now know that we will be leaving the single market, and while there will be firms who regret this, they will at least be able to plan on that basis. Business leaders will be heartened by the prime minister\u2019s strong argument for the value of free trade, an argument currently being made by all too few global leaders. \u201cWe would urge the EU to match the government\u2019s approach in taking a long-term, big-picture view about the need for cooperation and partnership in future.\u201d British Retail Consortium May must ensure that a new deal with the EU does not lead to higher shop prices for consumers, according to leading retailers. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cThe prime minister has an ambitious plan with the right priorities. It is crucial that Britain gets a new deal that works for ordinary British consumers, which doesn\u2019t hit them with the costs of new import tariffs at a time when the pound is already weakened. The government has an opportunity to secure a win-win deal that works for the UK economy, by keeping prices down for consumers while allowing the EU to continue benefiting from its open-trade relationship with the UK.\u201d TUC Trade unions echoed the warning from retailers that consumers must not foot the bill for Britain leaving the single market. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cWorking people are worried they will end up paying the price of leaving the single market. There is real concern that it will be bad for jobs, bad for rights at work, and bad for the living standards of British people. \u201cThe commitment to protect workers\u2019 existing rights and to build on them is welcome. The best way to do this is for the prime minister to agree that UK workers\u2019 rights will always be as good as, or better, than workers\u2019 rights in the rest of the EU.\u201d Business for Scotland The government\u2019s economic strategy is being driven by \u201cold fashioned, isolationist, British nationalism\u201d and May\u2019s negotiating tactics for Brexit \u201camount to nothing more than sticking her fingers in her ears and humming Rule Britannia\u201d, according to Business for Scotland. Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp, the chief executive of Business for Scotland, said: \u201cScotland now has a choice between being dragged under with an isolationist, self destructing, distant, disinterested and dysfunctional UK government or planning a route to greater shared prosperity with a fully empowered, independent Scottish government focused on an international, inclusive, civic national identity and economy policy. A second independence referendum is now inevitable and most likely will take place in May 2018.\u201d JCB Lord Bamford, the chairman of JCB and a supporter of Brexit, said: \u201cI am very encouraged by the vision set out by the prime minister today. The UK voted to leave the EU and she is determined to make this happen in a way that restores our sovereignty but which ensures the UK becomes a global leader in free trade. \u201cBritish business now needs to get behind the government as it sets out to secure the best deal for our country\u2019s future. As the prime minister said, we are leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe \u2013 it will remain an important market for British business but we need to be able to trade freely with the rest of the world as well.\u201d",

We hope the prime minister\u2019s ambition can be achieved, but as we know these kind of deals normally take years to conclude and do not cover all products.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Federation of Small Businesses</strong></h2> <p>Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said small businesses wanted a \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d free trade agreement with the EU and that it was vital the prime minister met her pledge to have a period of transition to the new arrangement, thereby avoiding a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cOne in five FSB members export. This could be doubled with the right tailored small business support from the Department for International Trade along with new free trade agreements with the fastest growing markets in the world. Global trade will only flourish if the free trade agreements prevent additional barriers, such as cost and paperwork. </p> <p>\u201cSmall employers will welcome the pledge to maintain the UK as a true magnet for international talent. We have pressed the government hard to guarantee the right to remain for non-UK EU nationals in existing workforces, and no early cut-off date. Any future system must help small firms to easily recruit the right person, for the right job, at the right time.\u201d<strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>Institute of Directors</strong></h2> <p>Some business leaders will \u201cregret\u201d the prime minister\u2019s pledge to leave the single market, according to the Institute of Directors, which welcomed the \u201clevel of detail\u201d provided in May\u2019s speech.</p> <p>Allie Renison, the head of Europe and trade policy at the IoD, said: \u201cWhatever the shape of the final trade deal, a smooth and orderly departure is in the whole country\u2019s interests, so businesses will support the commitment to a phased process of implementation. While we do not expect a running commentary, firms hope to get periodic updates to maintain confidence as we make our way towards the exit.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know that we will be leaving the single market, and while there will be firms who regret this, they will at least be able to plan on that basis. Business leaders will be heartened by the prime minister\u2019s strong argument for the value of free trade, an argument currently being made by all too few global leaders. </p> <p>\u201cWe would urge the EU to match the government\u2019s approach in taking a long-term, big-picture view about the need for cooperation and partnership in future.\u201d<br></p> <h2>British Retail Consortium</h2> <p>May must ensure that a new deal with the EU does not lead to higher shop prices for consumers, according to leading retailers.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cThe prime minister has an ambitious plan with the right priorities. It is crucial that Britain gets a new deal that works for ordinary British consumers, which doesn\u2019t hit them with the costs of new import tariffs at a time when the pound is already weakened. The government has an opportunity to secure a win-win deal that works for the UK economy, by keeping prices down for consumers while allowing the EU to continue benefiting from its open-trade relationship with the UK.\u201d</p> <h2>TUC</h2> <p>Trade unions echoed the warning from retailers that consumers must not foot the bill for Britain leaving the single market. </p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cWorking people are worried they will end up paying the price of leaving the single market. There is real concern that it will be bad for jobs, bad for rights at work, and bad for the living standards of British people.</p> <p>\u201cThe commitment to protect workers\u2019 existing rights and to build on them is welcome. The best way to do this is for the prime minister to agree that UK workers\u2019 rights will always be as good as, or better, than workers\u2019 rights in the rest of the EU.\u201d</p> <h2>Business for Scotland</h2> <p>The government\u2019s economic strategy is being driven by \u201cold fashioned, isolationist, British nationalism\u201d and May\u2019s negotiating tactics for Brexit \u201camount to nothing more than sticking her fingers in her ears and humming Rule Britannia\u201d, according to Business for Scotland.<br></p> <p>Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp, the chief executive of Business for Scotland, said: \u201cScotland now has a choice between being dragged under with an isolationist, self destructing, distant, disinterested and dysfunctional UK government or planning a route to greater shared prosperity with a fully empowered, independent Scottish government focused on an international, inclusive, civic national identity and economy policy. A second independence referendum is now inevitable and most likely will take place in May 2018.\u201d</p> <h2>JCB</h2> <p>Lord Bamford, the chairman of JCB and a supporter of Brexit, said: \u201cI am very encouraged by the vision set out by the prime minister today. The UK voted to leave the EU and she is determined to make this happen in a way that restores our sovereignty but which ensures the UK becomes a global leader in free trade. </p> <p>\u201cBritish business now needs to get behind the government as it sets out to secure the best deal for our country\u2019s future. As the prime minister said, we are leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe \u2013 it will remain an important market for British business but we need to be able to trade freely with the rest of the world as well.\u201d</p> <h2><br></h2>",

Traders and bankers can now order Greggs pasties and steak bakes to their desks as the bakery chain trials a new service for London\u2019s financial district. Greggs is hoping to be the caterer of choice for office meetings and parties in the capital, offering a range of sweet and savoury products with a minimum spend of \u00a320. The company will deliver within 0.4 miles of its branches on Cheapside and Eastcheap in the City of London, with other locations planned later in the year. The delivery service is already being trialled in Newcastle, with Manchester also in its sights. Roger Whiteside, the Greggs chief executive, said the company was \u201clate to the party\u201d on deliveries and was also developing plans to offer a click-and-collect service. It comes as the high street chain said like-for-like sales, excluding those at shops open for less than a year, rose by 4.2% in 2016. Total sales were up 7%. Trading was was particularly strong over Christmas, with shoppers treating themselves to festive bakes and mince pies. The main driver of sales was Greggs\u2019 \u201cfood on the go\u201d range, with popular items including its Balanced Choice bakes, with fewer than 400 calories, along with hot food options such as burritos. The company said full-year results for 2016 would be better than expected following a positive fourth quarter, but warned of greater uncertainty in the year ahead as consumer budgets come under pressure and business costs rise. Whiteside said: \u201cWe finished 2016 well, delivering our 13th consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth, and anticipate that we will report full-year results for 2016 slightly ahead of our previous expectations. \u201cLooking forward there is greater uncertainty in the trading environment with increased pressure on real income growth. We also continue to expect some industry-wide cost pressures in 2017 and these are likely to have a modest impact on margins in the short term.\u201d He said the business needed to be \u201cmindful\u201d of the financial pressures facing consumers in 2017, as disposable incomes become squeezed by higher inflation. Whitesaid said that the rising cost of ingredients, the living wage, and the apprenticeship levy were all factors driving up business costs. Following the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, food manufacturers are facing higher costs for ingredients imported from abroad and for those priced in dollars. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to mitigate these and we have significant levers to pull. We\u2019re investing in the supply chain and stores which will drive productivity higher. We\u2019re still in growth mode,\u201d he said. As well as opening 66 net new stores in 2016, Greggs converted 208 shops to its \u201cbakery food on-the-go format\u201d, with seating and wifi. \u201cWe\u2019ve been busy transforming the business from a traditional bakery business to a modern food on the go brand,\u201d Whiteside said. Greggs now has more than 1,700 shops. Tom Berry, analyst at Verdict Retail: \u201cGreggs\u2019s confidence in becoming a more varied and appealing food service provider, increasing its threat on the likes of Pret a Manger and Costa, is highlighted through plans such as broadening its hot drinks offer to options such as vanilla latte and Fairtrade peppermint tea. \u201cMeanwhile, Greggs classics such as the sausage, bean and cheese melt now share shelf space with more innovative and on-trend lines such as Bombay potato bake and burritos, meeting cultural demands for different tastes and flavours.\u201d Greggs shares rose by almost 4% to \u00a310.40.",

      "bodyText": "Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos feels this year. The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together, but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his inauguration in Washington later this week. Donald Trump is dominating proceedings. A survey of business executives conducted by PwC showed that companies are worried by Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande. Trump\u2019s influence can also be felt in other ways.

      "bodyText": "Inflation has jumped to the highest rate for two-and-a-half years, hitting 1.6% as the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the Brexit vote continues to push up costs in the UK. Official figures for December showed air fares, food prices and fuel all helped to drive the rise from 1.2% in November. The December rate, as measured on the consumer prices index (CPI), was the highest since July 2014 and higher than forecasts for 1.4% in a Reuters poll of economists. The increase fanned concerns about a squeeze on living standards this year and economists said inflation would continue to climb much higher, leaving households worse off in real terms. The worries stem from sterling\u2019s drop against other currencies since the vote to leave the EU last summer. A weaker pound has raised the costs of imports such as food and fuel, and businesses are starting to pass that on to consumers. The pound came under more pressure in recent days, dropping below $1.20 at one point, ahead of Theresa May\u2019s speech on the Brexit process. But it recovered markedly after she promised a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal. Conor D\u2019Arcy, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the latest inflation figures showed the ultra-low price rises that consumers have benefitted from in recent years were \u201cwell and truly over\u201d. \u201cIt will be years until we see the overall economic impact of Brexit, but the one dead cert in 2017 is rising inflation fuelled by a sharp fall in the pound. With nominal pay only expected to rise by 2.4% in 2017, the risk is we see a fresh pay squeeze with rising prices eating up all pay growth by the end of the year.\u201d The head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, Mike Prestwood, said that while inflation was higher in December it was still below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. \u201cRising airfares and food prices, along with petrol prices falling less than last December, all helped to push up the rate of inflation. Rising raw material costs also continued to push up the prices of goods leaving factories,\u201d he said. But the bigger-than-expected pick up in prices will make the Bank\u2019s task of setting interest rates tougher as it seeks to strike a balance between keeping inflation under control while providing enough support to jobs and economic growth. \u201cWith CPI inflation now within touching distance of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, there will be mounting speculation that the Bank could raise rates,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, economist at the bank HSBC. \u201cParticularly since today\u2019s release goes beyond just oil: food, clothing, air fares and accommodation inflation all pushed higher too. But as we forecast growth to slow, we expect rates to remain on hold despite higher inflation.\u201d The pound is down 17% against the dollar since the referendum, and the pressure on import costs has already sparked some high profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, such as the row over Marmite last year. Apple said on Tuesday that it was raising prices on its UK app store by almost 25% to reflect sterling\u2019s sharp depreciation. The new prices will roll out over the next week, giving customers a short window to beat the price increase. Underscoring the pressures firms face, ONS figures published alongside the inflation update showed another rise in factory costs. The prices of imported materials and fuels were the largest driver, largely on the back of the pound\u2019s depreciation and a recovery in global oil prices as curde production is cut, statisticians said. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 15.8% in December on a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2011. Factory gate prices rose 2.7%, their fastest annual rise since March 2012. Thanks to those sterling-related cost pressures and higher oil prices, some economists expect inflation to rise to around 3% this year. The Bank has said that rise would make life harder for consumers in 2017, as wages fail to keep pace with price rises, squeezing family budgets against a backdrop of slowing economic growth. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said lower-income families would suffer more. \u201cOne big driver of the increase is the rising cost of the weekly shop, which will have a bigger impact on people who are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the charity. \u201cPeople in the bottom fifth of the income scale typically spend \u00a31 in every \u00a36 on food, compared with \u00a31 in every \u00a312 for the richest fifth.\u201d Businesses are also bracing for tougher conditions. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said there was an \u201cever increasing squeeze on manufacturers from rising input costs\u201d. Its senior economist, George Nikolaidis, said: \u201cAny respite is unlikely during 2017 as increased input costs will continue to bite into profit margins in the year ahead.\u201d With the UK economy largely reliant on consumers to drive growth, the Treasury has sought to highlight its efforts to support household incomes, including a planned increase in the national living wage and a freeze on fuel duty. Commenting on the inflation figures, a spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government is committed to helping hard-working people keep more of what they earn and to supporting households with the cost of living.\u201d The TUC said people were going into this latest bout of Brexit uncertainty and inflation on a weak footing. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off than they were before the last financial crisis, and now rising prices are hitting their pay packets again,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. 10 things that went up between November and December Cooking oils and fats: up 5.1% (esp margarine) Bread and cereals: up 1.3% Vegetables: up 0.9% (esp cauliflowers ) Air fares: up 48.9%* Soft drinks and mineral water: up 1.4% Furniture and furnishings: up 2.6% Household appliances: up 1.9% (eg cookers, freezers, dishwashers) DIY materials: up 2% (eg tiles, wallpaper, paint) Pets and pet care: up 0.6% House contents insurance: up 1.2% * Air fares typically rise in December but in December 2016 they rose by more than in December 2015 Source: ONS",

      "bodyText": "The NHS winter crisis may be growing but at least Jeremy Hunt can console himself with a reported \u00a314.5 payout. The health secretary helped set up the online education listings business Hotcourses in 1996, and it is reported to have been sold for more than \u00a330m. It will make him the richest member of the cabinet, although Britain\u2019s pales in comparison with the cabinet Donald Trump is amassing, so far worth a collective $4.5bn (\u00a33.7bn). Here are some of the cabinet\u2019s relative paupers. Philip Hammond The former Guardian-reading teenage goth, now chancellor, is thought to be worth upwards of \u00a38m, thanks to Castlemead, a property-development company he helped set up. It started in housing before moving into building for the healthcare sector and consultancy work. He was paid \u00a31.8m in dividends in 2007. Sajid Javid Reports have suggested the communities and local government secretary, and son of an immigrant bus driver, was making up to \u00a33m a year in his previous job as a banker (never confirmed by Javid). He has properties in London reported to be worth upwards of \u00a36m. Amber Rudd Not much about the home secretary\u2019s finances are known (\u201cI think we have to think very carefully about the balance between transparency and privacy,\u201d she said last year when MPs were coming under pressure to publish their tax returns), but before entering parliament and her steep rise through the ranks, Rudd was an investment banker and venture capitalist.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is keeping a close watch on consumer spending amid signs households are dipping into their savings and amassing debts to keep spending in the face of rising inflation. Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said consumer spending had held up since last summer\u2019s vote to leave the EU but he reiterated a warning that living costs were likely to rise on the back of a weak pound and squeeze households\u2019 real incomes. In a speech setting out the tradeoff the Bank faces between keeping inflation in check and supporting growth and jobs, Carney noted signs that consumers continued to power the UK economy. \u201cAt present, households appear to be entirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties. The saving rate has fallen towards its pre-crisis lows, and consumer borrowing has accelerated notably,\u201d Carney said in a speech to the London School of Economics on Monday. But he reiterated the Bank\u2019s fears that this important driver of growth was under threat this year as the pound\u2019s fall since the EU referendum pushes up the cost of imports and that is passed onto consumers as higher prices. Carney pointed to lessons from recent history that such growth tended to be both \u201cslower and less durable\u201d. \u201cThis is because consumption growth eventually outpaces earnings growth, increasing debt and making demand more sensitive to changes in employment and income,\u201d he said. Speaking a day before official figures are expected to show that inflation reached a two-year high in December, Carney noted the Bank\u2019s forecast made in November for higher inflation to weigh on people\u2019s real incomes, slowing consumption growth. He said that how household spending evolves would be an important consideration for policymakers at the Bank over the next year as they weigh up how to set interest rates. His comments about household borrowing come after the latest figures from the Bank showed that unsecured consumer credit, which includes credit cards, car loans and second mortgages, grew at its fastest rate in more than 11 years. Debt charities said the signs of a credit boom that is close to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crash should set alarm bells ringing in Theresa May\u2019s government. Carney did not elaborate on the rise in household borrowing but said the monetary policy committee would continue to monitor the situation. In his speech, he also defended again the Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August to shore up confidence and limit job losses in the wake of the EU referendum in June. The Bank chose to risk allowing inflation to overshoot its 2% target in order to limit the effects to unemployment, he said. Not acting then would have cost an extra quarter of a million jobs, Carney said. \u201cFully offsetting the persistent effects of sterling\u2019s depreciation on inflation would have required exerting further downward pressure on domestic costs. And that would have meant even more lost output and a total disregard for higher unemployment,\u201d he said. Carney did not give a hint of whether interest rates were headed up or down next. Instead he repeated his recent mantra: \u201cMonetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\u201d Before May\u2019s key speech on the Brexit process on Tuesday, Carney sought to strike an upbeat tone concerning the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU. \u201cThe flexibility and dynamism of this economy will help it adjust as its relationship with the EU becomes clearer and new opportunities with the rest of the world open up,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Among the 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists and celebrities attending this year\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos will be a 64-year-old with receding hair and rimless glasses. The academic demeanour of Larry Fink belies his role running BlackRock, an outfit he founded 30 years ago and which has become the biggest fund manager on the planet, overseeing $5.1tn (\u00a34.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers. The sheer size of the operation \u2013 the UK economy is worth \u00a31.8tn \u2013 puts Fink at the helm of an international powerhouse, with tentacles across markets for stocks and bonds around the globe. In the UK alone, BlackRock is usually found among the top three shareholders in FTSE 100 blue-chip companies. Last week it pipped the UK government to become the biggest investor in Lloyds Banking Group. While Fink makes regular appearances at major events such as Davos \u2013 this year he is to opine on the global economy \u2013 BlackRock is not known for its public pronouncements. It does not provide specific detail on its shareholdings in each company or offer opinions on individual investments. However, there are signs that it may be about to become more vocal in public after its UK arm fired off a letter to the boards of the biggest 350 companies listed in London to urge them to rein in executive pay. Signed by Amra Balic, its head of investment stewardship in Europe, the letter says: \u201cWe consider misalignment of pay with performance as an indication of insufficient board oversight, which calls into question the quality of the board. We believe that shareholders should hold directors to a high standard in this regard.\u201d The accompanying document puts board members on notice that they could face protest votes at annual general meetings. Balic had signalled the letter was being prepared last month when she appeared before MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, which is examining corporate governance at a time when Theresa May has put executive excess back on politicians\u2019 agenda. BlackRock should carry clout, not only because of its size but also because 90% of its investments in listed companies are through tracker funds \u2013 positions it cannot sell even if it does not like the management. In the 12 months to the end of June, it voted against 7% of pay-related resolutions, including Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a370m pay deal at WPP and companies where pay deals were voted down such at engineering company Weir Group and the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew. This expertise in index-tracking \u2013 known as passive investment \u2013 helped it win business in 2016, when it attracted $202bn of new funds. BlackRock was launched in 1988 when Fink and seven others set about creating a fund management house that specialised in investing in bonds, with the support of the Blackstone private equity firm. It was part of the US financial firm PNC by 1995 after Fink parted ways with Blackstone\u2019s Steve Schwarzman. BlackRock floated in New York four years later and, apart from taking a dive during the 2008 financial crisis, its share price has been on an upward trajectory ever since. A series of deals followed, notably including with Merrill Lynch over its fund management arm in 2006, and later the acquisition of Barclays\u2019 fund management arm in the depths of the financial crisis. The takeover of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 brought with it iShares, a business that specialises in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track markets. There have been concerns that funds such as these could create systemic risks by accentuating market moves during times of stress. BlackRock is also known for a risk-management system known as Aladdin, used to monitor risks posed by changes to interest rates and other factors that can affect the value of investments. Last year, it came under fire for failing to clamp down on boardroom excess. Steve Silberstein, the founder of computer company Innovate Interfaces, took issue with BlackRock\u2019s voting record in the US and started a petition to urge the company to take a more aggressive approach. His resolution at BlackRock\u2019s annual meeting last year got the support of just 4% of shareholders. In the UK, BlackRock\u2019s rivals wonder whether the $26m paid to Fink last year will stand in the way of its calls on leading companies to rein in excess. Insiders rubbish the idea \u2013 and point out that measuring impact by voting records does not take account of the behind-the-scenes talks with companies to avert showdowns at annual meetings.",

We believe that shareholders should hold directors to a high standard in this regard.\u201d </p> <p>The accompanying document puts board members on notice that they could face protest votes at annual general meetings.</p> <p>Balic had signalled the letter was being prepared last month when she appeared before MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, which is examining corporate governance at a time when Theresa May has put executive excess back on politicians\u2019 agenda.</p> <p>BlackRock should carry clout, not only because of its size but also because 90% of its investments in listed companies are through tracker funds \u2013 positions it cannot sell even if it does not like the management. </p> <p>In the 12 months to the end of June, it voted against 7% of pay-related resolutions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-deal-faces-investor-revolt-at-wpp-agm\">including Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a370m pay deal at WPP</a> and companies where pay deals were voted down such at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/shareholder-rebellions-shire-pay-agm-ceo-investor-anger\">engineering company Weir Group</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew</a>. </p> <p>This expertise in index-tracking \u2013 known as passive investment \u2013 helped it win business in 2016, when it attracted $202bn of new funds. </p> <p>BlackRock was launched in 1988 when Fink and seven others set about creating a fund management house that specialised in investing in bonds, with the support of the Blackstone private equity firm.</p> <p>It was part of the US financial firm PNC by 1995 after Fink parted ways with Blackstone\u2019s Steve Schwarzman. BlackRock floated in New York four years later and, apart from taking a dive during the 2008 financial crisis, its share price has been on an upward trajectory ever since. </p> <p>A series of deals followed, notably including with Merrill Lynch over its fund management arm in 2006, and later the acquisition of Barclays\u2019 fund management arm in the depths of the financial crisis. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/12/blackrock-buys-barclays-fund-unit\">takeover of Barclays Global Investors in 2009</a> brought with it iShares, a business that specialises in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track markets. There have been concerns that funds such as these could create systemic risks by accentuating market moves during times of stress.</p> <p>BlackRock is also known for a risk-management system known as Aladdin, used to monitor risks posed by changes to interest rates and other factors that can affect the value of investments. </p> <p> Last year, it came under fire for failing to clamp down on boardroom excess. Steve Silberstein, the founder of computer company Innovate Interfaces, took issue with BlackRock\u2019s voting record in the US and started a petition to urge the company to take a more aggressive approach. His resolution at BlackRock\u2019s annual meeting last year got the support of just 4% of shareholders. </p> <p>In the UK, BlackRock\u2019s rivals wonder whether the $26m paid to Fink last year will stand in the way of its calls on leading companies to rein in excess. Insiders rubbish the idea \u2013 and point out that measuring impact by voting records does not take account of the behind-the-scenes talks with companies to avert showdowns at annual meetings.</p>",
