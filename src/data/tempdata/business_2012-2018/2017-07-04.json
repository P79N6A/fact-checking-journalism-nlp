      "bodyText": "Seven rail companies, including Virgin Trains\u2019 east and west coast franchises, have agreed to allow passengers to buy cheaper Advance tickets as close as 10 minutes before their journey starts. Following the lead taken by CrossCountry in January 2015 after a successful trial, seven more train companies have dropped punitive restrictions that in the past meant that customers could generally only buy cut-price Advance tickets up to midnight on the day before travel. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents the train operators and Network Rail, said customers of Grand Central, Greater Anglia, Northern, TransPennine Express, Virgin Trains East Coast, Virgin Trains West Coast and those using the Caledonian Sleeper from London to Scotland can now also buy Advance tickets for many trains on the day of travel. Advance tickets \u2013 cut-price fares for a limited number of seats on specific trains \u2013 can be bought as little as 10 minutes before the train departs, helping people who have to make urgent train journeys for business or family reasons. The increased flexibility is the latest action to emerge following the fares and ticketing action plan set up last year by government, industry and passenger groups to try to simplify the UK\u2019s labyrinthine and confusing rail ticketing system. Operators have been criticised for confusing offers and strict adherence to terms and conditions. \u201cNot everyone can plan journeys in advance and now more people can buy cheaper tickets on the day, even on their way to the station,\u201d said Jacqueline Starr, managing director of customer experience at the RDG. \u201cWe want customers to get the best possible deal whenever they travel.\u201d Research by passenger group Transport Focus found that Advance tickets are popular with rail passengers, as they can offer significant savings of up to 70% for those prepared to commit to a particular train. But the vast array of different types of tickets, different names and baffling restrictions are confusing, it warned. Despite the restrictions, sales of popular Advance tickets have increased by almost four-fold over the last ten years. \u201cPassengers will welcome this change as it will provide them with a greater opportunity to have access to cheaper tickets\u201d said Anthony Smith, Transport Focus chief executive. \u201cNo doubt many passengers travelling with these eight train companies will take advantage of this offer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Households should prepare for interest rates to rise as the Bank of England withdraws some of the emergency support it injected into the economy in the wake of last year\u2019s Brexit vote, a top policymaker has warned. Michael Saunders used a Guardian interview to explain why he had voted for a rate rise last month and to emphasise that it was no longer necessary for Threadneedle Street to keep its foot to the floor with record low borrowing costs. The external member of the monetary policy committee (MPC) said the economy had confounded gloomy forecasts made in the aftermath of the referendum and he warned inflation would climb higher and stay well above the Bank\u2019s target for longer without action. \u201cI think households should prepare for interest rates to go higher at some point. But if rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling,\u201d he said. Speaking on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the last time the Bank raised interest rates, Saunders rebuffed suggestions that policymakers should hold fire while Brexit negotiations get underway. \u201cWe are not constrained from adjusting interest rates during the Brexit period. There\u2019s no sense that policy has to stay on hold just because Brexit negotiations are under way,\u201d he said. The Bank slashed interest rates to an all-time low of 0.25% and unveiled a package of measures to shore up the economy in the wake of the Brexit vote. At the time it predicted the economy would grind to a halt by the end of 2016. In the event, resilient consumer spending helped power growth and the UK was one of the best performing advanced economies in the world. Saunders watched that August rate cut from home while on gardening leave. He had left his job at the investment bank Citigroup, where he had been an economist since 1990, after his appointment to the MPC was announced in April 2016. He joined the committee three days after August\u2019s emergency Brexit package was unveiled. In June, he was one of three MPC members voting to raise rates to 0.5%. Against the backdrop of a consumer squeeze and sharp slowdown in growth, they were outvoted by the five other policymakers, including governor Mark Carney. But since then, Carney and the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane have suggested they are more open to higher rates. Saunders hints he will vote again for a rise at the next meeting in August. \u201cAt the moment, in monetary policy terms if you like, our foot is pretty much on the floor with the accelerator. Record low policy rate, large stock of quantitative easing, and I don\u2019t think the economy needs as much stimulus as that,\u201d he said. The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has left the Bank with a tricky balancing act. A weaker pound has made imports more expensive and pushed inflation well above the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target to 2.9% on the latest figures. But household budgets have suffered as wages have failed to keep pace with inflation and consumer spending has slowed, knocking overall GDP growth. Saunders predicts inflation will rise further and the trade-off for the Bank between supporting jobs and growth and keeping inflation in check has shifted. Now there was a risk of acting too late to curb rises in costs. \u201cTo me this is the time when you don\u2019t take the punch bowl away fully but you just start to edge it away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk that you run with maximum stimulus is that the jobless rate keeps falling then at some point if pay growth picks up you have to reverse course very sharply. It would then be much harder for tightening to be limited and gradual. You\u2019d be having to play catch-up.\u201d Saunders says his visits to businesses around the country have highlighted firms\u2019 growing difficulty in hiring staff from overseas. That could well push up wage growth, he feels. \u201cThere has been this extra pool of labour which firms can call on and most of the rise in employment, the overwhelming part of the rise in employment of the last five years has been from people born outside the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from talking to firms that it\u2019s getting harder to persuade people to come to the UK.\u201d Another factor pushing him towards higher rates are signs that exports are \u201cdoing really well\u201d and investment intentions have picked up. \u201cI am reasonably confident that the pick-up in investment and exports will roughly balance the consumer slowdown,\u201d he said. But even if that is enough to convince most of his MPC colleagues to vote for a hike this year, Saunders cautions against over-reacting. \u201cIf rates were to rise to 0.5%, policy would still be pretty loose. We would still be providing plenty of stimulus, continuing to support output and jobs.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HBOS took a \u00a3240m hit in 2007 after discovering a \u201cserious control breakdown\u201d in its Reading operation, according to information published by the City regulator for the first time. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday published information that had been redacted by its predecessor body in a 2012 regulatory notice because of an investigation by Thames Valley police into the HBOS Reading branch. That police investigation, which began in 2010, led to a trial in January after which six individuals were jailed, including former HBOS employee Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses and pleaded guilty. Scourfield referred struggling companies to David Mills and his consultancy QCS. He and Mills were jailed along with four others for their activities between 2003 and 2008. The redacted paragraphs shine a light on what the Financial Services Authority \u2013 the City regulator at the time \u2013 had concluded in 2012, while the police investigation was still going on. The passage said: \u201cA serious control breakdown in corporate\u2019s Reading office was discovered in March 2007. \u201cA senior member of staff had been sanctioning limits and additional facilities beyond the scope of his delegated lending authority undetected for at least three years. \u201cThe additional facilities were provided to distressed companies, and involved the use of a workout firm that had a potentially inappropriate link with the member of staff. This unauthorised extension of credit may have exposed the firm and the firm\u2019s customers to potential fraud.\u201d The regulator said HBOS took a \u00a376m bad debt provision in the first half of 2007 and by the end of the year this had increased to \u00a3240m. The information is contained in a 2012 decision notice by the FSA \u2013 now replaced by the FCA \u2013 which as previously reported found an arm of HBOS had committed \u201cvery serious misconduct\u201d in the run-up to the crisis. The so-called decision notice analyses the Reading operations in the context of the systems and controls in place at the time and does not conclude that fraud took place. After the FCA published the unredacted report, Lloyds Bank, which took over HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis, said \u201conce again we apologise and express our deep regret to customers\u201d. The bank was \u201cdetermined to get to the bottom of what happened at HBOS Reading and to find out who knew what, when\u201d. The publication of the missing six paragraphs comes when the FCA is investigating when HBOS knew about the problems in Reading and while Lloyds is awaiting the outcome of an investigation it has commissioned into how it handled the situation when it took over HBOS.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is stepping up its scrutiny of banks and other lenders on credit cards, personal loans and car purchases amid fears that growing consumer debt could rebound on the banking system. Threadneedle Street is writing to the firms it regulates after reviewing the consumer credit sector, where lending is growing at 10.3% a year \u2013 outpacing the 2.3% rise in household income. The bank is calling on firms to look at the terms under which they are granting 0% balance transfers on credit cards and the basis on which they are issuing personal loans, and to consider the impact of a fall in value of a car when providing vehicle finance. Its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found that while the current pace of growth was not being driven by a relaxation of lending standards, it was concerned that to achieve their future plans they would have to do so. The PRA found \u201cthat the resilience of consumer credit portfolios is reducing, due to the combination of continued growth, lower pricing \u2026 And some increased lending into higher-risk segments\u201d. The statement issued on Tuesday followed the Bank\u2019s announcement last week that lenders would be required to put aside \u00a311.4bn of capital to help prepare for any rise in bad debts from consumer lending. Providing more information on that decision, the Bank said its financial policy committee (FPC), which looks at risks in the financial system, had recently discussed the risk that lenders \u201cmight be placing excessive weight on recent good performance in this sector, given that the current environment was likely to have improved the credit scores of borrowers\u201d. Threadneedle Street said banks were themselves the best way to protect against rising consumer credit. \u201cThe FPC agreed that firms remained the first line of defence against these risks. Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks were priced appropriately and benign conditions did not lead to complacency by lenders.\u201d The Bank asked for a series of information from lenders, including - on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the last interest rate rise, - \u201cwhether today\u2019s \u2018new generation\u2019 of borrowers (without experience of higher interest rates environments) has implications for their credit-scoring models\u201d. Car finance, the fastest growing part of the consumer finance sector, is being driven by personal contract purchase deals which now make up 80% of the market. The Bank said a fall in car prices could lead to a surplus of vehicles coming on to the market which could mean losses for lendersand asked lenders to analyse the impact on capital from each incremental 10% fall in car prices. The Bank\u2019s data showed that in the credit card market, the average term on zero-balance transfers has more than doubled to nearly 30 months, and its latest report was published as TSB cut its rates on loans between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,499 to a market-leading 3.3% APR. The Bank said, though, that the practices the industry followed before the 2008 crisis were no longer being adopted. Credit card write-offs were 6.5% in 2006 and 2007 \u2013 more than double the current rate. The PRA \u2013 which regulates 40% of providers of car finance and 80% of the credit card market \u2013 looks at the consumer finance market from the perspective of the lenders. The impact on borrowers is considered by the Financial Conduct Authority, which is scheduled to provide an update on its views later this month but on Tuesday told firms to scrutinise their bonus schemes. \u201cWe expect firms to understand the effects their staff incentives might be having,\u201d said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA.",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, the controversial billionaire founder of Sports Direct, allegedly secretly paid his former chief executive \u00a31m-a-year out of his personal funds in order to keep down the pay of other staff. Ashley, who was exposed for paying warehouse staff effectively less than the minimum wage, is alleged to have paid former Sports Direct boss Dave Forsey \u00a31m a year on top of his \u201cofficial\u201d \u00a3150,000 salary as \u201ca side payment so as artificially to cap the wages of other staff\u201d. The sportswear tycoon is also alleged to have personally paid Forsey a secret \u00a35m bonus \u2013 on top of a another publicly declared \u00a35m company bonus \u2013 for his role in helping Sports Direct float on the stock market and turn Ashley into a billionaire in 2007. The allegations of secret payments were made by a former banker who is suing Ashley in the high court for allegedly reneging on a \u00a315m payment said to have been agreed over a boozy session in a London pub. Jeff Blue, a former Merrill Lynch banker and former strategic development director at Sports Direct, said in his evidence that the side payments may explain why Forsey appeared happy to work at the company despite officially being one of the lowest-paid bosses of a publicly listed company in the UK. \u201cAccording to Sports Direct\u2019s annual reports, Mr Forsey receives an annual salary of \u00a3150,000 per annum,\u201d Blue said in evidence filed at the high court. \u201cOn that basis, Mr Forsey receives one of the lowest salaries of any chief executive leading a FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 listed company. \u201cHowever \u2026 I was subsequently informed by Peter Cowgill [the boss of JD Sports, Sports Direct\u2019s bitter rival] in separate conversations that Mr Forsey is in fact paid up to \u00a31m per annum directly by Mr Ashley. One benefit of this arrangement is that it imposes an artificial cap on all other salaries paid to employees at Sports Direct.\u201d Blue also alleged that Ashley personally paid each of four Sports Direct senior managers, including Forsey, a \u00a35m bonus for their role in the successful stock market flotation. \u201cSports Direct\u2019s 2008 annual report disclosed that Mr Forsey and Mr [Bob] Mellors each received a \u00a35m bonus in recognition of their contribution to Sport Direct\u2019s listing on the London Stock Exchange in February 2007,\u201d Blue said. \u201cWhat was not disclosed is that, according to Barry Leach and Peter Wood [both Sports Direct directors], Sean Nevitt, Karen Byers [both senior Sports Direct executives] and Justin Barnes [a consultant not permanently employed by Sports Direct] also each received an IPO bonus of \u00a35m from Sports Direct, and that Mr Ashley separately paid a further IPO bonus of \u00a35m (each) to Mr Forsey, Mr Mellors, Mr Nevitt and Ms Byers from his personal funds.\u201d Ashley is due to give evidence on Wednesday. The court case on Tuesday heard that Blue had asked Topshop billionaire Sir Philip Green to intervene on his behalf with Ashley, in an attempt to collect \u00a314m Blue claims he is owed from the deal allegedly agreed in the Horse &amp; Groom pub in Fitzrovia, central London. Green declined to help. \u201cI had been going to extreme lengths to resolve this,\u201d Blue told the court. At one point, after weeks of trying to speak to Ashley, Blue recorded a conversation with the retailer. \u201cI presented him with a letter I wanted him to read, yes I recorded it,\u201d Blue said. The recording was played in court. \u201cI sent you a letter, I\u2019d like you to read it,\u201d Blue said in the recording. \u201cI\u2018ve scan read it,\u201d Ashley replied almost immediately. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street closed for the Independence Day holiday, it looks like a quiet afternoon lies ahead. So here\u2019s a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised the pressure on UK lenders not to offer credit recklessly. The central bank is demanding proof that loans are being made in a sensible fashion, following growing concern that an unsustainable credit bubble is building. The BoE is particularly concerned about the growth in 0% teaser credit card deals, and PCP car loans. Both areas could trigger steep losses for lenders if the economy deteriorates. The latest economic data shows that UK builders expanded at a slower rate in June, after a strong May. Economists say that political uncertainty, due to Brexit and the hung parliament, is putting clients off committing to new projects. The split at the Bank of England over interest rates has widened yet further. Policymaker Ian McCafferty has argued that it would be prudent to raise borrowing costs now, but fellow MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe says it\u2019s much better to wait, given the slowing economy. European Central Bank chief economist Peter Praet has also sounded dovish, saying it\u2019s too early for the ECB to declare victory and start unwinding its stimulus. In the City, shares in payments group Worldpay have surged by 30%, after it received two takeover bids. Europe\u2019s stock markets are in the red, with North Korea\u2019s missile test hitting sentiment. Worldpay, though, has dragged the FTSE 100 back up into the green.... That\u2019s may be all for today, tho we\u2019ll be back if anything dramatic happens.... Just in: The European Union has approved Italy\u2019s bailout of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi. Bloomberg has the details: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena won formal European Union approval to receive a \u20ac5.4bn ($6.1bn) capital injection from the Italian government in return for further restructuring of the world\u2019s oldest bank. The European Commission has approved Italy\u2019s plan to support the bank\u2019s recapitalization under EU rules, \u201con the basis of an effective restructuring plan,\u201d the authority said in a statement, clearing the so-called precautionary recapitalization of a lender that needs state help to survive even though it\u2019s been declared solvent by banking supervisors. \u201cThis will help ensure the bank\u2019s long-term viability, whilst limiting competition distortions.\u201d Over in Rome, the ECB\u2019s chief economist has added his voice to the cacophony of central bank policymakers offering guidance about how, and when, monetary policy might change. Peter Praet\u2019s view is that the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures are bearing fruit; but it\u2019s too early to stop them. He says: As the economic prospects brighten, higher expected returns on business investment will make borrowing conditions increasingly attractive. This, in and of itself, will reinforce accommodation and make sure that inflation sustainably converges towards our objective of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. But our mission is not yet accomplished. We need patience and persistence. We need to be patient, because inflation convergence needs more time to show through convincingly in the data. The euro area\u2019s economic environment is improving, and the fat negative tail to inflation expectations, which was so visible at the start of our asset purchase programme, has virtually disappeared. This strengthens our confidence that headline inflation will gradually move towards the Governing Council\u2019s objective. But measured inflation remains exceedingly volatile and metrics of underlying price pressures continue to be subdued. The entire distribution of inflation expectations still needs to shift a fair distance to the right. And here\u2019s what he means: The ECB is currently holding interest rates at record lows, and buying \u20ac60bn of government and corporate bonds each month with new money. Praet signed off his speech with a strong hint that the ECB should be cautious about unwinding this huge stimulus, despite pressure from hawkish policymakers to rein things in: We need to be persistent, because the baseline scenario for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance. Alarm bells are ringing over in Athens after foreign lenders signalled Greece would not received promised bailout funds before further prior actions \u2013 or reform measures \u2013 are taken. The delay in disbursement has raised anxiety as the country must begin honouring debt repayments from July 17. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Greece\u2019s failure to implement four reforms - one as minor as failing to name the streets where stores can remain open for Sunday trade \u2013 now means that the European Stability Mechanism will put off its decision to disburse further loans to the cash-strapped country until next week. Originally disbursements worth \u20ac7.7bn euro were expected in early July following the euro zone\u2019s decision to throw Greece a new credit line of \u20ac8.5bn last month. Any move by the euro zone\u2019s bailout fund is now not expected until July 13th at the earliest \u2013 just days before debt repayments are due. The debt-stricken state owes over \u20ac7bn euro mostly to the European central Bank with a maturity date of July 17 for private bondholder repayments of \u20ac2bn. The Greek media, citing a European Commission source in Brussels, said the EU was awaiting confirmation from the IMF that the last remaining prior actions had indeed been enforced before the process could be completed. Let\u2019s get back to the slowdown in the UK building sector last month (see 9.36am for the data). Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says political uncertainty hurt the sector: \u201cThis month\u2019s reading may not come as a surprise as the industry has grappled with the outcome of the general election, particularly civil engineering firms dependent on steady pipelines. \u201cThe headwinds prompted by the EU referendum a year ago continue to challenge the sector. Input price inflation is still an issue and there remain concerns about how the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will affect construction firms, given their reliance on European labour. Michael O\u2019Shea, partner and construction specialist at law firm Gowling WLG, agrees that Theresa May\u2019s precarious grip on power is weighing on the sector: \u201cThis data is entirely consistent with conversations we are having with construction companies across the spectrum. While house building continues to grow, there are significant issues around securing labour and the rising cost of materials. \u201cAt this mid-point in the calendar year, construction firms will be taking stock of their order book for 2018. If this isn\u2019t in good shape - especially for those relying on major infrastructure projects - and the forecast looks less than positive, it will dampen confidence. To combat this, the government must take decisive action on such projects, including the nuclear sector. However, with the spectre of another general election still looming, there is an unhelpful amount of uncertainty in the market at present.\u201d Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, fears that builders will struggle to find workers after Brexit: \u201cMigrant workers are the lifeblood of the sector and while the plan to provide more than three million EU citizens permanent residence is a good start, the ongoing movement of labour within the bloc is still a huge issue. Its loss will have a profound impact across the industry\u2019s supply chain and profitability, so it\u2019s unsurprising to see construction businesses urging the government to secure a transition deal with the EU at the very least. Chris Williamson of Markit, which produced the report, flags up that confidence among builders is down -- matching a similar fall among manufacturing bosses yesterday. Takeover fever has hit the City today, as FSTE-100 listed Worldpay revealed it has received two separate approaches. Shares in Worldpay, which is the UK\u2019s largest payments processor, have soared by almost 25%. This has driven its market capitalisation up to \u00a38bn, from \u00a36.4bn last night. Traders scrambled to buy shares after Worldpay revealed that US firm Vantiv, and JP Morgan, had both made approaches. WorldPay was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland following its taxpayer-funded bailout. It offers credit card, online and contactless payment technologies - which are used in small firms around the UK. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover says the Bank of England is turning up the heat on UK lenders today: The Bank of England told U.K. banks to prove that their policies on credit cards, personal loans and other types of consumer lending won\u2019t leave them weaker in a downturn. The BOE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority said on Tuesday that firms need to show that they\u2019re not underestimating the risks of consumer credit given the current \u201cbenign economic environment.\u201d The Financial Times\u2019s Gemma Tetlow argues that the Bank could have gone further.... The Bank of England stopped short of tightening consumer borrowing controls on Tuesday but ordered banks to show they are addressing concerns about the growing riskiness of their lending. Following a review of 20 lenders, the BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has raised concerns that some are being too complacent in their assessment of potential losses in their lending portfolios. Tim Wallace of the Daily Telegraph says lenders will face the consequences if they can\u2019t prove that their lending isn\u2019t too risky: Officials at the Bank are worried that debt is growing at an extraordinary pace, which can only be achieved if lenders are taking more and more risks and giving out loans to households that are less able to afford the burden. Ultra-low interest rates could also have lulled banks into a false sense of security, as customers can afford their debts right now but might get into trouble when rates rise. UK consumers should take heed of the Bank of England\u2019s concerns, says Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk. She predicts that lenders will now tighten their terms, meaning higher costs for borrowers: \u201cThe regulators are worried we won\u2019t be able to repay the money we\u2019ve borrowed because lenders weren\u2019t careful enough about making sure we could afford to pay them back if times get tight. They\u2019re right to be concerned; it\u2019s shocking to think some lenders may have been lax with their affordability assessments, pricing and risk profiling because this could land them and us in hot water if the economy takes a downturn. \u201cIn a worst case scenario this could be the beginning of the end for widespread availability of very cheap loans, long term unsecured lending and lengthy 0% deals. Lenders will be left with little choice but to up their pricing and tighten their lending criteria if they can\u2019t make the numbers add up. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to leave it to lenders to stress test your income though; do it yourself so you\u2019re confident you\u2019re only borrowing money you can afford to repay now and if other bills rise or the amount you\u2019re earning falls in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever you apply for new credit with your eyes open. Make sure your credit report is correct and check your chance of getting accepted before you apply if you can. Go for the cheapest option and borrow the smallest amount you need for the shortest time you can.\u201d There are a few interesting charts in today\u2019s announcement from the Bank of England. This one shows how credit card write-offs are creeping higher, but much lower than after the financial crisis broke. This shows how lenders have been offering 0% teaser rates for longer and longer, to lure customer to transfer their balances. And this one shows the explosive growth in Personal Contract Purchase plans to finance new car deals: My colleague Jill Treanor has emerged from the Bank of England, where selected media have been briefed about the consumer credit move. She writes: The Bank of England is stepping up its scrutiny of banks and other lenders on credit cards, personal loans and car purchases amid fears they are being lulled into a false sense of security by the current economic backdrop. Threadneedle Street is writing to the firms it regulates after reviewing the consumer credit sector, where lending is growing at 10.3% a year \u2013 outpacing the 2.3% rise in household income. The bank is calling on firms to look at the terms under which they are granting zero-balance transfers on credit cards and the basis on which they are issuing personal loans, and to consider the impact of a fall in value of a car when providing vehicle finance. Its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found that while the current pace of growth was not being driven by a relaxation of lending standards, it was concerned that to achieve their future plans they would have to do so... More here: Effectively, the Bank of England is firing a warning shot over the bows of the consumer credit industry today. It is demanding that all firms with \u201cmaterial exposures to consumer credit\u201d provide evidence that they are lending sensible, rather than enforcing tougher rules today. It warns them that: Firms are the first line of defence against the risk of losses on these exposures. The BoE wants to see proof that: Credit-scoring adequately captures medium-term risk, Stress-testing approaches do not under-estimate potential downturn risk, Any \u2018loss leader\u2019 segments are explicitly reported and monitored. Consideration is given to whether, at the cut-off point for new business, a \u2018prudent add-on\u2019 is or should be applied The Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) has been interpreted prudently in underwriting A borrower\u2019s total debt (including secured) is taken into account in the underwriting process, Firms\u2019 risk appetite, MI and governance frameworks are sufficient to oversee consumer credit portfolios, including controls embedded to prevent unintended drift in underwriting, overall asset quality or pricing-for-risk standards, and board oversight of this. Click here to read the full statement from the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. The Bank of England has singled out some key areas of concerns in the credit market. One is credit cards, where some lenders are \u201cbecoming dependent on long-term 0% promotional offers (including balance transfers) to attract new balances\u201d. Those deals are particularly vulnerable to economic changes, the Bank\u2019s PRA says: Where new business on 0% interest credit cards is only marginally profitable, it implies that firms will be facing losses if model assumptions turn out to be optimistic. Another is motor finance, where Personal Contract Purchase deals are increasingly popular. Under those deals, a customer can effectively lease a new car for a few years and then walk away - leaving the lender owning the vehicle. That creates a risk, if the value of the car has depreciated faster than expected. The PRA warns that: PCP creates explicit risk exposure to the vehicle\u2019s residual value for lenders, who typically offer a guaranteed future value (GFV) for the vehicle. Gross GFV exposure is estimated to be around \u00a323 billion across the industry, and GFVs are typically set in the range of 85-95% of the vehicle\u2019s expected future value (with a minority higher than that). PCPs written at the high end of this range are particularly exposed to a significant downturn in the used car market, possibly outside historic experience (used car prices fell by up to c.20% in the crisis, before recovering). An initial fall in prices could lead to a surplus of used cars coming to the market, which could further weaken prices and cause material losses to lenders through their GFV risk Newsflash: The Bank of England has launched its crackdown on risky consumer lending, by ordering British banks and other lenders to prove that they\u2019re not taking too much risk. The BoE\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority is tightening thing up, following concerns that some lenders have been too gung-ho when offering credit to consumers. Lenders have been told to prove, by September, that they are adequately protected against consumer credit risks. But the BoE isn\u2019t actually bringing in any new rules today -- instead, it\u2019s warning companies that they need prove they\u2019re not exposed to too much danger. In a statement, the PRA warned that the consumer credit market appears to have deteriorated, saying: In an environment of rapid growth in consumer credit, interest margins have fallen and there was evidence of weakness in some aspects of underwriting, so lenders are more vulnerable to losses in stress. Overall, the PRA judges that the resilience of consumer credit portfolios is reducing, due to the combination of continued growth, lower pricing, falling average risk-weights (for firms using internal-ratings based models2), and some increased lending into higher-risk segments. More to follow.... Newsflash: Growth in the UK building sector slowed last month. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which has fallen to 54.8 in June, from 56.0 in May. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this signals that the sector cooled a little after a strong performance in May. The building firms surveyed cited \u201crenewed risk aversion among clients\u201d, due to the economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty. Another worrying sign - optimism among construction companies is now the lowest since December 2016. Tim Moore of Markit says: \u201cSurvey respondents commented on renewed caution among clients, in response to heightened political and economic uncertainty. Fragile business sentiment led to delayed decision-making on large projects and greater concern about the outlook for workloads during the next 12 months. While construction firms remain upbeat overall about their near-term growth prospects, the degree of confidence fell to its lowest so far this year. The pound is hovering around the $1.293 mark this morning, unchanged on the day. McCafferty and Vlieghe\u2019s divergent comments on interest rates have basically cancelled each other out. Against the euro, the pound is flat too, at \u20ac1.139. That means one euro is worth 87.8p. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale suspects that the pound will weaken against the euro in the months ahead: Gertjan Vlieghe makes the dovish case that hiking too soon is worse than hiking too late, Ian McCafferty is quoted on news wires restating his view that to tighten would be appropriate. Meanwhile, the slow deterioration of the economy continues against a backdrop of equally slow-moving Brexit negotiations. The road to EUR/GBP 0.90 and beyond will be rocky and slow, but we\u2019re on it all the same. As predicted, European stock markets have all dropped at the open. The FTSE 100 has shed 22 points, or 0.3%. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets blames \u201cmore North Korean sabre rattling\u201d, after today\u2019s missile test. The takeover battle for UK modelmaker Hornby chugs on this morning. Hornby has slapped down a takeover offer from its own majority shareholder Phoenix Asset Management. Hornby, the firm behind Airfix planes, Scalextric cars and its eponymous trains, urged shareholders to reject Phoenix\u2019s offer, as: The Hornby Directors believe that the Offer does not reflect an adequate premium for control and significantly undervalues Hornby and its prospects. It\u2019s a tricky situation, though. Last week, Phoenix raised its stake in Hornby over 50%, meaning it had to offer to buy the rest of the shares. Shareholders can resist, but then they\u2019re stuck holding share in a company whose directors are at war with their largest investor.... Despite the consumer slowdown, supermarket chain Sainsbury has beaten City forecasts with its sales growth for the last three months. My colleague Sarah Butler has the details: Strong sales of fresh fruit and veg and a dash for paddling pools, summer clothes and fans helped Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos deliver a big jump in sales growth. Sales at stores open more than a year, excluding fuel, rose 2.3% in the 16 weeks to 1 July, up from 0.3% in the previous three months partly thanks to the warm start to the summer. Mike Coupe, group chief executive, said: \u201cWe have delivered a strong performance, driven by our differentiated strategy, offering customers quality, value and choice across food, general merchandise, clothing and financial services.\u201d He said fresh produce had performed particularly well, outperforming the market with volume growth of 1% as Sainsbury\u2019s cut the price of summer favourites including Jersey Royal potatoes and British strawberries. That helped boost total grocery sales by 3% compared to 0.3% growth in the previous three months. Another day, another division among the Bank of England\u2019s team of interest rate setters. Ian McCafferty and Gertjan Vlieghe are the latest members of the Monetary Policy Committee to give opposing views on whether or not it\u2019s time to raise UK rates, currently at an all-time low of 0.25%. McCafferty, who was among three MPC members to vote for a rate rise at the June meeting, told the Daily Post in North Wales that it would be a \u201cprudent\u201d move to increase borrowing costs. \u201cWe made the last interest rate cut from 0.5% to 0.25% last August after the EU referendum decision when it was felt that a stimulus was needed. Since then the economy has not slowed to the extent we feared it would last summer and meanwhile inflation has been high. \u201cI feel on the balance of monetary policy that there is a need for change. I think this would be justified and would be the prudent thing to do at this stage.\u201d Vlieghe on the other hand says it would be a mistake to raise interest rates now. He\u2019s one of the most dovish members of the MPC, and insists that it would be wrong hike borrowing costs when consumer spending is slowing. He told the Independent: \u201cThis is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late. \u201cI think the consumption slowdown is here, it\u2019s not over. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a sufficient offset from investment and net exports to compensate for that.\u201d \u201cWhat I want to emphasise is that I don\u2019t think there is no risk from keeping rates on hold. I just think that we are still in an environment where one of those risks is bigger than the other one.\u201d It all shows that the next BoE interest rate meeting, in August, could be a real clash of wills. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Consumer credit fears have been building in the UK for months. Squeezed families have been forced deeper into debt, and some borrowers have been loosening their lending criteria to keep the loans flowing. And today, the Bank of England is expected to outline how it will rein in lenders who have been doling out credit to consumers too quickly. This follows last week\u2019s meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which flagged up concerns that the credit market \u2013 particularly to buy cars \u2013 was a concern. Reuters has a good take on today\u2019s upcoming announcement, saying: The BoE said last week that a targeted review by its banking supervisory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), had found weaknesses in some aspects of underwriting credit and a reduction in the resilience of banks. On Tuesday, the PRA will make a statement on its first set of specific actions or \u201cexpectations\u201d from the banks it regulates regarding credit to consumers. It will look at a wide range of credit, including the financing of car purchases - though banks now account for a much smaller portion of this than in the past. \u201cEffective governance at firms should ensure that risks are priced and managed appropriately and benign conditions do not lead to complacency by lenders,\u201d the BoE said last week in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report. The statement is expected around 9.30am UK time. At the same time, we\u2019ll also get a new healthcheck on the UK building sector. Markit\u2019s Construction PMI is expected to drop to 55 points, to 56 in May, which would show that growth slowed in June. The report could move the markets, says David Madden of CMC Markets: Homebuilders like Persimmon, Redrow, Bovis Homes and Taylor Wimpey will also be sensitive to the UK construction data. The house builders have benefitted from the Bank of England\u2019s loose monetary policy, and should that policy change, we could see a reversal of fortunes for the sector. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning; not helped by the news that North Korea has just claimed to have tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. And it\u2019s Independence Day in America, so Wall Street will be closed. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England publishes Financial Policy Committee meeting minutes 9.30am: UK construction PMI released 10am: Eurozone producer prices report for May",

If this isn\u2019t in good shape - especially for those relying on major infrastructure projects - and the forecast looks less than positive, it will dampen confidence. To combat this, the government must take decisive action on such projects, including the nuclear sector. However, with the spectre of another general election still looming, there is an unhelpful amount of uncertainty in the market at present.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, fears that builders will struggle to find workers after Brexit:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cMigrant workers are the lifeblood of the sector and while the plan to provide more than three million EU citizens permanent residence is a good start, the ongoing movement of labour within the bloc is still a huge issue.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former Labor minister Craig Emerson has defended the Turnbull government\u2019s review of the petroleum resource rent tax, saying it was wise not to recommend overhauling it for existing oil and gas projects. Emerson, who helped to design the original PRRT in the 1980s, said he agreed with the review\u2019s main recommendation that the tax should be modified significantly only for new projects. He said if it was overhauled for existing projects, and projects in development, it would damage investor confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve suggested a few modifications to the PRRT ... and the Callaghan report effectively agrees, or maybe I agreed in advance with the report,\u201d Emerson told senators on Tuesday. \u201cThe much-discussed design feature of the PRRT is the 15% \u2018uplift\u2019 factor \u2013 the bond rate plus 15% on exploration \u2013 that was very much a reflection of the perceived riskiness of petroleum exploration in Australia [when the PRRT was first designed]. \u201cI think it would be damaging to investor confidence to just put a line through that for pre-existing investments. \u201cBut for investments in the future, it may warrant a reconsideration, and perhaps reducing that [15% uplift factor] to the bond rate plus 5%.\u201d Emerson was speaking at a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance in Sydney on Tuesday, on the second day of hearings about the PRRT. His comments supported the view of Michael Callaghan, a former Treasury official and the former chief of staff to Peter Costello, who wrote the review of the PRRT for the government, and who on Monday defended his controversial recommendation to make minimal changes to the PRRT regime for existing oil and gas projects. \u201cMy judgment was that changes to the design of the PRRT that impacted on existing projects ... would run the very real prospect of increasing perceptions of fiscal risk in Australia and potentially could deter future investments,\u201d Callaghan told senators on Monday. The Callaghan review was released in April and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, released a consultation paper on the review on Friday. The review acknowledged one of the most controversial design features of the PRRT was the so-called \u201cuplift rate\u201d for exploration deductions that compound over the life of oil and gas projects, which has allowed oil and gas giants to accumulate nearly $240bn in tax credits. At the moment, uplift rates can be as high as the long-term bond rate plus 15 percentage points, and a submission by the Australian Tax Office to the review showed that, thanks to those generous uplift rates, the LNG sector had accumulated tax credits, or \u201ccarry forward expenditure\u201d, worth $237.8bn by 2015-16, up from $187bn the previous year. At the same time, the PRRT paid on taxable profit had fallen to $845m, from $1.2bn the previous year. The Callaghan review has recommended future projects should avoid these \u201cexcessively high uplift rates\u201d for carrying forward deductions into future years when profits are stronger. But it said no such change should be imposed on existing projects because it would damage Australia\u2019s reputation for sovereign risk. On Monday, the Tax Justice Network criticised the review\u2019s position on uplift rates for existing projects, saying it was a capitulation to the oil and gas industry. Independent journalist Michael West gave evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday and was scathing of the corporate tax avoidance culture generally in Australia. He pulled the senators\u2019 interests back to the original point of the tax avoidance inquiry, which was to examine the amount of tax avoidance occurring across the entire economy, not just in the oil and gas industry. He said multinationals were deliberately undermining parliament\u2019s attempts to crack down on corporate tax avoidance, including its base erosion and profit-shifting plans. Emerson said profit-shifting was one of the biggest problems with the offshore gas industry, too. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about, is the profit-shifting problem,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cPrimarily that\u2019s what these hearings were about \u2013 now this is about the PRRT. If you got the primary tax right, then the secondary tax, you know, with these sorts of modifications, can do its work.\u201d On Monday, Dr Diane Kraal from Monash University told senators the PRRT regulations still needed to be fixed, because they allowed gross undervaluing of the \u201cgas transfer price\u201d of the PRRT, which was one of the central design features of the tax. She said flaws in the method of calculating the gas transfer price (GTP) meant the Australian government was losing out on millions of dollars in tax. \u201cThe GTP method is not used in the calculation of North West Shelf royalties or Queensland State royalties for its onshore coal seam gas,\u201d Kraal later told Guardian Australia. \u201cNeither the Australian Tax Office nor the Department of Industry Innovation and Science, in their testimonies on Monday, could explain the method. \u201c[It] needs to be remedied immediately.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "John Varley, the former chief executive of Barclays, and three former colleagues have appeared at Westminster magistrates court to face fraud charges. Varley appeared in the dock with Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath on Monday following the announcement by the Serious Fraud Office last month that they were to be prosecuted over the way Barclays raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. They are the first senior bankers to face criminal charges for events dating back to the banking crisis almost a decade ago, when Barclays raised \u00a311.8bn in emergency funds from a number of big investors, including Qatar. The four are charged alongside Barclays itself. In a packed courtroom, the four sat alongside each other in the glass-panelled dock and spoke only to confirm their name, date of birth and address. They were told to attend Southwark crown court \u2013 to where the case is being transferred \u2013 on 17 July. Kalaris, a dual US-UK citizen resident in London, and Jenkins, a British citizen resident in Malibu, California, were required to provide security of \u00a3500,000 within seven days by Emma Arbuthnot, the senior district judge overseeing the hearing. Varley and Boath were granted unconditional bail. No formal pleas have been made but the BBC reported that all four would plead not guilty. The charges relate to two fundraisings: one in June 2008 and one in October. Both fundraisings involved two investment vehicles related to Qatar. Another of the charges relates to a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan advanced to Qatar in November 2008. Varley, Jenkins, Kalaris \u2013 all 61 \u2013 and Boath, 58, along with the bank are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to the fundraising in June 2008. Varley, Jenkins and the bank are also charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to the fundraising that took place in October 2008. Varley, Jenkins and the bank face a further charge of providing unlawful financial assistance through the loan. Varley was chief executive of Barclays until the end of 2010. Kalaris ran the wealth management arm of Barclays. Jenkins is a former head of Middle East and north African investment banking, and Boath is a former head of the bank\u2019s European financial institutions group.",
