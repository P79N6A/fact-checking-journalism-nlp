      "bodyText": "TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding has insisted the company\u2019s cybersecurity is \u201chead and shoulders\u201d better than its competitors in the wake of the massive hack attack affecting thousands of customers. In an interview with the Guardian, Harding conceded it would be \u201cnaive\u201d to rule out the prospect of the telecoms firm suffering a similar cyber-attack in the future, describing the threat from hackers as \u201cthe crime of our generation\u201d. Asked about claims by an IT researcher that he raised concerns about TalkTalk\u2019s security with her office last September, Harding said its security had \u201cimproved dramatically\u201d in the last year. She said: \u201cWe are understandably the punchball for everybody wanting to make a point at the moment. Nobody is perfect. God knows, we\u2019ve just demonstrated that our website security wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 I\u2019m not going to pretend it is \u2013 but we take it incredibly seriously. \u201cOn that specific vulnerability, it\u2019s much better than it was and we are head and shoulders better than some of our competitors and some of the media bodies that were throwing those particular stones.\u201d TalkTalk is unable to say how many of its 4 million customers were affected by the major data breach, in which peoples\u2019 names, addresses and partial bank account details were stolen. The company said on Saturday that the amount of information was \u201cmaterially lower\u201d than first feared and insisted that it would be impossible for customers to lose any money solely as a result of last Wednesday\u2019s cyber-attack. Harding said it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether the company will establish a compensation fund to handle the fallout from the attack because it was still unclear how many customers had been affected and to what degree. Detectives from Scotland Yard\u2019s cybercrime unit are investigating the hack attack specialists amid reports that specialists from BAE Systems have been called in by TalkTalk to track down the hackers. Harding declined to comment on whether she believed those behind the attack would be caught or say whether the company would rule out paying a ransom demand, which was received by the firm before it went public with news of the breach. Asked whether she could promise customers that such an attack would never happen again, Harding said: \u201cNo, that would be naive. It would be naive to say something like this will never happen again to any business. \u201cDigital safety is no different to physical safety. You can do your upmost to minimise it. You can arm yourself to protect yourself, but in the end there are criminals everywhere and that\u2019s the way of the world. It\u2019s usually tempting to say there will never ever be another attack but that would be naive.\u201d Paul Moore, an information security consultant, wrote in a blogpost published last September that he had contacted Harding\u2019s office about vulnerabilities on TalkTalk\u2019s website but said the company\u2019s response was \u201caggressive, defensive and dismissive\u201d. At the time Moore gave TalkTalk a poor cybersecurity rating after running tests on its website, but its score was later increased after the company took steps to fix the vulnerability. Harding, who was elevated to the House of Lords last year with the promise of raising awareness of the dangers facing children online, described hacking as \u201cthe crime of our generation\u201d and said it affected every major company in the world. She also hit out at \u201cscaremongering\u201d by media commentators in the wake of the attack, insisting that it was \u201cvery irresponsible\u201d to whip up \u201cmass hysteria\u201d about the dangers of the internet. \u201cWe are really frustrated with the number of sensationalist claims that are being made, not just about TalkTalk as a company but more importantly about customers losing millions and millions of pounds,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually very irresponsible because it\u2019s whipping up fear about the digital world. Goodness knows I\u2019ve been one of its biggest fans ... and it\u2019s not right that having lost your bank account number and sort code that people can take money from your bank account \u2013 they can\u2019t.\u201d Harding insisted that TalkTalk would \u201cthrive\u201d following the attack if customers saw that it was being transparent about what had happened. She said: \u201cWe and our customers are the victim of a criminal attack. What we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 and it\u2019s very painful and hard for everybody in the organisation working their socks off \u2013 is to be open and transparent about it and share the information maybe earlier than people are used to, so we can warn our customers and protect them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barclays will become the focus of the bank reporting season this week amid speculation it is to appoint former investment banker Jes Staley as its new chief executive. The City is awaiting a formal announcement on his recruitment during the third quarter reporting season, which kicks off this week. Staley, who previously worked at JP Morgan, was first tipped for the job a fortnight ago, but his appointment has not been confirmed. It has prompted speculation that, in appointing a veteran investment banker, Barclays is aiming to revive the riskier parts of its operations. Staley would replace Antony Jenkins who was forced out in July. The banking sector results come just days after the Competition and Markets Authority stepped back from any draconian steps to break up the biggest players. Barclays reports on Thursday while bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland report in the coming days. HSBC, which is reviewing whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, publishes its results in a week\u2019s time, as does Standard Chartered. At Barclays, the chief executive\u2019s role is temporarily being filled by the new chair, John McFarlane, whose remarks in recent weeks have raised questions about the bank\u2019s strategy. He has voiced concerns about the ability of investment banks to compete with US rivals and floated the idea of a tie-up between European investment banks. He also appeared to be calming fears that the investment bank \u2013 which was being scaled back by Jenkins \u2013 will be reinvigorated. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, noted that the US investment banks with which Barclays competes had a weak third quarter and that the bank\u2019s African business could be hit by the value of the South African rand. \u201cThat aside, we will be hoping to get some clarity on strategy given John McFarlane\u2019s recent comments about the need to create a European mega-investment bank to compete with US rivals and the potential appointment of Jes Staley as it new chief executive,\u201d Greenwood said. The bank has not confirmed Staley as its favoured candidate. But Bloomberg quoted McFarlane last week as saying: \u201cIf we hire him, we\u2019re not hiring an investment banker.\u201d Staley was, McFarlane said, \u201ca client guy\u201d who \u201cstarted out as a commercial banker, like me. We might have hired someone who\u2019s run an investment bank; well, I\u2019ve run an investment bank. People have jumped to conclusions.\u201d For RBS, the publication of its results on Friday comes just days before a new window opens for the government to resume the sell-off of its stake, which has fallen to 73% from 79% after the first sale in August. The government pledged not to sell any more shares for 90 days, which means from 2 November it could look for buyers. However, there is speculation the stake will not be cut any further until the results of stress tests, due to be unveiled on 1 December. Lloyds will be publishing figures for the first time since George Osborne announced that the public would be able to buy shares at a discount next year. The results will be closely analysed for any further provisions for payment protection insurance mis-selling and analysts appear divided on whether the \u00a313bn it has already set aside to tackle claims will be enough. A progress report is also expected from National Australia Bank on its plans to spin off its Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking operations when it reports its full-year results. A stock market flotation is regarded as the most likely option for the banks, which employ more than 7,000 people and have been knocked by fines and compensation payouts for mis-sold PPI and interest rate swaps.",

      "bodyText": "Some Barclays customers had trouble getting money from their accounts and making payments as the bank carried out maintenance work before the clocks went back last night. Barclays said a glitch occurred in its computer system on Saturday before planned adjustments to coincide with the end of British summer time. The bank said the work related to the clocks changing did not cause the problem but that it meant systems took longer to be restored on Sunday. The bank said: \u201cWe can confirm that customer services are now recovering from the outage we experienced [on Saturday]. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused.\u201d Barclays tweeted around midday on Saturday that it was investigating technical problems. The bank then notified customers about the work related to the clocks changing that evening. The bank said the problem was an internal one and was not caused by someone hacking into its computers. Concerns about companies\u2019 cybersecurity are running high after hackers stole data about up to 4 million customers of the phone company Talk Talk. Barclays customers reported various difficulties with their accounts, including not being able to use their debit cards or bank online. The problem at Barclays is the latest computer failure to affect bank customers. The head of the British Bankers\u2019 Association has said banks\u2019 antiquated computer systems are creaking under the strain of customers moving to online and mobile banking. Royal Bank of Scotland was fined \u00a356m for a meltdown in 2012 that left millions of customers locked out of their accounts for days. Barclays said the problem had been fixed and asked customers to use online and digital banking services instead of calling because of large numbers of phone enquiries. Some customers complained about how the bank dealt with their enquiries and said they were still having difficulties.",

      "bodyText": "BP and Shell are set to unveil a drop of more than half in their third-quarter profits this week, raising new questions about their ability to retain dividends and avoid further job losses. BP will report its latest financial figures on Tuesday and the consensus from analysts is that profits will fall by more than 60% to $1.2bn (\u00a3780m). Shell will publish its results two days later, when its earnings could be halved. The plunge in profits is a direct result of the collapse in oil prices since the same period last year, with North Sea Brent blend averaging around $50 a barrel in the last quarter, compared with $102 during the same period in 2014. \u201cThis is going to be one of the worst quarters in years,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst with Oppenheimer brokerage in New York. \u201cOil companies are being forced into a situation where they will have to borrow to pay dividends and that cannot be sustained forever. Hard choices are going to have to be made,\u201d he said. The reduction in oil prices, triggered by a combination of factors including increased global supplies and lower than expected economic growth and energy demand, has already hit oil company share prices hard. Some analysts believe prices could go even lower before they start to recover. BP\u2019s stock market valuation is down by almost 6% this year, following a 22% fall over the previous 12 months. Shell shares are down by more than 17% in 2015, also hit by concern over its proposed \u00a355bn takeover of its rival BG. Even normally steady performers such as ExxonMobil in the US has seen their value on Wall Street slump by 11% over the last 10 months, while many of the smaller independent oil firms have moved into a financial loss. BP and Shell will try to put a positive gloss on the latest figures, with the former reiterating that earlier moves to sell assets and focus on value over volume have left it in better shape than many rivals to survive the downturn. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, will also been keen to trumpet the fact that the future looks much brighter now that the company has finally settled its long-running US court case over the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill five years ago. A record \u00a312bn fine has settled all US federal, state and local claims over the Gulf of Mexico disaster, with payments spread over 18 years, working out at \u00a3700m a year. Shell has recently carried out its own cost reductions by trimming jobs in Aberdeen and by mothballing its drilling operations off Alaska for the foreseeable future. Speculation continues, however, about dividend cuts. The International Energy Agency believes that higher Opec production and a continued slowdown in world economic growth means that the price of oil will remain low throughout 2016.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s premier has said the country\u2019s target for economic growth is not set in stone as the leadership in Beijing prepare to meet and prioritise economic and social goals for the next five years. Li Keqiang said it was not necessary for the economy to grow by the 7% target for this year. Li set the goal in March after China narrowly missed its 7.5% target for last year. China\u2019s economic growth dipped to 6.9% in the third quarter of this year after recording 7% rises in the first two quarters of 2015. The 6.9% rate was the lowest since the 6.2% achieved in the first three months of 2009 when the global economy was in recession. Economists are worried that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is slowing down fast after a large drop in trade that has been felt around the world. The overheated Chinese property market has prompted a contraction in the construction industry while manufacturing output has slumped as exports have fallen. Li gave his speech at the Central Party School, which trains officials. He said: \u201cWe have never said that we should defend to the death any goal, but that the economy should operate within a reasonable range.\u201d His remarks were posted on the central government\u2019s website late on Saturday. China cut its main interest rate last week for the sixth time since November 2014, feeding fears that its economy is about to slow further. If the economy grows by less than 7% this year it will be China\u2019s weakest rate of annual growth for 25 years. The Communist party\u2019s central committee will meet for the first four days of this week to set out its 13th five-year plan. Leaders are likely to set a target for economic growth of about 7% at the meeting, policy insiders told Reuters. Li said the Chinese economy had performed well in the past year amid problems in the global economy. Rising employment, higher tourism spending and growth in the service sector were reasons for optimism, he added. \u201cThe hard work of people up and down the country and the enormous potential of China\u2019s economy gives us more confidence that we can overcome the various difficulties,\u201d he said. Some more upbeat economists have argued that economic growth of about 7% is more realistic for China than the double-digit figures achieved for much of the 2000s. Heavy manufacturing is less important than in the past and services now make up more than half the economy, they point out.",

I had just recounted how I tried to tip a barman in Dublin by asking him to break a \u20ac5 bill and telling him that he only needed to give me \u20ac4 back; they tut-tutted and shook their heads. \u201cHow would you feel if someone tried to give you a dollar every time you wrote a story?\u201d they said. It seems that while visiting Dublin and London this month, I regularly insulted barmen, servers and hotel workers \u2013 many of whom seemed as uncomfortable at being tipped as I felt about not tipping them. Maybe it was the coins that made it feel grubby? Tipping in Europe feels a little bit condescending: you often have to do it with coins, since the smallest paper note is either a \u20ac5 or \u00a35 bill. But I am so hardwired to tip that it felt awful not to. However, when people are properly paid for the jobs that they are doing, they do not need your tips, I was told. And yet there I was, tipping people in Europe just to make myself feel better. Wasn\u2019t I grand? Wasn\u2019t I a generous American, who could afford to tip? In my defense, I was not doing it to show off or to make myself feel superior to those who \u201cserved\u201d me. It was because I had always been taught that tipping is the right thing to do. I started working in restaurants full time at 19. And when I started at the Guardian seven years later, I was still spending my weekends mixing bloody mary mix, hauling high chairs and managing a team of fabulous brunch bunnies. As a manager I did not rely on tips, but the women and men I worked with did. Most people who have worked in restaurants who I know have a love/hate relationship with tipping. In some restaurants servers can make as much as $30-$40 an hour in tips; in others they barely make minimum wage. In the US there are still some states where it is legal to pay tipped employees $2.13 an hour. You read that right: two dollars and 13 cents. That is a legal minimum wage for millions of US workers. Tip money can be good \u2013 great, even \u2013 but often it comes at a cost. Ultimately, it\u2019s the customers who pay your bills, and if that means letting them flirt or stare at your chest a while longer than acceptable in order to get a bigger tip, then so be it. I have seen it first-hand. \u201cThere is a running joke in the industry that if you are not being sexually harassed, then you are not doing it right,\u201d a bartender told me last year when I was reporting a piece on sexual harassment in the food and drink industry. A report released a year ago by Restaurant Opportunities Centers United found that four out of five women in the restaurant industry experience some form of sexual harassment from customers. The whole system around tipping can be used as a weapon \u2013 and not just against servers. The same way that customers make snap judgments about servers \u2013 not sexy enough, not friendly enough, not fast enough \u2013 servers make similar judgments about customers. Young customers, foreign customers and, yes, customers of color all get worse service because servers often assume they will not tip. Once when I took my mom for a birthday lunch to a New York City restaurant, we spoke Slovak during most of the meal. The server dropped the check before we could even order a dessert. The check included an automatic 18% gratuity. I was mortified. All of this is the reason I tip. I have been programmed \u2013 or brainwashed, if you will \u2013 to believe that I am responsible for making sure these servers have enough money at the end of the day to pay their bills. It\u2019s a way to say thanks: thank you for serving me today, thank you for being a part of my experience. My discomfort around not tipping is a product of all that. It\u2019s also how US restaurants get away with paying their workers such low wages. They make us believe it has always been that way, that their business would go under if they had to pay their staff regular wages. If I have learned anything from my trip, it\u2019s that it is possible to create a culture where servers, hotel workers and other employees do not have to rely on tips to make ends meet. So go ahead, Danny Meyer, end tipping. It might make me uncomfortable, but it\u2019s the right thing to do.",

    "webTitle": "Why China's interest rate cut may be bad news for the world economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The People\u2019s Bank of China was preparing to spring a surprise while President Xi Jinping was taking a selfie with Manchester City star Sergio Aguero. On Friday, the central bank in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy cut the cost of borrowing for the sixth time in a year. This move has implications, none of them especially cheery despite the knee-jerk increase in share prices that followed. Those investors who thought the announcement in Beijing was a big buy signal should ask themselves whether this was a sign of strength or a sign of weakness. It is worth noting that the interest rate move came just days after China released official figures showing that the economy\u2019s annual growth rate had slowed down in the third quarter, but only to a still healthy looking 6.9%. After all the stock market turmoil in August, that was a strong performance and it had the desired effect of reassuring markets that the authorities were in control of the planned rebalancing of the economy towards more modest but better quality growth. But as all commentators know, China\u2019s official figures are not worth the paper they are written on. The fact that interest rates were cut four days after the latest growth data was released underlines the point. Danny Gabay at Fathom thinks China\u2019s real growth rate is 3%, and the rate cut late on Friday night suggests he is right. The good news for the PBoC is it has plenty of scope to cut rates further from their current level of 4.35% should the economy not respond to the stimulus provided. Unlike other central banks, it has not already cut the official cost of borrowing to zero (and in some cases below zero). The bad news is that it might need all the leeway it has available. That\u2019s certainly the view of Gerard Lyons, a China expert at Standard Chartered before he became economic adviser to Boris Johnson. Lyons thinks that sooner or later China will join the rest of the central bank pack. But it is not just in China that things are looking a bit dicey. On the day before the PBoC cut rates, the European Central Bank dropped the broadest of hints that in December it will announce new growth-boosting measures for the eurozone. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, has options. He could cut the ECB\u2019s deposit rate, already -0.2%, still further and thus penalise banks that want to park money with the central bank. More likely, though, the ECB will turn to its version of quantitative easing and increase its bond-buying programme from the current \u20ac60bn (\u00a343bn) a month. Japan is also poised to provide more stimulus later this week when official figures are likely to show the economy back in recession. As with the ECB, a central aim of the policy is to secure a competitive advantage by bearing down on the exchange rate. But if the yen and the euro are weakening, something else has to be strengthening, and the upshot will be that the US dollar will rise. With the US economy showing signs of slowing, the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, will put on ice any plans to raise interest rates, for fear that this will drive the dollar even higher. So what\u2019s the problem? China, Japan and the eurozone are all easing policy. The US is going to delay tightening policy. More stimulus equals stronger growth and fends off the threat of deflation. That\u2019s got to be good, hasn\u2019t it? Well, only up to a point. Problem number one is that by deliberately weakening their exchange rates, countries are stealing growth from each other. Central banks insist that this does not represent a return to the competitive devaluations and protectionism of the 1930s, but it is starting to look awfully like it. Problem number two is that the monetary stimulus is becoming less and less effective over time. There are two main channels through which QE operates. One is through the exchange rate, but the policy doesn\u2019t work if all countries want a cheaper currency at once. Then, as the weakness of global trade testifies, it is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. The other channel is through long-term interest rates, which are linked to the price of bonds. When central banks buy bonds, they reduce the available supply and drive up the price. Interest rates (the yield) on bonds move in the opposite direction to the price, so a higher price means borrowing is cheaper for businesses, households and governments. But when bond yields are already at historic lows, it is hard to drive them much lower even with large dollops of QE. In Keynes\u2019s immortal words, central banks are pushing on a piece of string. Nor is that the end of it. Charlie Bean, until recently deputy governor of the Bank of England, is the co-author of a new report that looks at the impact of persistently low interest rates. It concludes there is a danger that periods when interest rates are stuck at zero are likely to become more frequent, resulting in a greater reliance on unconventional measures such as QE that are subject to diminishing returns. \u201cSecond, and possibly more importantly, a world of persistently low interest rates may be more prone to generating a leveraged \u2018reach for yield\u2019 by investors and speculative asset-price boom-busts.\u201d The current vogue is for macro-prudential policies \u2013 attempts to prevent bubbles from developing in specific asset markets, such as housing. But the paper makes the reasonable point that the macro-prudential approach \u2013 yet to be tried in crisis conditions \u2013 might not work. There is, therefore, a risk that tighter monetary policy in the form of higher interest rates will have to deployed in order to deal with the problems that monetary policy has created in the first place. Bean and his co-authors conclude that the maxing out of monetary policy puts a higher value on fiscal policy \u2013 the use of tax and spending \u2013 and structural reform. There is certainly a strong case for the former, particularly in the form of higher public investment, but at present this is not the way the ideological wind is blowing. The wrong sort of structural reform, such as weakening collective bargaining, will depress aggregate demand and end up doing more harm than good. This is a time for caution. The fact that central banks feel the need to provide more stimulus more than six years into a recovery is not a reason to load up on shares or, indeed, any risky assets. Rather, it is a sign of trouble ahead. If the global economy requires a fresh growth boost, it means that an already feeble recovery is waning. If it doesn\u2019t, it means there is a heightened risk of a new financial crash or higher inflation.",

      "bodyText": "Want to turn up the volume on your car radio? Just make a clockwise motion with your finger. Open the sunroof? Just raise four fingers in a backward sweep. Those were among the futuristic driving concepts unveiled by car manufacturers at the Consumer Electronics Fair in Las Vegas earlier this year, as the big automotive groups follow the lead of games console manufacturers by utilising cameras that can recognise movement. The technology is expected to become more widespread in cars, laptops and kitchens in coming years. But without their sense of touch to rely on, how can users be sure that their gesture into thin air has worked? In Bristol, a young company is working with sound waves to bring that feel back, in effect creating invisible buttons in the air, enabling people to feel without touching. \u201cYou\u2019re driving and say you want to change the radio or whatever. Now you look at the knob and you adjust it. The problem with just using a gesture is that people say: \u2018Did that work, I\u2019m not sure,\u2019\u201d says Steve Cliffe, chief executive of Ultrahaptics. \u201cThey need that feedback.\u201d The company\u2019s technology uses sound waves from tiny speakers which work together to create sensations on the skin of the user. These sensations can work to create a virtual button, slider or control, meaning the user gets the sensation of feeling an object that isn\u2019t actually there. The sound waves can be controlled to overlap at the same time, thus generating a force on the skin. That vibration can then be manipulated to create different types of textures and feelings. Ultrasound speakers are more common in parking alert systems in cars. The technology can also be used to control devices such as cooker hobs, televisions, car radios and laptops. \u201cSound waves are just pressure waves moving through the air so all the pressure from all the different waves adds together, creating a very localised area of very high pressure. The result of that is that enough force will be emitted to push on your skin,\u201d co-founder Tom Carter said. The Ultrahaptics technology works with motion sensor cameras which tell it where the hand is at any one time so it can judge what sensation the speakers need to send. \u201cThe application says that the hand is here and is doing this, it has pressed a button. We need to create a button click at this 3D coordinate which goes through our algorithms which figures out how to trigger the speakers to create that sensation. We are the feedback, the feeling,\u201d said Carter. The elaborate system of feeling without touching is illustrated through a grid of 256 tiny speakers connected to a laptop in their offices in Bristol. In one demonstration, the user puts their hand above the grid of speakers while a program shows bubbles rising up on the screen. The computer knows where the hand is via a motion sensor camera and then the speakers send sensations to the hand when the bubbles on screen rise up to \u2018hit\u2019 the hand. In another example, a version of the vintage Breakout game is played with the bat controlled by the hand. When the ball hits the bat at a particular place, a vibration is sent via the transmitters and the player again \u201cfeels\u201d it. By using two dimensional arrays of speakers, objects which appear on screen or in virtual reality headsets could be felt, says Carter. These simple demonstrations show some of the things the Ultrahaptics system is capable of, says the company. The aim, adds Carter, is to decrease the amount of thought needed in controlling a device, such as a games console. \u201cYou have a 50-inch television on your wall and the [console] is giving you two buttons, filling your 50-inch screen and you have to press one of them. You have no reference point of where the button is. \u201cThe button is there and I have to pretend to press it over here. Where is the button? Is it here? Is it there? If you watch people, they make a really big gesture in trying to control the screen which is not so bad in your living room for a games console but if you want to take it out to any other environment, in the streets, on your phone, in a laptop, it is too big. \u201cIf you put your hands up and you get two feelings on your fingertips, pressing the one you want is a lot easier to do.\u201d Interest in the system has been widespread, from carmakers and computer companies to makers of kitchen products. Cliffe suggests an application where instead of touching a hob with dirty hands to adjust temperature, a knob would be controlled in mid-air. People who suffer from tremors caused by Parkinson\u2019s disease might also be able to benefit from the technology. In theory, a switch or dial created by the Ultrahaptics system could be triggered by someone\u2019s hand, even if it shook, says Carter. \u201cFrom the offset we can design all of the interfaces to be universally accessible to everybody and by keeping that in mind you can cover everybody from the elderly to the fully able, children, people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and the blind. These devices can be made so that everyone can use them in the same way.\u201d The buttons in hospital lifts, known as a hive for bacteria, could also be simulated so that medics and patients do not have to touch them, says Cliffe. The first product using the software, which is licensed by Ultrahaptics, is likely to be released next year, although exact details have not been revealed. Gesture control Most car companies have been working on integrating gesture controls into vehicles for the last five years, according to Cliffe. The new BMW 7 Series uses 3D sensors to turn the volume in the car up or down and to accept or reject calls. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this year, Volkswagen showed off a concept car without buttons or knobs inside and which relied on swipes to raise or lower the windows and open the sunroof.

Another 120,000 have registered with investment group Hargreaves Lansdown. After all, the 5% discount on offer from the government is not to be sniffed at, nor is the promise of a one-for-10 bonus share if investors hold on for a year. This week potential investors will have a chance to catch up with just how Lloyds is performing. Over the past five years the bank has racked up cumulative losses of \u00a34.2bn, according to Investec, but the third-quarter statement on Wednesday should show improvement. Investec is forecasting a 3% rise in underlying profit since the previous quarter to \u00a32.3bn. There could, however, be more provisions for mis-sold payment protection insurance, but the end of that saga may well be in sight at last.

But Deutsche added: \u201cWe nevertheless expect a hike in TV customer additions in the second quarter whilst broadband net adds remain more stable. BT is running hard on cost control to limit the impact of Uefa so we expect a reiteration rather than any change to full-year guidance.\u201d BT has other issues to resolve, including growing competition as the likes of Virgin Media continue to expand, a regulatory decision on BT\u2019s proposed acquisition of EE and the outcome of calls for BT to be split up, with Openreach, the division that operates BT\u2019s network, spun off into a separate company. On their mettle With one in six steel jobs in Britain under threat, MPs will be grilling representatives of the industry as well as government this week over the crisis hitting the sector. Cheap Chinese steel, high energy costs and the strong pound have dealt heavy blows to UK producers. The latest came just as Chinese premier Xi Jinping was arriving for a state visit \u2013 when Tata Steel announced 1,200 job cuts in Scunthorpe and Scotland, partly blamed on \u201ca flood of cheap imports, particularly from China\u201d. The Tata announcement followed news of steel products company Caparo Industries going into administration \u2013 hitting 1,700 workers \u2013 and the closure of the SSI plant in Redcar, with the loss of 2,200 jobs. Among those appearing before the business select committee on Tuesday are Tor Farquhar, human resources director at Tata Steel Europe, Gareth Stace of trade association UK Steel, and Anna Soubry, minister for small business, industry and enterprise. The chair of the committee, Iain Wright, said: \u201cWe will be pressing the government to explain what action it is taking now to help the steel industry through this crisis, and its plans to support the industry as part of a competitive and dynamic manufacturing sector in the long term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron is \u201cdelighted\u201d that MPs backed the Conservatives\u2019 plans for swingeing tax credit cuts last week. George Osborne told MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d about the \u201cjudgment call\u201d he had made. For the families who will receive letters in the coming weeks revealing precisely how much they will lose in April \u2013 \u00a31,000 a year for more than 3 million households, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies \u2013 that language will seem uncaring, casual even. But the chancellor\u2019s choice of words, in particular, is revealing of something else. Cutting tax credits is not a necessity: it\u2019s a \u201cjudgment call\u201d \u2013 a deliberate act of policy. As Osborne framed it, the cuts result from a binary choice between allowing taxpayer support for working families to balloon unsustainably, and shifting to \u2013 his current catchphrase \u2013 a low-welfare, high-wage economy. But the roots of that choice go back a long way. In the wake of the financial crisis, Osborne deliberately opted to make deficit reduction the framing narrative for economic policy. It helped to pin the causes of the crisis on a less-than-prudent Labour party, summon old myths about the spendthrift left, and allow him to paint himself as a cautious homeowner \u201cfixing the roof while the sun is shining\u201d. The government\u2019s fiscal charter puts that deficit-cutting obsession in black and white. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, may have taken his time getting there, but in opposing it, he made exactly the right argument. No mainstream economist believes that aiming to run an outright surplus on the public finances, year after year, is necessary or even wise. There\u2019s a second choice involved here, too, though: putting the weight heavily on spending cuts rather than tax rises to balance the books \u2013 about 80%-20% over the past five years. Osborne\u2019s policy since 2010 has consistently leant more heavily on shrinking what he saw as a bloated state than increasing taxes. And canny positioning by Ed Balls during the election campaign goaded the chancellor into publicly ruling out a series of possible tax rises \u2013 including a VAT increase \u2013 reducing the Treasury\u2019s post-election room for manoeuvre considerably. Osborne did announce tax rises in his July budget, which will raise a net \u00a39bn by 2018-19, hitting buy-to-let investors and the drivers of gas-guzzling cars, among other victims unlikely to provoke many public tears. But spending cuts continue to dominate. And the government has made a third choice \u2013 picking its targets. The state pension has been protected since 2010 by the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, originally a Liberal Democrat policy, which Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said last week would eventually prove unsustainable. A report from the Government Actuary\u2019s Department, which was briefly published and then removed from the web earlier this month \u2013 but not before being spotted by eagle-eyed journalists \u2013 suggested that maintaining the triple lock is costing \u00a36bn a year compared to just increasing state pensions in line with earnings. That would be more than enough to reverse the tax credit changes. Other groups have been the beneficiaries of the chancellor\u2019s generosity too. Corporation tax, already the joint lowest among G20 countries, alongside Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, is set to be cut again. It was 28% in 2010; it will be 18% by 2020. The latest two-percentage-point cut, announced in July, will cost \u00a32.5bn a year by 2020. The government would argue a lower rate attracts investment and helps create jobs; but it\u2019s hard to see the rationale for continuing a race to the bottom you\u2019ve already won. Higher earners have been winners too, with the threshold for higher rate tax set to rise, and wealthy homeowners allowed to pass on a larger property to their children free of inheritance tax. Yet while doling out goodies to these less-than-needy groups, July\u2019s budget coolly and deliberately targeted millions of low-paid, hard-pressed families. Osborne\u2019s continued refusal to publish a full distributional analysis of the policies (Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has given him until 31 October to do so) suggests he is not as \u201ccomfortable\u201d as he claims. When challenged about the tax credit cuts, Osborne trumpets his new \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the extension of free childcare and the planned increase in the personal tax allowance. Yet most of the boost from these measures will not be felt by tax credit recipients. Many already have most of their childcare costs paid for, and the personal tax allowance is already high enough to exclude many lower earners. But most importantly, as work by the Resolution Foundation has painstakingly pointed out, the structure of the cuts \u2013 which both reduce the earnings level at which tax credits are lost and increase the rate at which they are withdrawn \u2013 means many tax credit recipients will see almost all the benefit of higher wages wiped out. So a single-earner household earning \u00a315,000, for example (tax credits are awarded according to household income), will face a \u00a31,500 cut in tax credits; but if they seek to increase their working hours to offset that loss, for each extra \u00a31 they earn, an extraordinary 80p will be lost in taxes and reduced benefit payments. Flip that around and it\u2019s an 80p marginal tax rate on any extra earnings. Now there\u2019s a fraught and complex debate in economics about taxation and work incentives; but few of us would rush to take on extra hours if we could only take home \u00a31 in every \u00a35 we earned. And that\u2019s why even rightwing thinktanks the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute for Economic Affairs, hardly the skivers\u2019 friends, criticised the policy last week: it will undermine work incentives. Sam Bowman of the ASI said: \u201cThe government has long claimed to want to make work pay for everyone, but cutting tax credits would disincentivise work and hurt those at the bottom of society.\u201d Tax credits cuts may yet be the policy that sees Osborne\u2019s carefully constructed political edifice start to crumble. He chose austerity over investment, cutting back the state over taxing the rich, rewarding the comfortable over protecting the needy. And as Heidi Allen\u2019s powerful maiden speech showed last week, those \u201cjudgment calls\u201d may finally have caught up with him, by leading to policies even his own backbenchers are struggling to defend.",
