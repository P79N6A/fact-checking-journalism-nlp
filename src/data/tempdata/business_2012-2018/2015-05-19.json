      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are continuing to mislead shoppers by tempting them with \u201cdodgy\u201d and misleading special offers, according to a consumer group. Which? has published further evidence of pricing practices used persistently by retailers to create the illusion of savings that do not exist, thereby manipulating consumers\u2019 spending and duping them out of hundreds of millions of pounds. The findings should fuel its long-running campaign to put an end to misleading pricing, which last month culminated in Which? making a \u201csuper-complaint\u201d to the government\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The findings were based on data from the independent shopping website mySupermarket.co.uk using retail pricing practices from January 2014 to April 2015. A separate survey showed that two-thirds (68%) of shoppers say they had bought groceries on a discount offer in the past month, while six in 10 had bought items on multibuy. Which? highlighted pricing practices which could be breaching government guidelines, including \u201ccontinuing offers\u201d, where products are on offer longer than they were sold at the higher price. This makes it appear that shoppers are getting a discount, when the lower \u201cdiscount\u201d price is probably a more accurate reflection of the value of the product. For example, Pepsi Max (2 litres) was sold at \u00a31.98 in Morrisons for 28 days but then went on a \u00a31 \u201cwas \u00a31.98\u201d offer for 63 days. Also of concern were misleading multibuys which did not save customers money or, in some cases, ended up costing more. For example, Asda increased the price of Robinsons Orange Fruit Squash (1 litre) from \u00a31 to as much as \u00a31.59 per bottle while running a \u201c2 for \u00a32.50\u201d offer \u2013 thus creating the illusion of a saving but costing shoppers more. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \u201cRetailers are continuing to pull the wool over shoppers\u2019 eyes with dodgy discounts that just don\u2019t stack up. \u201cOur super-complaint has the backing of tens of thousands of concerned shoppers.\u201d Since receiving the complaint from Which? the CMA has 90 days in which to decide whether to launch a full-blown investigation. But the British Retail Consortium said it did not accept the implications at the heart of the super-complaint. Tom Ironside, BRC director of business and regulation, said: \u201cUK retailers are committed to treating their customers fairly and to avoid misleading them in any way. \u201cThe examples set out are very specific in nature and are not in any way indicative of broader systemic problems across the retail industry.\u201d",

At the CBI\u2019s black-tie bash, Rake will give a speech that contains an obvious hole that would be exploited by any half-alert EU politician or Brussels bureaucrat. Rake will call for businesses to \u201cturn up the volume\u201d in speaking out in favour of the UK\u2019s membership of a \u201creformed\u201d EU. No surprise there. That\u2019s been the CBI\u2019s comfortable stance for years. But the interesting question is whether the CBI\u2019s president would also favour staying in an unreformed EU. Rake, according to the advance version of his script, will come close to saying the answer is yes. \u201cNo one has yet set out a credible alternative future to EU membership,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe current alternatives are not realistic options \u2013 little or no influence and the obligation to comply with EU principles whilst still paying most of the costs. \u201cNorway is the 10th highest contributor to the EU budget \u2013 despite not being a member \u2013 and it took Switzerland nine years to negotiate and implement partial access to the single market. Business must be crystal clear that membership is in our national interest.\u201d That\u2019s Rake\u2019s sincere belief. But, as an opening gambit in a negotiation, it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s almost an admission that, whatever the outcome of the talks, the UK should not contemplate leaving the EU and becoming Norway or Switzerland. If Cameron and Osborne adopted the same position publicly, there would be guffaws on the other side of the table. It would be like easyJet, where Rake used to be chairman, entering price talks with Airbus on new planes by announcing that it is not prepared to buy from Boeing.

In some quarters, big business\u2019s support for EU membership is regarded as a trump card for the pro lobby.

Vodafone: what next after Project Spring? The way Vodafone tells it, a turning point has been reached, or is about to be. Organic service revenue, which ignores handset sales and newly acquired businesses, advanced by the mighty figure of 0.1% in the fourth quarter. At least it reverses a three-year trend. More encouragingly, there\u2019s a glimpse of growth in top-line profits. EBITDA \u2013 or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \u2013 are forecast to be \u00a311.5bn-\u00a312bn in 2015. To those that point out that \u00a311.9bn has just been reported for 2014, Vodafone cites a reworked number of \u00a311.4bn after adjusting for currency moves. OK, if one accepts that contortion, life is looking a little brighter. Vodafone, having sold its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for a princely sum, is closer to demonstrating that it is not a dull utility standing still. Yet you would be hard-pushed to describe the investment prospect as exciting. An awful lot of capital is being deployed to turn the ship. The Project Spring splurge, a once-in-a-generation upgrade of the networks to exploit 4G opportunities, took spending to \u00a319bn over two years. Post-Spring, capital expenditure is due to fall sharply, allowing free cash flow to rise from last year\u2019s \u00a31bn to, say, \u00a34bn-\u00a35bn. Given that the annual dividend costs \u00a33bn, that drop-off in spending is critical. If the important German operation, where revenues fell last year, requires yet more fertilizer to bloom, the dividend calculation won\u2019t be so comfortable. The overhaul of Vodafone still looks a work in progress. Awkward questions for Asda \u201cSales are for vanity, profits are for sanity,\u201d says Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda. Retailers often trot out this line when they have lost market share and Asda\u2019s 3.9% fall in like-for-like sales in the last quarter qualifies on that score. But the motto is also correct: sustainable businesses need to make a profit. So why does Clarke sound so unhappy about rivals\u2019 habit of dishing price vouchers at the checkout? Shouldn\u2019t he cheering opponents\u2019 supposedly doomed and short-termist tactics? Or does he fear that Asda, despite vowing to hold its nerve, will get dragged into the same game eventually? If minus 3.9% is sustained for the whole year, the question will be pressing.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hewlettpackard\">Hewlett-Packard</a> is being sued by MicroTech, a small software reseller it named in a $5bn fraud claim against the founders of the British software group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/autonomycorporation\">Autonomy</a>.</p> <p>MicroTech\u2019s suit says the company is owed $16.5m by HP for Autonomy software that was never properly delivered. It is the latest twist in the battle between HP and the Autonomy founder, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/aug/14/hewlett-packard-autonomy-mike-lynch-clear-name\">Mike Lynch</a>, and his finance director, Sushovan Hussain.</p> <p>The British executives are fighting accusations by HP that they used \u201cimproper\u201d transactions with small software resellers, including MicroTech, to artificially boost their company\u2019s revenues. </p> <p>HP acquired Autonomy for $11bn<strong> </strong>in 2011 but subsequently wrote down its value.</p> <p>Founded by the service-disabled US military veteran Tony Jimenez, Virginia-based MicroTech is a security-cleared contractor specialising in government computing. In a lawsuit filed with the US district court for northern California, the firm alleges breach of contract.</p> <p>It claims Autonomy software, for which it had paid in cash, was never properly delivered, with the keys that would allow it to sell the software on to end users being withheld.</p> <p>\u201cJust because HP is a big company with billions in revenues doesn\u2019t mean it can bully a small business owned by a veteran into not demanding our money back for something never delivered,\u201d Jimenez said.</p> <p>He has employed the attorney Lanny Davis, a former Bill Clinton adviser and White House spokesman, to bring the case.</p> <p>Davis said: \u201cHP is not entitled to keep both MicroTech\u2019s money and Autonomy\u2019s software that MicroTech duly purchased.\u201d</p> <p>The claims relate to two separate transactions, in which MicroTech signed contracts with Autonomy to buy its software for eventual use by two end customers, the Vatican Library and HP itself.</p> <p>In the event, neither the Vatican nor HP bought Autonomy software from MicroTech or from Autonomy.</p> <p>The Vatican deal, concluded in March 2010, saw MicroTech commit to purchase $11.6m of software. MicroTech said it paid $9.2m of that sum in cash to Autonomy. The balance was withheld after it became clear there were \u201cissues\u201d with the deal. MicroTech says it has received no money back, nor has Autonomy delivered the software purchased or the licence keys needed to activate the software.</p> <p>The second transaction took place in June 2011, this time for an advance order of $7.35m of software which was due to be purchased by HP. \u201cAutonomy again misrepresented to MicroTech that it had a deal in place with an end user for Autonomy\u2019s software,\u201d claim MicroTech\u2019s lawyers. The deal never closed and no software or activation keys were issued.</p> <p>MicroTech has offered a compromise: it is asking HP to relicense the software for a period of time to allow it to find an alternative buyer. Jimenez said: \u201cWe are confident a court will agree, the money or the software \u2013 you can\u2019t keep both \u2013 under the law and principles of fairness.\u201d</p> <p>However, MicroTech features prominently in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/05/hewlett-packard-unveils-details-of-5bn-autonomy-case\">fraud case</a> filed with the UK high court earlier this year, in which HP is seeking a record $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) in damages from Lynch and Hussain.</p> <p>HP alleges that MicroTech was in fact paid, with profits, for its purchases of software intended for the Vatican and HP. Its lawyers claim the payments were made using a series of reciprocal deals in which Autonomy bought software and services from MicroTech for a marginally higher value than the software it had agreed to sell to the smaller firm.</p> <p>On 16 August 2011, Autonomy paid MicroTech $8.2m for the development of a \u201cUS Government Federal Cloud Platform for Autonomy Solution\u201d. The platform, lawyers claim, was never delivered and it was never requested by Autonomy.

      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard is being sued by MicroTech, a small software reseller it named in a $5bn fraud claim against the founders of the British software group Autonomy. MicroTech\u2019s suit says the company is owed $16.5m by HP for Autonomy software that was never properly delivered. It is the latest twist in the battle between HP and the Autonomy founder, Mike Lynch, and his finance director, Sushovan Hussain. The British executives are fighting accusations by HP that they used \u201cimproper\u201d transactions with small software resellers, including MicroTech, to artificially boost their company\u2019s revenues. HP acquired Autonomy for $11bn in 2011 but subsequently wrote down its value. Founded by the service-disabled US military veteran Tony Jimenez, Virginia-based MicroTech is a security-cleared contractor specialising in government computing. In a lawsuit filed with the US district court for northern California, the firm alleges breach of contract. It claims Autonomy software, for which it had paid in cash, was never properly delivered, with the keys that would allow it to sell the software on to end users being withheld. \u201cJust because HP is a big company with billions in revenues doesn\u2019t mean it can bully a small business owned by a veteran into not demanding our money back for something never delivered,\u201d Jimenez said. He has employed the attorney Lanny Davis, a former Bill Clinton adviser and White House spokesman, to bring the case. Davis said: \u201cHP is not entitled to keep both MicroTech\u2019s money and Autonomy\u2019s software that MicroTech duly purchased.\u201d The claims relate to two separate transactions, in which MicroTech signed contracts with Autonomy to buy its software for eventual use by two end customers, the Vatican Library and HP itself. In the event, neither the Vatican nor HP bought Autonomy software from MicroTech or from Autonomy. The Vatican deal, concluded in March 2010, saw MicroTech commit to purchase $11.6m of software. MicroTech said it paid $9.2m of that sum in cash to Autonomy. The balance was withheld after it became clear there were \u201cissues\u201d with the deal. MicroTech says it has received no money back, nor has Autonomy delivered the software purchased or the licence keys needed to activate the software. The second transaction took place in June 2011, this time for an advance order of $7.35m of software which was due to be purchased by HP. \u201cAutonomy again misrepresented to MicroTech that it had a deal in place with an end user for Autonomy\u2019s software,\u201d claim MicroTech\u2019s lawyers. The deal never closed and no software or activation keys were issued. MicroTech has offered a compromise: it is asking HP to relicense the software for a period of time to allow it to find an alternative buyer. Jimenez said: \u201cWe are confident a court will agree, the money or the software \u2013 you can\u2019t keep both \u2013 under the law and principles of fairness.\u201d However, MicroTech features prominently in the fraud case filed with the UK high court earlier this year, in which HP is seeking a record $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) in damages from Lynch and Hussain. HP alleges that MicroTech was in fact paid, with profits, for its purchases of software intended for the Vatican and HP. Its lawyers claim the payments were made using a series of reciprocal deals in which Autonomy bought software and services from MicroTech for a marginally higher value than the software it had agreed to sell to the smaller firm. On 16 August 2011, Autonomy paid MicroTech $8.2m for the development of a \u201cUS Government Federal Cloud Platform for Autonomy Solution\u201d. The platform, lawyers claim, was never delivered and it was never requested by Autonomy. A day later, on 17 August, Autonomy received $7.35m in cash from MicroTech, the claim alleges, some of which was logged as payment for software intended for resale to HP. In the case of the Vatican, Autonomy paid MicroTech to set up an \u201cAdvanced Technology Innovation Center\u201d, designed as a facility to display its technology. Lawyers claim that on 31 December 2010, Autonomy paid $9.6m for the centre \u2013 the entire cost of the project \u2013 in advance of its hiring its first member of staff. On the same date a payment of $6.3m was received by Autonomy from MicroTech. HP\u2019s claim lists nine transactions between MicroTech and Autonomy, worth a total of $33m, as questionable. One of those transactions was for $10m of software for use by another reseller, DiscoverTech. Among MicroTech\u2019s founding investors was David Truitt, the chief executive of DiscoverTech. This reseller was involved in $42m of \u201cimproper\u201d transactions with Autonomy, according to the claim. Truitt was also chief operating officer of Microlink. HP\u2019s claim lists $22m of transactions between Autonomy and Microlink, before the reseller was purchased for $57m. Of the money owing, $9m was eventually written off after HP acquired Autonomy. HP\u2019s claim states that Truitt\u2019s brother, Stephen, was chief operating officer of MicroTech, and that another of his brothers was an Autonomy employee. A spokesman for Truitt declined to comment. According to HP\u2019s claim, questionable transactions with a small group of resellers were designed \u201cfor the improper purpose of providing a pretext for the inappropriate or premature recognition of revenue\u201d. Lynch and Hussain reject the allegations and are contesting HP\u2019s legal action. A spokeswoman for HP said: \u201cHP cannot comment as this is a pending legal matter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "High street retailer Next has been hit with a \u00a322.4m tax bill after a court found that it diverted profits made in the UK to offshore havens to avoid paying tax. The ruling, which HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) said could open the door to \u00a3130m of recouped losses from other firms, followed a successful challenge to a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster. The first-tier tribunal (FTT), which is part of the courts system and is overseen by independent adjudicators, ruled in HMRC\u2019s favour after finding Next\u2019s scheme artificially moved money offshore to claim tax relief on overseas profits. HMRC\u2019s director general of business tax, Jim Harra, said: \u201cThis case shows how HMRC takes effective action against big businesses that try to avoid paying tax through convoluted, artificial avoidance schemes. HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes.\u201d Tax experts said such schemes had been used by firms to avoid corporation tax on foreign profits that are then paid back to the UK parent firm. Hundreds of companies sought to exploit complex international treaty rules designed to facilitate global trade by making sure profits are not taxed twice in different jurisdictions. Under rules designed to prevent double taxation of company profits, companies can claim credit for tax paid on money they made overseas. But Next switched funds from one company to another in an arrangement HMRC referred to as \u201ccomplex circular movements of money between companies in the same group, so they can claim there has been double taxation\u201d. This is the second rate-booster case to reach the FTT after the tribunal ruled against P&amp;O in 2013, which was accused of moving profits to avoid tax before its takeover by the Dubai-based DP World. The P&amp;O scheme would have secured \u00a314m in tax relief. It was devised in 2004 by P&amp;O, the ports business that was then independent and listed on the London Stock Exchange. HMRC said about \u00a3130m in tax was at stake across 20 rate-booster cases, which were waiting on the P&amp;O and Next decisions. About 70 rate-boosters have already been conceded by companies rather than go to court, which has brought in more than \u00a3500m in tax. Legal changes in 2005 and 2009 mean rate-booster schemes are no longer possible or attractive. Next, whose chief executive is Tory peer Lord Wolfson, said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC \u201csome years ago\u201d and that this had been fully accounted for at the time. Referring to looser transfer pricing rules brought in by the last coalition government, the retailer went on to describe the dispute with HMRC as \u201ca technical debate around complex legislation\u201d which had now been superseded. The Next statement added that current UK law generally allowed companies to \u201crepatriate their profits without a tax charge\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Climate change dominates marathon Shell annual general meeting", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell shareholders have voted through a resolution requiring it to test its business against international goals to limit climate change \u2013 but Britain\u2019s biggest oil company faced a barrage of questions over its commitment to battle global warming. At its annual general meeting in The Hague, 98.9% of votes supported the call for Shell to report on whether its activities were compatible with a pledge by governments to limit global warming to a 2C rise. The resolution was filed by 150 investors controlling billions of pounds\u2019 worth of its shares, under the banner Aiming for A. It includes a ban on corporate bonuses for activities that damage the climate and a requirement to invest in renewable energy. Several investors who backed the proposal praised Shell\u2019s board for supporting the resolution, which was passed last month at BP. But the annual meeting, which lasted four and a half hours, was dominated by shareholders casting doubt on Shell\u2019s climate change credentials and others criticising its continued efforts to extract fossil fuels. Bill McGrew, a fund manager for the US\u2019s biggest public pension fund, California\u2019s Calpers, applauded the Anglo-Dutch company for recognising that climate change posed a threat to the world and to Shell\u2019s business. He said: \u201cI carry an important message that US investors care. It\u2019s not just a US voice; it\u2019s not just a European voice; it\u2019s a global voice expressing support for your leadership today.\u201d Others were more hostile. Investors from Alaska said Shell\u2019s decision to drill for oil off the state\u2019s northern coast threatened their communities. The board also faced questions on the company\u2019s membership of lobby groups sceptical of climate change, the slow progress in developing renewable energy and the potential worthlessness of its assets under global climate change commitments. Questions came from shareholders representing campaign groups such as Greenpeace and Global Witness but also from individual investors and fund managers. A shareholder from Alaska said her community was in danger after a US government report said there was a 75% chance of at least one oil spill in the next 77 years if Shell was allowed to explore. \u201cWe rely on the ocean for our food. I\u2019m a grandmother with 17 grandkids. They are so afraid right now that with a 75% chance [of a spill] they will never be able to eat our traditional food again.\u201d Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said that figure had been misunderstood and that the chance of a disaster was less than 1%. Van Beurden has criticised the oil industry for being slow to admit to the existence of climate change and for relying too easily on the argument that environmental protection threatens jobs. But a Guardian investigation found that Shell\u2019s own forecasts assume the Earth\u2019s temperature will rise by almost double the 2C danger threshold adopted by governments. Shell is also a member of the American Legislative Council (Alec), a political organisation that opposes policies that try to tackle climate change. A shareholder told the board: \u201cThe international community wants you to change your policy for Earth and mankind. I want to ask you to stop the lobbying against sustainable energy.\u201d In his only expression of irritation during the meeting, Van Beurden replied: \u201cI would suggest that you pay a little bit more attention to what we are doing and saying. I have never and the company has never advocated against renewable energy. We are one of the biggest investors.\u201d He said if Shell disagreed with industry groups it belonged to then the company put forward its own view separately. Several shareholders told the company to go faster in developing alternative sources of energy such as solar power. Mark van Baal, founder of a group of green Shell shareholders, said the company risked becoming redundant \u2013 \u201cthe next Kodak or Nokia\u201d \u2013 if it delayed in switching away from oil and gas. He added: \u201cEnjoy the profit while you have it but let\u2019s invest those profits in renewables, the energy of this century, and not just fossil fuels.\u201d Van Beurden said Shell would be at the forefront of change but that it needed to find more oil in the short term to meet the demands of population growth and economic development in emerging markets. He rejected the idea that Shell could be left with \u201cstranded assets\u201d that cannot be extracted because climate change will make them unviable. He dismissed as a red herring the argument that there was a carbon bubble of investment in fossil fuels. Van Beurden said in the second half of this century solar power would become dominant as a source of energy but that the world would have to rely on oil and other traditional fuels in the meantime. Simon Henry, Shell\u2019s finance director, said fossil fuels made up 80% of the world\u2019s energy sources and that oil was needed to produce and transport food, make clothes and manufacture roofs. \u201cModern life would not be possible\u201d without oil, he said.",

Investors from Alaska said Shell\u2019s decision to drill for oil off the state\u2019s northern coast threatened their communities.

The Bank is asking the public to nominate \u201cpeople of historic significance\u201d from the world of the visual arts, although the final decision will be made by the governor, Mark Carney. The public have two months to choose their candidates. As well as painters and sculptors, the category includes fashion designers, film directors, ceramicists or architects. Living people and fictional characters are barred. The final decision will be announced in spring 2016 and the new note is expected to go into circulation by 2020. Announcing the public consultation at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Carney urged the public to think beyond \u201cthe most famous and the most obvious\u201d. He continued: \u201cBanknotes are the principal way the Bank of England engages with the British public.\u201d Noting that the bank issued its first banknotes in 1694 to pay for the war against France, Carney said: \u201cThese sparse pieces of paper from the 17th century have developed over the years to become the small works of art that are in everyone\u2019s wallets.\u201d \u201cThere are a wealth of individuals within the field of visual arts whose work shaped British thought, innovation, leadership, values and society and who continue to inspire people today. I greatly look forward to hearing from the public who they would like to celebrate.\u201d The unprecedented public consultation \u2013 which will involve school visits and focus groups led by the Bank\u2019s chief cashier, Victoria Cleland \u2013 will be the first test of Threadneedle Street\u2019s new process for choosing banknote characters. Carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the Queen, remained on banknotes, after the Bank decided to phase out the Elizabeth Fry \u00a35 note. That campaign led to Jane Austen being chosen for the next \u00a310 note, which will go into circulation in 2017, a year after the Winston Churchill \u00a35 note. William Shakespeare was the first historical figure to feature on a British banknote, 1970. Since then notes have featured Charles Dickens, the Duke of Wellington, Charles Darwin and Sir John Houblon, the first governor of the Bank of England. The architect Sir Christopher Wren has featured, but neither a painter nor sculptor has ever been chosen. The art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon is a member of the Bank\u2019s independent panel of experts advising on banknote characters. He said the decision to choose a figure from the art-world was long over due. He said \u201cadventurous, innovative\u201d painters such as John Constable and JMW Turner had paved the way for modern artists: \u201cThe history of the British artist is the history of misunderstood genius.\u201d These two artists are likely to emerge as popular choices, while other names mooted include William Blake or George Stubbs. Prof David Solkin, dean of the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and one of world\u2019s leading authorities on the history of British art, said: \u201cBlake would be a good choice. He\u2019s not the most obvious, but is also famous for his poetry, his work beyond his art. He\u2019s someone whose influence has persisted and is in the public consciousness \u2013 we still sing Jerusalem. Most people will know him. \u201cJoshua Reynolds on the other hand may not be the most popular artist, but he was the first president of the Royal Academy, he is the founding father of the British school. \u201cMy choice would be Joseph Wright of Derby, far less obvious but one of the most interesting British artists of the last 300 years, who has a presence in all the national collections. Though Turner is, of course, the most obvious.\u201d After the public consultation closes on 19 July, a panel of experts will draw up a shortlist of eight names, which will be tested in focus groups. This list will then be whittled down to three-five names for the governor to choose from. Bookmaker Ladbrokes said on Tuesday that William Hogarth and Richard Attenborough had emerged as early joint favourites at 4-1 each, followed by Turner at 5-1, Isambard Kingdom Brunel (6-1) and Alexander McQueen (8-1).",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "UK inflation turns negative", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation in Britain has turned negative for the first time in more than half a century, giving a boost to household finances and bolstering expectations that interest rates will remain at a record low for the rest of this year. The Office for National Statistics said its consumer price index measure of inflation was down 0.1% in April from a year ago. That compared with the inflation rate at zero in February and March. Negative turn Statisticians said this was the first time the CPI had fallen since official records began in 1996 and the first time since 1960 based on comparable historic estimates. The fall in living costs will be welcomed by many as it means workers wages go further, after years when pay was falling in real terms. But for savers it means interest rates will remain low and there are also warnings that negative inflation is a symptom of underlying weakness in Britain\u2019s economic recovery. For now, the factors behind falling prices appear to be temporary, economists said. The main downward effect on price changes in April came from air fares and ferry tickets. That was probably down to the earlier timing of Easter holidays this year and so transport prices rose by much less this April compared with a year ago, the ONS noted. The largest upward effect came from motor fuels, which rose this April but fell between March and April in 2014. The Bank of England had already forecast inflation would turn negative at some point this year but predicted it would soon pick up again. Economists agree there is little reason to fear the UK will fall into outright deflation, as seen between 1921 and 1933, which is regarded as a sustained fall in the cost of living, not a temporary decline below zero. Commenting on the figures, chancellor George Osborne said: Today we see good news for family budgets with prices lower than they were a year ago. As the governor of the Bank of England said only last week, we should not mistake this for damaging deflation. Instead we should welcome the positive effects that lower food and energy prices bring for households at a time when wages are rising strongly, unemployment is falling and the economy is growing. Of course, we have to remain vigilant to deflationary risks and our system is well equipped to deal with them should they arise. But Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said there was little cause for celebration: Any relief for households is welcome, but this month\u2019s figures reflect global trends and doesn\u2019t change the reality that many are still struggling to pay the bills. The Government must clearly guard against the risk that business investment might be deferred. We need stronger action now to raise productivity to deliver sustainable growth and rising living standards. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady saw the inflation figures as a sign of a fragile economy and said there were important implication for Osborne\u2019s budget in July. The first period of negative inflation in over half a century could turn out to be the canary in the mine, signalling that there\u2019s something very wrong with the recovery. And with the threat of deflation set to continue, the Chancellor\u2019s plans for extreme cuts risk putting the economy into more serious trouble. Dear Chancellor... The BoE has a government-set target for inflation at 2% and the governor, Mark Carney, has had to send open letters to Osborne explaining why the index is so far off the mark. In the last letter, published a week ago, Carney said inflation should soon \u201cpick up notably.\u201d He reaffirmed that view after today\u2019s figures, stressing that the decline was caused by last year\u2019s big one-off fall in energy prices rather than weak domestic demand. Carney told broadcasters: We expect inflation to be very low over the next few months. But over the course of the year, as we get towards the end, inflation should start to pick up towards our 2 percent target.\u201d Economists were also quick to stress that the UK was not on the brink of outright deflation and noted the slowdown in inflation was largely down to global oil prices, which had tumbled but are now rebounding. Reacting to the drop in prices, Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London said: Enjoy it while it lasts because there is a good chance that inflation will be back in positive territory next month. The emphasis is largely symbolic and it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to most people. Inflation well below the Bank\u2019s target means Carney and his committee of policymakers are under little pressure to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. Ian Stewart, chief economist at consultants Deloitte commented: Falling prices raise consumer spending power and help keep interest rates low. This looks like the mild and benign variety of deflation which is good news for consumers and for growth.",

The main downward effect on price changes in April came from air fares and ferry tickets.

The largest upward effect came from motor fuels, which rose this April but fell between March and April in 2014.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/13/mark-carney-depart-bank-2018-interest-rates\">The Bank of England had already forecast inflation would turn negative </a>at some point this year but predicted it would soon pick up again.

As the governor of the Bank of England said only last week, we should not mistake this for damaging deflation.</p> <p>Instead we should welcome the positive effects that lower food and energy prices bring for households at a time when wages are rising strongly, unemployment is falling and the economy is growing. Of course, we have to remain vigilant to deflationary risks and our system is well equipped to deal with them should they arise.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said there was little cause for celebration:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any relief for households is welcome, but this month\u2019s figures reflect global trends and doesn\u2019t change the reality that many are still struggling to pay the bills.</p> <p>The Government must clearly guard against the risk that business investment might be deferred. We need stronger action now to raise productivity to deliver sustainable growth and rising living standards.</p> </blockquote> <p>TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady saw the inflation figures as a sign of a fragile economy and said there were important implication for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/16/george-osborne-july-budget-austerity-conservatives-deficit\">Osborne\u2019s budget in July</a>.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first period of negative inflation in over half a century could turn out to be the canary in the mine, signalling that there\u2019s something very wrong with the recovery.

      "bodyText": "Asda has revealed its worst sales figures since the 1990s, confirming that it is now the poorest performing of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets. Sales at established Asda stores fell 3.9% in the 15 weeks to 19 April, the worst since the UK\u2019s second largest grocer began reporting quarterly figures in 2006. However, it is understood that the last time Asda performed so badly was back in the days ahead of its 1990s turnaround under Archie Norman and Allan Leighton. The decline at the Walmart-owned chain compares with a fall of 2.9% at Morrisons and a 1.9% dip at Sainsbury\u2019s over similar periods. Tesco\u2019s sales dropped 1% in the three months to 28 February. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when our industry has seen such a dramatic change in market structure,\u201d said Andy Clarke, Asda\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the big grocers are losing market share and the discounters are continuing to grow.\u201d All the major supermarkets are under pressure as grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl, together with other value retailers like Poundland, B&amp;M and Wilko, attract more shoppers. Changing trends towards online shopping and local convenience stores are also hitting traditional supermarket operators, along with shoppers keeping a tight rein on their grocery shopping budgets. Clarke said half the fall in sales during the \u201cchallenging\u201d quarter was the result of price cuts as the group battles to compete in a bitter supermarket price war. Echoing comments from Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe, Clarke said he expected prices to continue to fall across the grocery market for at least the rest of this year and potentially into next year. He insisted that Asda would stick to its plan on cutting prices and investing in its large stores while expanding into new growth areas including petrol forecourts and online groceries. \u201cWe\u2019re only two years into a five-year plan and the strategy is working,\u201d he said. Asda was the first of the major supermarkets to respond to the threat of the discounters. In 2013 it pledged to spend \u00a31bn on price cuts over five years and has since admitted it may have to spend more than that. The retailer has also axed more than 1,000 store management roles to cut costs. \u201cSales are for vanity, profits are for sanity,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI am not afraid of taking tough decisions for the long term. Short-term tactics may win quarters but our strategy is for the long term.\u201d He said all Asda\u2019s stores were profitable, including its largest stores, and so it would not be writing down the value of its property in the same way as all its major rivals. \u201cOur balance sheet is very robust and probably the strongest of the big four,\u201d Clarke said. One analyst said Asda\u2019s poor performance seemed surprising given that it had been swift to respond to changes in shoppers\u2019 behaviour. \u201cAsda has not been immune to the challenge to the superstore arising from complacency, competition and new customer behaviour. Adjusting to the new circumstances is time-consuming and painful with more sorting to do,\u201d said Clive Black of Shore Capital. Asda has cut prices by as much as 4% on some product categories, such as fresh meat, as it tries to bring its prices closer to those of Aldi and Lidl. Clarke said these price drops had resulted in increased market share. The company is also in the process of converting 15 petrol stations it bought last year into Asda outlets. Clarke said the stores were performing \u201cwell ahead of expectations\u201d and he expected to have 100 such outlets within the next five years. However Clarke said Asda had no plans to open small stores in other locations in order to tap into the fast-growing convenience store market. \u201cOnline and click &amp; collect is our convenience solution,\u201d he said. The company has increased the number of click and collect pickup points by 94% to 611 in the past year. Asda is also investing \u00a321m in extending store opening hours to improve customer service. Alex Russo, finance director, said: \u201cThe idea that large stores are something from the past, we don\u2019t subscribe to that.\u201d Asda is now leading the development of online retailing for its parent group Walmart Stores. The US retail giant said spending on e-commerce as well as worker pay increases and currency fluctuations contributed to a 7% drop in first-quarter profit, behind expectations.",

      "bodyText": "Inflation in Britain has turned negative for the first time in more than half a century, giving a boost to household finances and bolstering expectations that interest rates will remain at a record low this year. What does it mean for your finances? And what is negative inflation, anyway? What has happened? The consumer prices index (CPI), a measure of what a basket of goods and services costs, is down 0.1% this April compared with April 2014. In other words, a basket of goods and services that cost \u00a3100.00 in April 2014 would have cost \u00a399.90 in April 2015. Statisticians said this was the first time the CPI had fallen since official records began in 1996 and the first time since 1960 based on comparable historical estimates. In March 1960, prices fell by an estimated 0.6% due to commodity price falls. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said inflation in April was pushed down by air fares and ferry tickets, probably because of the earlier Easter holidays this year. Transport prices rose less between March and April this year, compared with 2014. Inflation has been slowing throughout most of the last two years on the back of falling food and energy prices. I\u2019m confused. Is this deflation or negative inflation? Economists tend to define a brief dip below zero as \u201cnegative inflation\u201d, to distinguish what is likely to be a temporary spell of falling prices on the back of one-off factors from outright deflation. Having said that, the ONS used the headline \u201cUK enters deflation\u201d on Tuesday morning. Economists also look at core inflation, which strips out the more volatile prices such as energy and food to judge whether we should fear sustained deflation. Core inflation in April was 0.8%, the lowest since March 2001, but still well above zero. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says what we see in the latest figures is not deflation. Deflation is a generalised and sustained fall in prices, not a brief dip into negative territory on the back of moves in the oil price or one-off factors such as the timing of Easter, which has played a role in these latest figures. If core inflation were falling it would be deflation.\u201d Philip Shaw, economist at Investec agrees. The title of the ONS note \u2018UK enters deflation\u2019 released this morning suggests the UK statistics office put today\u2019s numbers in this category. However, we prefer to classify this as \u2018negative inflation\u2019, with deflation more strictly defined as a period of falling prices that are both sustained and general (i.e. not restrained to one or two sectors). Our own view is that this negative April print will not turn into a sustained run.\u201d Economists also talk about different kinds of deflation, good and bad. Similarly, the chancellor, George Osborne, has warned against panicking over this drop into negative inflation. He said: As the governor of the Bank of England said only last week, we should not mistake this for damaging deflation.\u201d What about hidden inflation? I swear chocolate bars are shrinking. It\u2019s a common feeling. Your favourite chocolate bar seems to be getting smaller. You could have sworn there used to be more tea bags in a pack. Yet the price is the same as it always was, sometimes it has even gone up. So is this inflation via the back door? There are indeed plenty of well-known products that have got smaller without retailers dropping their prices.

A recent case was the move this Easter to five-packs of Cadbury\u2019s Creme Eggs, downsized from the old half dozen.

      "bodyText": "The wolf is still on Wall Street. According to a report released on Tuesday a third of financial executives who said they made more than $500,000 annually \u201chave witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace\u201d. A quarter would conduct insider trading if they were guaranteed $10m \u2013 and knew they would get away with it. Five years after the financial crisis and following a series of regulatory changes, high-profile prosecutions, fines and a handful of jailings, attitudes to wrongdoing in the US and the UK seem unchastened. \u201cNearly one in five respondents feel financial service professionals must sometimes engage in unethical or illegal activity to be successful in the current financial environment,\u201d according to the survey of 1,200 traders, portfolio managers, investment bankers and hedge fund professionals on both sides of the Atlantic. The survey, conducted by the University of Notre Dame in conjunction with Labaton Sucharow, a law firm that often represents whistleblowers, noted \u201ca marked decline in ethics\u201d since they last published their report two years ago. Attitude problems are worse in the UK than in the US \u2013 or perhaps the respondents were more honest. According to the report 24% of respondents in the US would use non-public information to make a guaranteed $10m, if there was no chance of getting found out. In the UK that figure rose to 32%. The survey found men were marginally more cynical than women, with 27% of males saying they would probably engage in insider trading to make $10m if there was no chance of being arrested, against 22% of women. In the UK 34% of men said they would engage in this insider trading scenario, compared with 23% of women. Looking at their own companies, 23% of respondents said it was \u201clikely\u201d their colleagues had engaged in illegal or unethical behaviour. In the UK that figure was 28%. Both percentages were a marked increase on the last survey, which found 12% believed their fellow employees would act unethically. Even after all the fines, new regulation and public censure, new employees have less confidence in their colleagues than those with more experience. Close to a quarter of those with less than 10 years\u2019 experience reported believing colleagues had made \u201cethical or illegal compromises in order to get ahead\u201d. That figure dropped to one in five for respondents with more than 21 years\u2019 experience. One in 10 said they had directly felt pressure \u201cto compromise ethical standards or violate the law\u201d. Nearly half said law enforcement and regulatory authorities were ineffective \u201cin detecting, investigating and prosecuting securities violations\u201d. \u201cMost concerning, is the proliferation of secrecy policies and agreements that attempt to silence reports of wrongdoing and obstruct an individual\u2019s fundamental right to freely engage with her government,\u201d noted authors Ann Tenbrunsel, an associate professor at University of Notre Dame, and Jordan Thomas, chairman of Labaton Sucharow\u2019s whistleblower representation practice. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US\u2019s top financial regulator, and others have been trying to encourage whistleblowing. Dodd-Frank financial regulations, enacted in 2010, set out rules to pay whistleblowers between 10% to 30% of the money collected in any case where their information results in more than $1m in penalties. But the survey found that while the majority of industry professionals (89%) would report misconduct given incentives and protections such as those offered by the SEC whistleblower programme, 37% of respondents were still unaware of the SEC\u2019s programme. More worryingly, 28% of respondents earning $500,000 or more a year said their company\u2019s confidentiality policies and procedures barred the reporting of potential illegal or unethical activities directly to law enforcement or regulatory authorities. A quarter of respondents earning $500,000 or more have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities. Some 19% of respondents said it was likely that their employer would retaliate if they were to report wrongdoing. That figure jumped to 24% for respondents from the UK. The real picture may be worse than the report paints, conclude the authors. \u201cWe recognize that respondents may sometimes be unwilling to reckon with and divulge personal truths \u2013 especially negative ones \u2013 and it is probable that respondents\u2019 views about their own companies are understated.\u201d Respondents\u2019 views of their competitors rather than themselves \u201cmay in fact represent the most accurate snapshot of industry reality\u201d, they reported. \u201cSo we are alarmed to report that nearly half (47%) of all respondents find it likely that their competitors have engaged in illegal or unethical activity in order to gain an edge in the market. This represents a spike from 39% in 2012. This figure jumps to 51% for individuals earning $500,000 or more per year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, who has died aged 86, won a place in history after a long and worthy career as a high-class economist and first-rate banker of the old school, when banking was banking. As the first president of the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the European Central Bank, from 1993 to 1997, he was \u201cpresent at the creation\u201d and charged with making the best of an ambitious economic financial architectural project that lacked the political superstructure he knew would be needed for permanent success. Later, so concerned was Lamfalussy about the dangers inherent in the kind of globalised free-for-all that afflicted financial markets and wider society during and after the crash, that he wrote a number of influential books and articles on the subject, continuing long after he had retired. The British became aware of Lamfalussy way back in the early 1960s, when, fascinated as he was by the development of post-1945 Europe, he produced a significant work entitled The United Kingdom and the Six: An Essay on Economic Growth in Western Europe (1963). This was when the Common Market, as it was then known, consisted of only six members, and Britain was part of the rival grouping, the European Free Trade Area, consisting of seven members. The joke at the time was that Europe was \u201cat sixes and sevens\u201d and Lamfalussy, who had been a research student at Nuffield College, Oxford, in the 1950s, became intrigued by the UK establishment\u2019s concerns about Britain\u2019s slow rate of growth vis-a-vis its continental neighbours. This led to the various UK applications to join what was then the European Economic Community, two of which were turned down with a decisive \u201cnon\u201d by the French president, Charles de Gaulle. The fashionable concern these days about the British economy is its poor productivity. This was also one of Lamfalussy\u2019s concerns at the time of his prescient book. In the jargon, he was especially worried about Britain\u2019s \u201ccapital/output ratio\u201d. His stint in Britain constituted an interval in his long-term residence in Belgium, to where he had escaped in 1949 from communist Hungary. He was born in Kapuvar, and grew up in Lenti, where his father was a forestry engineer. In Belgium, he undertook economic studies at Louvain University and enjoyed a successful career at the Banque de Bruxelles, before being recruited to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in 1976 \u2013 the official institution known as \u201cthe central bankers\u2019 bank\u201d, where the leading central bankers of the world convene most months. Lamfalussy rose at the BIS from being chief economist to general manager. He tried to use the bank\u2019s annual report to express his views, and thus allowed the phrase \u201ceconomic experiment\u201d to pass into print as the bank\u2019s comment on Thatcherism. In addition to being highly respected by his peers, he was approachable to journalists and very popular for his good-humoured and incisive analysis. Like so many of his ilk, he spoke several languages, and had perfect English. His role at the BIS made him a natural candidate for the Delors committee of central bankers, who were charged with producing a route map to European monetary union, should political leaders decide finally to go ahead with it. The project had been in the air for decades, and was given some impetus by the formation of the single market in 1986. The Delors committee sat in 1988-89, and reported on options in April 1989. What gave the project decisive impetus was the reaction of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France to the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year, and their desire to tie down the subsequently reunited Germany in a European monetary union. It was very clear to Lamfalussy that the construction of a monetary union without political union was like putting the cart before the horse. He did his best, and operated skilfully, loving his close relationship with Kohl and his exposure to raw politics after a lifetime as a technocrat. And his technocratic skills were vital. But politics triumphed over his well-founded doubts as to whether certain countries\u2019 economies were strong enough to join the single currency. Lamfalussy, who had been made a baron by the Belgian king in 1993, refused to be considered for the subsequent role of first president of the European Central Bank. However, he maintained an interest in financial regulation in semi-retirement, describing, not long before the financial crisis, \u201cthe current regulatory system\u201d as \u201ca remarkable cocktail of Kafkaesque inefficiency that serves no one\u201d. He is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie Cochard, whom he married in 1957, and their sons Christopher and J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and daughters Isabelle and Laurence. \u2022 Alexandre Lamfalussy, economist, born 26 April 1929; died 9 May 2015 \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2015 to correct a reference to Alexandre Lamfalussy\u2019s children.",

The FTSE 100 is currently up 24.02 points at 6992.89 having climbed as high as 7011, buoyed by some positive results, hopes of progress in Greece\u2019s financial crisis talks, comments by a US Federal Reserve member again playing down imminent interest rate rises, and Benoit Coeure of the European Central Bank saying it plans to increase bond purchases in May and June as part of its QE programme. As expected the UK consumer prices index fell by 0.1% in April, the first negative reading since March 1960. Land Securities is leading the way, up 33p at \u00a313.44 as the property group - developer of the Walkie Talkie skyscraper - raised its dividend by 3.7%. A rise in demand for commercial property helped lift its net asset value by 27.6% to \u00a312.93. Analyst Alison Watson said: Very strong results, with a 6% net asset value beat. Net asset value growth accelerated to 27.6% year on year, ahead of British Land\u2019s 20.5% reported last week.

      "bodyText": "Paragon increased lending to private landlords by almost two-thirds in the first half of the specialist mortgage lender\u2019s financial year as the buy-to-let boom continued. The company said new buy-to-let mortgages rose 65.7% to \u00a3446m in the six months to the end of March. Paragon\u2019s so-called pipeline of new loans awaiting completion more than doubled to \u00a3701m from \u00a3348m. Profit before tax, excluding changes in the value of hedging arrangements, increased by 10.4% to a record \u00a363.9m. The company increased its interim dividend by 20% to 3.6p a share. Paragon was Britain\u2019s biggest buy-to-let lender before the credit crunch. It stopped lending for two years after the crisis reached its peak in October 2008 but sprang back to life in 2010 to capitalise on demand from professional landlords. With interest rates at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years and rents rising, many of those able to borrow have turned to property investment for an income. Those who stayed in the market when property prices fell during the crisis have so far been rewarded. Returns on buy-to-let property have outstripped shares, bonds and cash since the market took off in 1996, earning returns of almost 1,400%. Nigel Terrington, Paragon\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThese results demonstrate how far Paragon has progressed in recent years as one of the UK\u2019s leading specialist lenders. Considerable growth in buy-to-let lending volumes and strong momentum into the second half of the year, complemented by the launch of a number of additional products, have significantly enhanced the group\u2019s franchise.\u201d Some economists have warned that Britain is in the middle of a property bubble that could burst when interest rates rise. The Bank of England warned a year ago that house prices could be heading for a crash in a rerun of previous booms and busts. Paragon said provisions for loans at risk of non-payment more than halved to \u00a33.5m from \u00a37.5m a year earlier as new cases of loan arrears fell and customers made payments that were overdue. Rising house prices also protected existing borrowers from defaulting on their mortgages. \u201cThe loan books continue to be carefully managed and the credit performance of the buy-to-let book remains exemplary,\u201d Paragon said. Many landlords who bought property before the financial crisis have mortgages that track the Bank of England\u2019s base rate. As a result, their costs have plunged since rates were cut to 0.5% in 2009. Retirees with greater freedom to spend their pension pot under the government\u2019s reforms also have the option of putting some of their money into property.",

    "webTitle": "Tony Abbott backs away from iron ore inquiry after lobbying by BHP and Rio", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott appears to have backed away from a government-supported inquiry into the iron ore market after a backlash from mining giants and some cabinet colleagues. Last Friday the prime minister said \u201cI think we do need an inquiry,\u201d and on Monday he said: \u201cI think it is important to get to the facts and an inquiry may well be a very good way of doing that.\u201d But in the wake of a lobbying effort by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto the prime minister said on Tuesday: \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t made any decision to have an inquiry \u2026 the last thing this government would ever want to do is interfere in a free market like the iron ore market.\u201d Distancing himself from the proposal, Abbott emphasised that the independent senator Nick Xenophon was the one who suggested an inquiry. The government was considering backing an inquiry headed by a government member as an alternative to Xenophon\u2019s original proposal, but the idea triggered cabinet divisions. The industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, who opposes the idea, said six times during an interview on Tuesday morning that a decision had not been made. Macfarlane said the government did not want to regulate the iron ore market and that it was the job of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to examine claims. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken pretty regularly with the prime minister in the last two days and I can tell you no decision has been made to have an inquiry,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s AM program on Tuesday. But the environment minister, Greg Hunt, pointed to the collapse in iron ore prices and suggested it was worthwhile to examine actions \u201cin the policy space to remove regulatory barriers which may be prohibiting or preventing efficiencies\u201d. \u201cA parliamentary inquiry also allows us to look at long-term government policy settings,\u201d Hunt told ABC Radio National on Monday. \u201cClearly the prime minister has indicated a desire to head down that path, so you would presume that\u2019s precisely where we are heading and there\u2019s very broad support for that. The details need to be worked through.\u201d The inquiry push was championed by the chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, Andrew Forrest, who has accused Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton of increasing iron ore production to reduce prices and damage smaller competitors. Rio Tinto and BHP have rejected this criticism and have been lobbying all parties against backing the inquiry, arguing such a review would send a bad signal to Australia\u2019s trading partners about potential government intervention in the market. On Tuesday, Abbott sounded cooler on the idea of an inquiry than he had in other media appearances over the past few days. The prime minister said while it was important to gather facts, the government would not interfere in the market. \u201cObviously we believe in the free market,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t made any decision to have an inquiry. This was something that Nick Xenophon was talking about last week. \u201cThe last thing we would want is a one-sided inquiry which degenerates into a witch-hunt against some of our best companies ... The last thing this government would ever want to do is interfere with a free market like the iron ore market.\u201d Abbott praised BHP, Rio and Fortescue as \u201cterrific Australian businesses\u201d that had flourished in a competitive free market \u201cand long may that be the case\u201d. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government was \u201cin a world of pain on this iron ore inquiry because they\u2019re sending out mixed messages\u201d and had \u201clet this debate run on far too long\u201d. The chief of BHP Billiton, Andrew Mackenzie, said an inquiry \u201cwould be an amazing gift to our major competitor Brazil\u201d, which was currently hosting a visit from the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang. China could be persuaded to increase investments in Brazil at the expense of Australia, he said. \u201cNot all inquiries are bad because they can draw people onto the same page, create transparency and trust, but this is a ridiculous waste of taxpayers\u2019 money on providing a basic economics course on supply and demand,\u201d Mackenzie told RN Breakfast on Tuesday. \u201cIt is something that will be an additional burden on the backs of business, distract us from growing profitability and paying more tax. It\u2019s red tape pure and simple. \u201cIt comes at a very bad moment, it sends a terrible signal to our customers and it flies in the face of the commitments that we have made at the highest level in places like China, Japan and Korea that they can count on secure supply from us at fair prices.\u201d In arguing for an inquiry, Forrest said it was no longer a free market but a distorted market. To support his argument that the big miners were flooding the market, Forrest pointed to a comment by the BHP Billiton iron ore division chief executive Jimmy Wilson in October 2014 that \u201cdemand side in this business still remains good but what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re oversupplying at the moment and we\u2019ll oversupply in the medium term\u201d. But Mackenzie said Wilson \u201cwas not commenting on us\u201d but was \u201ccommenting on the whole market\u201d and was repeating a point made about four years ago. \u201cSince 2006 we have not increased our market share. It still sits globally at 17%,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cMost of those other small suppliers have substantially increased their market share \u2013 good on them \u2013 because they were able to do that at higher prices but they were the sorts of investments that our company and our shareholders would never have made because we knew they weren\u2019t sustainable in the long term. There was a once-in-a-generation spike in price caused by the massive urbanisation of China that was always going to peter out.\u201d The treasurer, Joe Hockey, who spoke to Xenophon last week and persuaded him to delay his attempt to launch an inquiry, said the Xenophon-initiated probe \u201cwas going to turn into some kind of star chamber by [Labor senator] Sam Dastyari\u201d. \u201cFrom our perspective, we\u2019ll speak to the relevant parties,\u201d Hockey told ABC Radio in Adelaide on Tuesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any final decision.\u201d Asked what would be the point of an inquiry if it did not lead to action at the end, Hockey said it was \u201cnot an unreasonable point\u201d and the government was \u201cconsulting with all the parties\u201d. On Adelaide radio station FiveAA, Hockey said his priority was the budget, describing the iron ore issue as \u201cnot the main game\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d love to have iron ore prices higher but the market\u2019s the market,\u201d he said, referring to the flow-on impacts of a low price on government revenue.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Abbott appears to have backed away from a government-supported inquiry into the iron ore market after a backlash from mining giants and some cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>Last Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/15/tony-abbott-backs-inquiry-into-whether-miners-are-driving-down-iron-ore-price\">the prime minister said</a> \u201cI think we do need an inquiry,\u201d and on Monday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/18/tony-abbott-says-iron-ore-inquiry-must-not-become-a-witch-hunt\">he said</a>: \u201cI think it is important to get to the facts and an inquiry may well be a very good way of doing that.\u201d </p> <p>But in the wake of a lobbying effort by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto the prime minister said on Tuesday: \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t made any decision to have an inquiry \u2026 the last thing this government would ever want to do is interfere in a free market like the iron ore market.\u201d</p> <p>Distancing himself from the proposal, Abbott emphasised that the independent senator Nick Xenophon was the one who suggested an inquiry.</p> <p>The government was considering backing an inquiry headed by a government member as an alternative to Xenophon\u2019s original proposal, but the idea triggered cabinet divisions.</p> <p>The industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, who opposes the idea, said six times during an interview on Tuesday morning that a decision had not been made.</p> <p>Macfarlane said the government did not want to regulate the iron ore market and that it was the job of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to examine claims.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken pretty regularly with the prime minister in the last two days and I can tell you no decision has been made to have an inquiry,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s AM program on Tuesday.</p> <p>But the environment minister, Greg Hunt, pointed to the collapse in iron ore prices and suggested it was worthwhile to examine actions \u201cin the policy space to remove regulatory barriers which may be prohibiting or preventing efficiencies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA parliamentary inquiry also allows us to look at long-term government policy settings,\u201d Hunt told ABC Radio National on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cClearly the prime minister has indicated a desire to head down that path, so you would presume that\u2019s precisely where we are heading and there\u2019s very broad support for that. The details need to be worked through.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry push was championed by the chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, Andrew Forrest, who has accused Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton of increasing iron ore production to reduce prices and damage smaller competitors.</p> <p>Rio Tinto and BHP have rejected this criticism and have been lobbying all parties against backing the inquiry, arguing such a review would send a bad signal to Australia\u2019s trading partners about potential government intervention in the market.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Abbott sounded cooler on the idea of an inquiry than he had in other media appearances over the past few days. The prime minister said while it was important to gather facts, the government would not interfere in the market.<br></p> <p>\u201cObviously we believe in the free market,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>\u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t made any decision to have an inquiry. This was something that Nick Xenophon was talking about last week.</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing we would want is a one-sided inquiry which degenerates into a witch-hunt against some of our best companies ... The last thing this government would ever want to do is interfere with a free market like the iron ore market.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott praised BHP, Rio and Fortescue as \u201cterrific Australian businesses\u201d that had flourished in a competitive free market \u201cand long may that be the case\u201d.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government was \u201cin a world of pain on this iron ore inquiry because they\u2019re sending out mixed messages\u201d and had \u201clet this debate run on far too long\u201d.</p> <p>The chief of BHP Billiton, Andrew Mackenzie, said an inquiry \u201cwould be an amazing gift to our major competitor Brazil\u201d, which was currently hosting a visit from the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang. China could be persuaded to increase investments in Brazil at the expense of Australia, he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cNot all inquiries are bad because they can draw people onto the same page, create transparency and trust, but this is a ridiculous waste of taxpayers\u2019 money on providing a basic economics course on supply and demand,\u201d Mackenzie told RN Breakfast on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is something that will be an additional burden on the backs of business, distract us from growing profitability and paying more tax.
