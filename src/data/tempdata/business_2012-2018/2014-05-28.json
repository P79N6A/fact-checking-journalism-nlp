      "bodyText": "The chances of an increase in interest rates before the end of 2014 moved a significant step closer on Wednesday night when one of the Bank of England's key policymakers said a rise in the cost of borrowing should happen \"sooner rather than later\". In a sign that Threadneedle Street's unanimous line on keeping interest rates at 0.5% is at risk of breaking down, monetary policy committee (MPC) member Martin Weale said too long a delay would eventually mean sharper and more painful tightening of policy. \"If you want to have baby steps you do have to start sooner,\" he told the Financial Times. \"The question is: how close are we getting to 'soon'? Of course we can never be sure, but the economy \u2026 has sustained fairly rapid growth in demand. \"So I'm having to ask the question \u2013 and the answer is less definite than it was six months ago \u2013 'where do I think the interest rate should be at the moment?'\" The Bank has held interest rates at 0.5% \u2013 their lowest on record \u2013 for more than five years and until now the City has expected no change in borrowing costs until the first half of 2015. But Weale's comments are likely to prompt speculation that faster-than-expected growth and evidence of bubble-like conditions in London's property market will lead to the Bank moving during the autumn. Weale \u2013 one of the four independently appointed MPC members \u2013 said he saw no immediate need for a rate rise but said the Bank should not wait too long if it wanted to avoid a sudden lurch upwards. Weale said he thought \"we can wait a bit longer. How long that 'bit longer' will be I'm not sure, but the best judgment I can have is that it's not so urgent it needs doing now.\" The first hints that the MPC was starting to think about higher interest rates came last week, when the release of the minutes from the committee's May meeting recorded that some members thought the decision to keep policy unchanged was becoming more balanced. Weale confirmed he was one of the members who held this view and markets will now be looking to see if his tougher line is shared by any other members of the MPC. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, has sought to reassure mortgage payers and businesses that there will be no aggressive tightening of policy even when rates do start to rise. Carney thinks the Bank's financial policy committee has specific tools that can cool down the property market and that dearer borrowing costs should only be used as a last resort. The Bank's most recent quarterly inflation report, released earlier this month, said there was still slack in the economy left after the deep recession of 2008-09 and that until this was used up there was no need to tighten policy. The report said that most members of the MPC thought the spare capacity amounted to between 1% and 1.5% of gross domestic product. Weale said in March that he thought the slack in the economy was only 0.9% of GDP and that it was now less than that as a result of the continued growth in the economy. \"I wouldn't say that 0.9% had gone down to 0.7% or 0.6% but I think it's fair to say there is less capacity than there was on the basis of the figures I looked at,\" he said. \"What I'm increasingly going to have to do as more capacity is used up is balance off my sense of the risk of waiting too long versus acting too soon. \"I very much can see risks both ways and 'becoming more balanced' means an increasing sense of having to balance and judge those risks.\" Central banks around the world have held interest rates at emergency levels since the financial and economic crisis but Weale's remarks will lead to market expectations that Threadneedle Street will be the first to start edging them back upwards. With the eurozone suffering from weak growth and facing the risk of deflation, the European Central Bank is likely to cut interest rates next week, while the US Federal Reserve has stressed that it is no hurry to increase borrowing costs. Attention in the City on Thursday will be focused on what Weale's comments do to the value of sterling. The prospect of higher UK interest rates could lead to a stronger pound.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An extra $2bn was injected into the battle for global control of Botox on Wednesday when the drugs firm attempting to take over the maker of the anti-ageing treatment sold off an array of wrinkle fillers to give it the financial firepower to raise its offer to nearly $50bn. The Canadian-based company Valeant raised $1.4bn by selling the North American rights to a range of cosmetic and medical skin fillers to Nestl\u00e9, the Swiss firm famous for Nescaf\u00e9 and KitKats, and immediately put the money into its offer for Allergan, raising its bid to $49.4bn (\u00a336.2bn). The Californian Botox maker had rejected the previous surprise $47bn offer from Valeant and the activist investor Bill Ackman in April. Nestl\u00e9, with sales under pressure in its traditional food business, moved deeper into healthcare in February by taking over the Galderma dermatology joint venture it had with L'Or\u00e9al, and hinted at the time that more deals would follow. Galderma will form the basis of a new division known as Nestl\u00e9 Skin Health, with brands ranging from prescription drugs to over-the-counter soaps and sunscreen. The world's biggest food company gets the rights in the US and Canada to sell Restylane, Perlane and Emervel, injectable gels used to smooth away wrinkles or plump up lips, and Dysport, an injectable wrinkle relaxer similar to Botox. It will also get rights to Sculptra, an anti-ageing facial injection that replaces lost collagen, for cosmetic and medical use. Galderma already sells these products outside the US and Canada. Allergan is a tempting target \u2013 sales are projected to grow every year to reach $9bn in 2018, up from $6.3bn last year, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg \u2013 with Botox the jewel in the crown. The Botox market in the US \u2013 the biggest facial aesthetics market in the world \u2013 is forecast to double in only five years, from $2.5bn in 2013 to $4.7bn in 2018, according to analysts from the Swiss bank Vontobel, who cited data from GlobalData: Facial Aesthetics. Allergan's Botox is a bestseller in US beauty clinics \u2013 taking effect in just five to 10 minutes, with the results lasting three to 10 months \u2013 and accounts for more than three-quarters of the global market in the botulinum toxin from which the product is derived. In Britain, the Botox clinic that received a \u00a3250,000 investment from Lord Sugar as the winner of last year's The Apprentice gives the anti-ageing injections for between \u00a3199 and \u00a3350. The latest move in the takeover battle came a day after Allergan went on the offensive and sought to discredit Valeant by raising questions about its business model and the true value of its stock. The majority of its takeover offer is in shares, but Wednesday's deal helped it raise the cash component of the offer by $10 a share to $58.30. The higher offer values Allergan at $166.16 a share, up from $153 a share, but this is still well short of the $180-200 a share investors are said to be looking for. Valeant's skin fillers sale also removes a potential anti-trust hurdle to its proposed takeover of Allergan. Botox was first approved in 1989 to treat eye muscle disorders. It is a purified protein that paralyses muscles under the skin and blocks overactive nerve impulses that trigger excessive muscle contractions. As well as beating frown lines it is used to treat medical conditions including chronic migraine, uncontrollable blinking, severe sweating and overactive bladder. Citing its increasing use for migraine and bladder problems, Mike King, director of the market intelligence firm Companies and Markets, is forecasting continued double-digit growth for the global market. The Swiss group's chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said the deal had given Nestl\u00e9 strategic assets to extend its activities in specialised, medical skin treatments. \"This move will reinforce Galderma's leading position in the industry when it becomes Nestl\u00e9 Skin Health by allowing it to complete its geographic footprint for its strong portfolio of brands and leading medical solutions globally.\"",

    "webTitle": "Long-serving Co-operative Group board member mourns year of disaster", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It has been a tumultuous year for Ben Reid, chief executive of Britain's biggest independent retail co-operative. His own Midcounties society has become the first independent co-op to ring up \u00a31bn in sales, but, as the longest-serving member on the Co-operative Group's board, he has been in the thick of the crisis threatening to engulf Britain's biggest mutual group. \"I'm very saddened. The stress levels were massive,\" Reid says at Midcounties' headquarters near Leamington Spa. \"The value we have lost we inherited from our forebears. I don't think they would be very happy with us.\" Since April last year when the group's then wholly-owned bank pulled out of a deal to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches, the future of the entire 170-year-old group has come under threat from a string of scandals. A year on, it has reported a \u00a32.5bn loss for 2013 and relinquished all but 20% of the troubled bank, once a flagship business. Reid quit as a director of the group last week after the society's annual meeting voted unanimously for a modified version of sweeping governance reforms that will see the current board scrapped. Under proposals from City veteran Lord Myners, co-operative activists on the board, including a plumber, a nurse and a tax official, will be replaced by business people to chart a coherent strategy. But Reid does not accept some of Myners' more pointed remarks about the board, such as that they did not understand the difference between a debit and a credit and spent too much time talking about fairtrade bananas. \"How rude is that? I don't know anyone who talks about a debit and a credit any more. It's not the case that people didn't understand what was income and expenditure. I'm not asking them to do a set of accounts. They are presented with management information and understand the numbers. But can they effectively marshal an argument to deflect a dominant chief executive? That is a different matter altogether.\" Reid is referring to former chief executive Peter Marks, and agrees with Myners that the board was not equipped to challenge Marks as he expanded the group with the acquisitions of supermarket group Somerfield and Britannia Building Society \u2013 deals which Myners said wasted billions of pounds. Reid says he and Marks had different values and clashed several times: \"When Peter Marks took over six or seven years ago, the group changed its complexion. Peter was a capitalist. He was more about going forward than building a co-operative model.\" Euan Sutherland, the chief executive appointed from outside the group a year ago, also picked too many fights before walking out and branding the group ungovernable in March, Reid says. \"Sometimes you have got to go with the grain. He must have thought he had no choice but he wasn't taking the people with him.\" But as the co-operative movement's talisman society approached meltdown, Reid was pushed into a public spat with Myners over the board shake-up. The combative former City minister suggested Reid had threatened to block his reforms from the outset by wielding influence over more than 20% of votes controlled by the independent societies, and questioned why Reid himself was on the group board after having sat on the audit committee of the ill-fated bank until October last year. Reid seems baffled by the accusations: \"I think a lot of what Myners said made sense, but I wish he had used a different tone of voice and been more respectful to people who had given up a lot of time and effort, even if he thought some of it was misplaced. \"At no point was I trying to block him. I said you need to take account of our views and that it can't be one person, one vote across the whole piece because what does that leave for the independent societies? That has got turned into me blocking him.\" The two men have spoken since and Myners' final report made it clear the independent societies were not against the reforms, Reid says: \"We could have had those conversations in private [before]. I don't understand why this was played out as it was.\" Reid has worked in co-operatives for 33 years, starting with the small Ilkestone society. But he wasn't born into the movement, starting off as an accountant who wanted to get some retail experience. \"I don't know my mother's divi number,\" he says. But his attitude changed. \"I discovered a philosophy that I am happy to run my life by \u2013 that we are better together. I've turned from a dark-suited accountant into a co-operative person.\" But as the longest-serving businessman on the board should Reid have stood up to Marks? \"I don't know if I could have done more. If the mood in the boardroom isn't to challenge a decision, what can you do? I don't think anybody didn't know I was unhappy at times.\" A board built along the lines proposed by Myners would have done more to rein in Marks, Reid adds. \"Do I think we should have been stronger? Yes I do.\" Reid says everyone involved must share responsibility for the group's woes but he thinks Marks, who has kept a low profile since retiring a year ago, has got off lightly: \"It's interesting that his tenure hasn't been examined a lot more. There is no doubt, if you met Peter, he was the driving force over that period.\" But the biggest reputational trashing from the crisis was reserved for Paul Flowers, the Methodist minister and co-operative grandee who chaired the Co-op Bank from 2009 until last year. Flowers was filmed allegedly buying large quantities of illegal drugs and came in for ridicule when he told MPs the bank's assets were \u00a33bn when the correct figure was \u00a347bn. Reid insists Flowers was a sensible appointment as the bank struggled to bed down its then recent merger with Britannia under Neville Richardson, Britannia's former chief executive: \"He was the titular head of the bank to make sure we got the culture right, and on that basis I think the decision was right. Paul isn't responsible for the demise of the bank. Yes, he made a stupid mistake in the House of Commons that he will regret for the rest of his life.\" Alarm bells about the bank first rang in December 2012 when the Financial Services Authority instructed it to take a stricter approach to judging potential bad loans. But Reid says advisers told the board other lenders were in the same position and the bank ploughed on with its attempt to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. The deal was aborted in April last year, a month before a \u00a31.5bn capital gap was revealed in the bank's finances. \"What killed us was discovering the core Co-op Bank commercial loan book had a hole in it and from then on we were in trouble,\" Reid says. But Lloyds' decision to float 25% of the business under the TSB brand shows the deal would have been a good one, Reid says. The Co-op Group is looking for a new chief executive after Euan Sutherland's departure. Richard Pennycook, the finance director hired along with Sutherland, is standing in, but has said he does not want the job. Reid says the next boss needs to demonstrate co-operative values to get staff and customers believing again and not be a \"glitzy retailer\". He says Pennycook is talented and has adapted enough to be a strong candidate. Reid, who was not interviewed when Sutherland was appointed, appears to leave the door ajar for an approach. Most English football managers would manage the England team if they got the chance, and heading the group is the Co-op's equivalent, he says. But now he plans to return his attention back to Midshires. Revenues have suffered since because of the reflected damage from the group, he says. Reid is set to move out of the limelight \u2013 but the events of the last year will stay with the co-operative convert. \"I will ask for ever what more I could have done,\" he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 May",

His own Midcounties society has become the first independent co-op to ring up \u00a31bn in sales, but, as the longest-serving member on the Co-operative Group's board, he has been in the thick of the crisis threatening to engulf Britain's biggest mutual group.</p> <p>\"I'm very saddened.

      "bodyText": "Online retailer Asos is backing the expansion of a training programme designed to rebuild skills in the UK clothing manufacturing industry amid hopes that retailers are \"reshoring\" more orders. Fashion Enter, a manufacturer that first set up a workshop in London's Haringey in 2008 with just eight workers, now employs 84 people, including 48 machinists, and produces up to 7,500 garments a week for companies including Asos and Marks &amp; Spencer. It currently trains about 20 people every six weeks in basic stitching skills and is working with another 50 apprentices on more complex garment technology skills such as pattern cutting. But from next year, with the help of funding from Haringey council and the promise of more orders from Asos, it is planning to expand in order to train more than 1,000 people a year in a range of qualifications from stitching to the more technical aspects of clothing production including quality control, pattern cutting and fabric inspection. It is also aiming to extend production to 16,000 garments a week, as it gets more space to train new machinists beyond basic skills. Jenny Holloway, director of Fashion Enter, admits it is unlikely that all of her new trainees will find work within the UK fashion industry, but she says the UK is becoming more viable for clothing manufacture amid a new awareness of the total cost of sourcing abroad, from transport to paying hotel bills for staff. \"In fast fashion there is no substitute for turning a garment around in two or three weeks, as we can do,\" she says. Holloway adds that there are now 32 fashion factories in the area, and more planning to open, as demand for UK manufactured clothing hots up. Nick Walkley, chief executive of Haringey council, adds: \"It is easy to see regeneration as just about places like Hoxton with people drinking lattes, but it can also be about artisans making bread or garments at an international scale or single pieces. This area has a real opportunity to deliver quite large-scale employment.\"",

More regulation, higher taxes and help for the poorest were all approvingly suggested. Spontaneous applause erupted when Bill Clinton displayed a chart comparing rises in income under his presidency and that of Ronald Reagan which showed the poorest did far better under Mr Clinton.</p> <p>Third, it is far from obvious that the do-gooder elite setting the agenda had broad support from the merely very wealthy in the audience.

      "bodyText": "Time for a round-up. France's unemployment crisis has worsened, with the news that another 14,800 people joined the ranks of the jobseekers in April. The figures, which are worse than expected, put more pressure on president Hollande as he reels from last weekend's European Parliamentary elections. There are now 3,364,100 people out of work in mainland France -- a 0.4% increase compared with March, and 3.5% more than a year ago. Analysts warned that France's lack of growth means it is struggling to get to grips with unemployment. Earlier in the day, we also saw a surprise rise in German's unemployment total, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The rise was blamed on fewer companies having laid off staff last winter -- meaning Germany didn't see the usual spike in hiring once the weather improved (better for construction work and farming). Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, called for some perspective - saying the data does not mean that Germany is suffering from a slowdown in China or Russian sanctions: The reality is Germany will slow in coming months after a warmer winter artificially boosted growth to 0.8% in the first quarter of the year. A step down in the manufacturing sector was already under way as the economy goes through the normal process of being a developed economy, but so far the services sector and domestic demand have shown they are capable of preventing the destabilisation of a hard landing. In other news... Ian Hannam, once one of the City's most powerful bankers, has lost an appeal against charges of market abuse, and a \u00a3450,000 fine. German chancellor Angela Merkel has pipped Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to the title of World's Most Powerful Woman. US medical equipment firm Stryker has ruled out a takeover offer for Smith &amp; Nephew. But S&amp;N shares finished the day up 4.5%, having jumped 14% following reports that Stryker had engaged bankers to work on a deal. In M&amp;A news, Canada's Valeant raised its offer for Botox-maker Allergan Economic sentiment in the eurozone improved...but France lagged behind Nationwide predicted that London house prices might suffer a long-awaited correction this summer And Goldman Sachs has declared that Brazil is most likely to win the World Cup, with England tipped to flounder in the group stages. And fears are growing about the state of China's property market, after one of the country's leading developers warned that the Golden Age is over.... I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight! GW The FT's man in Paris, Hugh Carnegy writes: No wonder General Electric is under pressure to promise no French job losses as the US company battles to buy Alstom. adding: A glimmer of light in recent months has been a fall in youth unemployment numbers, but this trend also reversed slightly in April, with a 0.2 per cent rise in under-25s seeking work. The recent falls have also been largely due to government-backed make-work schemes. This chart from Bloomberg shows how French unemployment has been climbing since early 2008: (via German economics writer Holger Zschaepitz) Economist Bruno Ducoudre at the OFCE think-tank puts his finger on the fundamental problem with the French economy - it's not growing rapidly enough (with no growth at all in the January-March quarter). Ducoudre says: \"We need pretty strong quarterly growth of the order of 0.4 percent to get a significant decrease in unemployment, especially since companies are still overstaffed.\" This latest rise in French unemployment comes just a few days after the country's far-right National Front party won first place in the European Parliamentary elections. It's just over two years since Francois Hollande stormed to victory in the presidential election -- the last 24 months have been tough. Reuters sums it up: Hollande has watched his ratings crumble to record lows as he has struggled to live up to promises to wrestle down unemployment, which stood at 10.2% at the end of last year, according to the most recent figures. The Socialist leader, who is also having little success reviving the euro zone's second-biggest economy, has said he would not run for re-election in 2017 if unemployment does not fall by the end of his term. Analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly suggests Hollande urgently needs the European Central Bank to implement new stimulus measures: Just in: France's unemployment total has risen to a new record high, intensifying the pressure on embattled president Francois Hollande. The number of job seekers across mainland France rose by 14,800, or 0.4%, in April, pushing up the total to a new record of 3,364,100. That's worse than expected -- economists had forecasts a rise of around 5,500. That means the unemployment total is now 3.5% higher than a year ago. Hollande had promised to get the French jobless total falling before the end of 2013 - a target that is now four months overdue, and counting. With unemployment stable across the eurozone, and falling sharply in the UK over the last year, France is lagging behind. Data earlier this month showed that its economy failed to grow in the first three months of this year, while business surveys have shown companies are nervous about investing or hiring staff in the current climate. Europe's stock markets subsided to a limp finish this afternoon, and the surprise rise in German unemployment gets the blame: Jasper Lawler, Market Analyst at CMC Markets, says the German jobless data meant investors had no appetite for another rally. He says: The German unemployment rate remained the same but the economy lost 24k from the workforce. With business and investment sentiment potentially pointing to lower activity in Q2, today\u2019s unemployment data was another indication that the German economy is about to be dragged down by the poor growth in France and the periphery. And here's how things finished: FTSE 100: up 6 points at 6851 German DAX: down 1 points at 9939 French CAC: up 2 points at 4531. James Mackintosh of the Financial Times has written an interesting piece on yesterday's Inclusive Capitalism event in London (where Christine Lagarde and Mark Carney called for a more ethical and responsible financial system). It's easy to be cynical about an event \"organised by the Rothschilds, sponsored by the Rockefellers, and attended by Prince Charles. But Mackintosh reckons those presenting the problems or proposing solutions were clearly sincere, and many are becoming more progressive in their world view. He writes: I came away with three insights. First, the world\u2019s financial elite are growing seriously concerned about the danger that capitalism will become so unpopular that it may not be sustainable. If it has to be changed, they want to do the improving, not have a populist politician take the lead. Second, the elite seems to be swinging to the left. More regulation, higher taxes and help for the poorest were all approvingly suggested. Spontaneous applause erupted when Bill Clinton displayed a chart comparing rises in income under his presidency and that of Ronald Reagan which showed the poorest did far better under Mr Clinton. Third, it is far from obvious that the do-gooder elite setting the agenda had broad support from the merely very wealthy in the audience. No doubt some genuinely want change, and there is definitely a fear of excessive short-termism among the money managers present. But some were cynical in the extreme, he warns.... \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to talk about higher tax rates,\u201d said one senior executive who moved his business offshore to cut its tax bill. \u201cBut we have to do something to make [capitalism] look better.\u201d I\"m not sure it's as simply as that. At all. More here. A Reuters poll has found that a small majority of economists expect the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates in the second quarter of 2015. Nearly as many, though, think the first hike could come earlier. And many expect the first BoE hawks to start voting for a rate rise in August. Having lost his appeal over market abuse charges, it appears that Ian Hannam's original fine of \u00a3450,000 could be altered: The Financial Conduct Authority reports: The Tribunal has sought further submissions from Mr Hannam and the Authority on the issue of the appropriate penalty, before reaching a decision on that issue. In the Decision Notice, the Authority decided that it was appropriate to impose a financial penalty of \u00a3450,000. Sky News's Mark Kleinman reckons the fine could go up... Ian Hannam, once one of the City's most powerful and f\u00eated bankers, has lost an appeal against a \u00a3450,000 fine for market abuse. The Upper Tribunal has upheld the original decision two years ago that Hannam was guilty of two counts of market abuse. Hannam quit JP Morgan in 2012 after being fined for sending two emails disclosing information about his client, Heritage Oil, which hasn't yet been released to the public. Hannam denied that the details were tantamount to inside information -- in one, he said \"Tony [Buckingham, chief executive of Heritage] has just found oil and it is looking good\", a fortnight before an announcement. The Tribunal, wasn't convinced, saying: \u201cWe consider that it could never be in the proper course of a person\u2019s employment for him to disclose inside information to a third party, where he knows that his employer and client would not consent to the public disclosure of that information, unless he knows that the recipient is under a duty of confidentiality and that he knows that the recipient understands that to be the case.\u201d It was not part of the Authority\u2019s case that Mr Hannam deliberately set out to commit market abuse or that Mr Hannam lacked honesty or integrity, it added. And this chart shows how Smith &amp; Nephew shares soared on reports of a looming takeover offer from Stryker, only to crash back after Stryker declared it doesn't intent to bid. The green bars show the volume of shares traded -- there will be some burned fingers in the City... Excitement in the City after reports that medical equipment firm Smith &amp; Nephew faced a takeover bid from US rival Stryker. Shares in Smith &amp; Nephew surged 14% after a fastFT report that Stryker has hired bankers to work on a bid for S&amp;N, which would be a significant premium over its market capitalisation today. This sparked much drama -- the prospect of a new battle for a UK firm, just days after Pfizer was rebuffed by AstraZeneca. BUT Stryker has just issued a statement to the City, saying it doesn't plan to make an offer - effectively tying its own hands for the next six months. STATEMENT REGARDING SMITH &amp; NEPHEW PLC (\"SMITH &amp; NEPHEW\") Stryker Corporation (\"Stryker\") notes the recent speculation regarding a potential transaction involving Smith &amp; Nephew plc (\"Smith &amp; Nephew\") and recent movement in the share price of Smith &amp; Nephew. At the request of the UK Takeover Panel, Stryker confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Smith &amp; Nephew. Accordingly, Stryker is bound by the restrictions under Rule 2.8 of the UK Takeover Code (the \"Code\"). For the purposes of Rule 2.8 of the Code, Stryker reserves the right to announce or participate in an offer or possible offer for Smith &amp; Nephew and/or to take any other action which would otherwise be restricted under Rule 2.8 of the Code within 6 months after the date of this announcement in the circumstances described in note 2 to Rule 2.8 of the Code. Back on the big story of the morning -- the surprise rise in German unemployment, which has fuelled fears that the eurozone's largest economy may be feeling the impact of problems overseas. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, is confident that the rise in seasonally-adjusted joblessness does not spell \"economic Armageddon\". She writes: \"The German unemployment level increased for the first time in 6 months in April. Fears that the economic giant is buckling under the pressure of a slowing China and the backlash from Russian sanctions are growing, shown through declines in economic confidence and signs of a slowdown in manufacturing. \"However, the data needs to be read in context. The mere 24K increase in unemployment comes after six months of job gains and the unemployment rate remains at an all-time record low. The increase in unemployment wasn\u2019t concentrated in any of Germany\u2019s manufacturing heartland states but broadly distributed across the country, suggesting this isn\u2019t the result of Russian sanctions or a slowing China. \"The reality is Germany will slow in coming months after a warmer winter artificially boosted growth to 0.8% in the first quarter of the year. A step down in the manufacturing sector was already under way as the economy goes through the normal process of being a developed economy, but so far the services sector and domestic demand have shown they are capable of preventing the destabilisation of a hard landing.\" Daly concludes that we should give Germany some credit for its resilience, having \"pulled the rest of Europe out of the euro crisis, more or less unscathed\". Is the boom that ended in bust for Ireland's property market about to make a comeback? New data from the Irish Republic's Central Statistics Office (CSO) paints a picture of rising property prices, in Dublin at least. Henry McDonald reports: The CSO figures show that in April residential property prices in Dublin rose by 3.1%, bringing the annual increase over the financial year to a 17.7% spike in the cost of private houses in the capital. To put that in some perspective that is the fastest rate of growth in the city on a year to since October 2006 - the last year of the Celtic Tiger boom years. Outside of Dublin however, residential house prices fell by 0.3% in April Angela Merkel gave Europe a little taste of her power last night, incidentally - throwing up the race to become the next European Commission president by saying that a \"broader tableau\" of candidates should be considered. Bad news for Jean-Claude Juncker... German chancellor Angela Merkel has topped Forbes' list of the World's Most Powerful women, for the ninth time in 11 years. Merkel pipped Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve (and a new entry), to the head of a list that is dominated by key players in the worlds of politics, economics and business. I wonder if that was a tough call. Does running the Federal Reserve really give you less power than governing Germany - and if so, how much less?... Melinda Gates was third, followed by Brazilian president Dilma Roussef and then Christine Lagarde of the IMF. The full list is here. There's also plenty of speculation in Greece that prime minister Antonis Samaras is planning a cabinet reshuffle soon, after losing the EP elections to the opposition Syriza party. The Kathimerini newspaper reports that finance minister Yannis Stournaras has denied objecting to the prospect of being shuffled out of the government to run the Bank of Greece: Sources close to Stournaras denied reports that he had expressed displeasure about plans to remove him from his post as part of a cabinet reshuffle aimed at reviving the government\u2019s fortunes in the wake of mixed results. \u201cThe minister is going about his work as normal at the ministry,\u201d the sources told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (AMNA). Earlier reports had suggested that Stournaras would be sacrificed due to his unpopularity with voters. AMNA then published comments from Stournaras\u2019s aides that claimed the minister was unhappy at being the target of criticism from within the government. There are reports from Greece that the leader of the Democratic Left party (which quit the coalition last year) has resigned. Fotis Kouvelis is reported to have stepped down after a poor showing in last weekend's European Parliament elections. The euro has fallen to a new three-month low, weakened by the prospect of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates or announcing new stimulus programmes next week. It has lost more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.6751. Lunchtime reading: The World Cup is nearly upon us, which means Goldman Sachs has produced its traditional report into football's biggest jamboree. And the headline news is that Goldman's precious algorithms have concluded that this summer's contest is most likely to be won by (wait for it....) Brazil! But there's bad (although not exactly surprising) news for English fans - Roy Hodgson's boys are likely to be on the plane home after the group stages, with just over 1% chance of claiming the trophy. Goldman's sporting model predicts that Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Spain will reach the semifinals, and that Brazil will beat Argentina in the final, 3-1. It says: The most striking aspect of our model is how heavily it favours Brazil to win the World Cup, with Argentina and Germany next most favoured but much lower down in probability. Of course, it is hardly surprising that the most successful team in football history is favoured to win a World Cup at home. But the extent of the Brazilian advantage in our model is nevertheless striking. Our probability for an overall Brazil win is almost 50%. Here's Angela Monaghan's full story: Brazil to win 2014 World Cup, says Goldman Sachs The full report is online here. It's worth a look - as Goldman analysts around the globe have written economic pen-portraits of each country competing. And here's how the knockouts might play out.... The pharmaceutical deals keep coming....US-based Bedford Labs, which makes generic sterile injectable medicines, has just been gobbled up by London-based Hikma. The yield , or interest rate, on Spanish 10-year government debt has just slipped to a new all-time low of just 2.82%. Investors are driving up the value of the bonds (and thus lowering the yield) in expectation of new stimulus measures from the European Central Bank this week. A little while ago, ECB policymaker Yves Mersch said June's meeting could yield a combination of measures. Valeant's letter to Allergan, announcing its newly improved offer, is live on Business Insider. The battle for Botox has taken another twist this morning. Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant has \"substantially\" raised its offer for rival Allergan, which makes the Botox wrinkle treatment. It is now offering $58.30 in cash for each Allergan share, plus 0.83 of a Valeant share, up from $48.30 previously. Allergan had rejected the initial offer, made in April 22, as too low. As well as adding more cash to the pot, Valeant has promised to invest $400m in Allergan's Darpin operations (short for \"designed ankyrin repeat proteins\", or genetically engineered antibody mimetic proteins), and to keep the current Darpin workforce employed. In a letter, Valeant told Allergan that: Our revised offer is based on specific feedback we received in our discussions with shareholders. Earlier today, Valeant sold the rights to a range of skin filler and toxin products to Nestle for $1.4bn in cash, giving it the firepower to up its offer for Allergan. Growth in UK retail sales has slowed this month, after surging in April as Britons splurged over Easter. The CBI reported that 38% of retailers have sold more goods this month, while 22% sold less. This creates a net balance of +16, down from +30 in April. Shopkeepers are still upbeat, though - 43% of retailers expect sales volumes to increase next month, with 13% expecting them to decrease. While economic sentiment across the eurozone is now at a 34-month high, consumer confidence improved to a 79-month high in May. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight writes: Most business sectors saw sentiment improve in May after a widespread dip in April that appeared to partly reflect concerns over the Ukraine crisis in a number of countries, notably Germany. Both services and industrial companies reported a recent improvement in new business. Meanwhile consumer confidence improved to a 79-month high in May, as it was buoyed by improved optimism over the recent economic situation and outlook, and by reduced job concerns. Consumers\u2019 willingness to make purchases over the next 12 months rose to a four-year high in May (although the index was still below its long-term average) while their willingness to make purchases at present improved and was just below March\u2019s 45-month high. Most countries saw improvement in overall economic sentiment in May, including Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece. However, there was a dip in sentiment in France, which adds to the recent disappointing news there. The EC also reported an improvement in economic sentiment in Greece --Nordea Markets analyst Aurelija Augulyte shows that it's now overtaken France. Eurozone companies have grown more optimistic about economic prospects, according to the latest monthly survey by the European Commission. The EC's Economic Sentiment Indicator rose to 102.7 in the euro area, from 120.0 last month. Across the wider EU, the measure inched up by 0.2 percentage points to 106.5. Back in the UK, the Nationwide Building Society warned this morning that the London housing market is slowing. Prices may start to fall this summer, after surging strongly over the last year. Money editor Patrick Collinson reports: The London property market is heading for a 'natural correction' with the 'frenetic' pace of buying beginning to fade, according to the head of Britain's biggest building society. Graham Beale, chief executive of Nationwide building society, said: \"We could be seeing the early sign of a natural correction in the London housing market.\" He added that sales have begun to slacken in the capital, but did not predict a widespread slump. \"We are going from frenetic at the start of the year to merely very very busy.\" Full story: Nationwide says London housing market starting to slow down Frank-Juergen Weise, the head of German Labor Office, believes the country's employment sector remains healthy despite the seasonally-adjusted jobless total rising by the fastest amount since 2009. AP reports: Because the mild winter meant the loss of fewer seasonal jobs in previous months, Weise said the spring recovery slowed in May, but that \"overall the labor market is doing well.\" It's worth underlining that Germany's seasonally-adjusted, and unadjusted, jobless data paint quite different pictures. While the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate was flat at 6.7%, it actually dropped to 6.6% from 6.8% in raw terms. The underlying message seems to be that Germany's traditional springtime surge in employment was smaller than expected, partly because firms held onto more staff in the quieter winter months. The German government is blaming the surprise rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment on the mild winter. It argues that firms were able to keep staff on earlier this year, when they would otherwise have cut back. Thus, you don't get the traditional surge in hiring once the weather improves. Reuters has the details: German unemployment jumped unexpectedly in May by the largest amount in several years, a rise the Labour Office attributed to mild winter weather. The number of people out of work increased by 24,000 to 2.905 million, seasonally-adjusted data showed on Wednesday. The mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll had been for a drop of 15,000. The jobless rate was steady at 6.7 percent. Because of the mild winter, the Labour Office said that employers - notably in the construction sector - had not cut jobs at the usual rate in the early months of the year. As a result, there had not been the traditional ramp-up in employment in the spring. And remember, if you ignore seasonal variation, the jobless total did still fall.... JUST IN: The number of people unemployed in German has risen by the largest amount in five years - on a seasonally adjusted basis anyway. Germany's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.7% in May, well below the eurozone average of 11.8%, according to data just released by the country's Labour ministry. But the jobless total jumped unexpectedly. The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 24,000 this month to 2.905m. Economists had expected a fall of 15,000. If you ignore seasonal variation, the unadjusted jobless total dropped to 2.882 million this month, down from 2.943 million in April. But the unexpected rise in the seasonally adjusted measure (a better measure of the underlying health of the labour market) is a surprise: Here's some instant reaction: More to follow... We're running a poll on whether capitalism can be ethical, after the Bank of England governor warned last night that \"unchecked market fundamentalism\" risks destroying the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself. Can capitalism ever be ethical? The early voting shows most readers think it cannot.... Today's Asian stock market rally has pushed up the FTSE All-World equity index by another 0.1% today. That means it is barely 1% shy of its 2007 peak, flags up the FT's Jamie Chisholm. The gold price has hit a three and a half-month low this morning, trading at just $1,260 per ounce. That's the lowest since mid-February. Tuesday's encouraging economic data from America is hitting demand for safe-haven assets, as the rise in US consumer confidence suggests economic growth is picking up. Analysts also blamed data showing a drop in demand for gold in China. Chinese imports of gold from Hong Kong hit a 14-month low last month. Germany's DAX index has hit yet another record high at the start of trading in Frankfurt. The DAX jumped 18 points to 9958, as investors in Europe's largest economy remain upbeat about economic prospects. Other European markets are broadly flat in the opening minutes of trading. China Vanke's warning that the Golden Age of Chinese property is Over comes as the markets nervously await the latest house price figures for 100 Chinese cities, due this weekend. Marketwatch reckons they could show the market has deteriorated: China's property slump is deepening despite growing government efforts to give home sales a lift, adding to concerns over the health of the world's No. 2 economy. Cities ranging from Tianjin in the north to Nanning in the south--Ningbo lies in between--have eased government restrictions on home buying and lending for purchases in recent weeks. The central government is also helping, entreating banks this month to lend more. Authorities hope to reverse a downturn that has led to a 9.9% nationwide drop in housing sales by value in the first four months of the year, compared with a year earlier. Construction starts for housing have fallen 24.5% over the same period. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. Asian stock markets have continued to climb higher today, thanks to optimism over the state of the US economy and the prospect of the European Central Bank upping its fight against deflation next week. Stock markets in Asia have hit their highest levels in a year, as traders showed their appetite for risk, after watching the US S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high last night. Yesterday's jump in US consumer confidence, along with news of rising house prices and higher durable goods sales, cheered investors. As Mizuho Bank put it: \"The ongoing economic recovery is confirmed. Consumer confidence matched expectations.\" In Taiwan, the stock market has hit its highest level since January 2011. That might be enough to sent European shares a little higher, pushing the German DAX towards fresh record highs; perhaps the 10,000 point mark for the first time (it closed at 9940 last night). But cautious words from China's largest residential property sector are casting a pall over the markets. China Vanke's president, Yu Liang, told reporters that the days of rapid growth in China's real estate sector are over; adding to concerns that the Chinese property sector will stumble as Beijing stamps down on speculative investment and cheap credit. The Golden Age of the Chinese property sector is over, Yu said, adding: \"The white silver era has just begun.\" But as Reuters flags up, other property firms are voicing more serious fears. The chairman of office developer SOHO China warned last week: \"I think China's real estate is like the Titanic and it will soon hit an iceberg up front.\" One to watch...... I'll be tracking all the main events through the day -- including the latest French consumer confidence data and German unemployment figures this morning.....",

      "bodyText": "The soaring London property market is heading for a \"natural correction\" with a slight slowdown in sales already under way, according to Nationwide building society. Unveiling a big leap in profits at the mutual \u2013 partly a result of customers switching their accounts from the Co-operative Bank \u2013 the society's chief executive, Graham Beale, said: \"We could be seeing the early sign of a natural correction in the London housing market.\" He added that sales had begun to slacken in the capital, but did not predict a widespread slump: \"We are going from frenetic at the start of the year to merely very, very busy.\" According to Rightmove, a property website, asking prices for property in London have leapt by \u00a380,000 since the start of 2014 alone, and prices in the capital are 30% above their 2007 peak. Separate figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed that lending to home-owners in the capital was up 37% in the first three months of 2014 compared with the same period last year. London property developer Telford Homes reported a doubling in profits in the latest sign of surging demand for bricks and mortar in the capital. But the developer, which sells about one-third of its homes to foreign investors, played down fears of a housing bubble in London. It said the imbalance between demand and supply \"inevitably\" led to rising prices and would continue to underpin the market. Nationwide's caution about further price rises in London came as it revealed record pre-tax profits of \u00a3924m, nearly five times their lowest level in the depths of the financial crisis and significantly above the previous peak of \u00a3781m in 2008. The surge in profits comes after a 52% jump in net mortgage lending and a \u00a34.9bn increase in savings balances. Nationwide accounts for 10% of the UK mortgage market, and just over 12% of all savings balances. The society also revealed that 32% of its mortgage lending in 2014 was for house purchases in London, up from 30% the year before and just short of the total amount it lent in the north, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined. Over the year, Nationwide added a net 300,000 current accounts, bringing the total to 5.5m and making it a serious challenger to the traditional high street banks. It confirmed that Co-operative bank customers had been moving to Nationwide as an alternative mutual player, but refused to disclose precise figures. \"We are clearly seeing some Co-op customers coming over to Nationwide on the basis of our values and mutual stance,\" said Chris Rhodes, group retail director. Behind Nationwide's bumper profit figures lies a big increase in its 'net interest margin' \u2013 the gap between what it charges mortgage holders and what it pays out in interest to savers \u2013 which rose from 1.02% to 1.25%. Many householders coming off fixed-rate deals are paying more when they remortgage, while the government's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) has pushed down the interest rates the society needs to pay on savings to attract deposits. It also benefited as current account holders left more money in accounts paying little interest. \"The most significant drivers of our higher margin were maturing fixed mortgage deals re-pricing on to higher-margin products and lower retail funding costs, which reflect reduced demand across the market for retail savings, in part as a consequence of the availability of the FLS, and growth in our personal current account credit balances by approximately \u00a31.5bn over the course of the year,\" Nationwide said. The average loan-to-value for new mortgages rose to 73% from 71%, but the society said the quality of its loan book remained robust. The number of loans above 90% of the value of the property was 2.4% of its total loan book. The number of its customers in arrears of three months was 0.63% at the end of 2013, compared with 1.59% across the industry. Gross mortgage lending was up 31% to \u00a328.1bn, equal to 14.9% of all mortgage lending in the UK, with net lending ahead even more, at \u00a39.9bn, up 51%. Buy-to-let lending also surged to reach \u00a31.7bn. But it forecast that the growth in lending volumes in 2014 was likely to slow down, with net lending expected to be just under \u00a31bn a month this year. New affordability checks on borrowers had slowed down applications, it said, but had not resulted in lower lending volumes.",

He was thereby engaged in market abuse. His actions were not in the proper course of the exercise of his employment ...

It recommended: \"The authority might give consideration to making mandatory the keeping of a record of when and how a person has been made subject to confidentiality obligations and of precisely what he has been told. This is particularly so in the case of inside information in the context of a potential bidder in a corporate transaction. With such a record, the task of investigating potential dealing based on inside information would be more straightforward than without one\".</p>",

Hannam was fined \u00a3450,000 \u2013 although that decision is still under review and he could now face a tougher sanction. In dismissing Hannam's appeal on Wednesday, the upper tribunal of the tax and chancery chamber stated: \"Mr Hannam's actions in sending both the September email and the October email constituted behaviour falling within section 5 118(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. He was thereby engaged in market abuse. His actions were not in the proper course of the exercise of his employment ... The issue of the appropriate penalty to impose is to be dealt with on a later occasion\". Hannam's appeal had cited a defence that there were \"reasonable grounds for [the regulator] to be satisfied that [he] believed ... that his behaviour did not constitute market abuse, or took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid behaving in that way.\" After receiving the decision, the financier added: \"I am obviously disappointed that the tribunal has rejected the explanation as to why the two emails sent in the course of advising and assisting my client did not contravene the rules, but I do appreciate the full consideration that has been given to the issues. I am gratified that the tribunal has accepted that I was indeed acting only in the interests of my client and without any dishonest or ulterior motive\". The announcement completes Hannam's relegation down the City rankings, after he resigned as chairman of capital markets at JP Morgan in March 2012 to fight the case. Once considered one of the Square Mile's star bankers, his reputation has taken a second knock following the dissipation of the commodity sector boom. He is now perhaps best remembered for conceiving the disastrous acquisition of Indonesian mining rights by Bumi, a vehicle created by the banking scion Nat Rothschild, while Hannam also brought the Kazakh miner Kazakhmys to the London markets, only for the shares to subsequently slump and the company to drop out of the FTSE 100. In its judgement, the tribunal also suggested that the FSA's successor, the Financial Conduct Authority, might look at refining its rules. It recommended: \"The authority might give consideration to making mandatory the keeping of a record of when and how a person has been made subject to confidentiality obligations and of precisely what he has been told. This is particularly so in the case of inside information in the context of a potential bidder in a corporate transaction. With such a record, the task of investigating potential dealing based on inside information would be more straightforward than without one\".",

    "webTitle": "Serco wins contract to run Caledonian sleeper service", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Serco, the company that has been dogged by scandals from overcharging for prisoner tagging to allegations of sexual assault at an immigration detention centre, has been given the contract to run sleeper trains between London and the Highlands of Scotland. Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said Serco's bid for the franchise to run the much-loved Caledonian sleeper service from April next year \"reflected the Scottish government's objectives to transform this iconic Scottish rail service\". The huge outsourcing firm, which runs luxury train services in Australia , landed the deal with a promise to create hotel-style cabins with en suite bathrooms, as well as a top-notch dining service serving Scottish produce. The RMT rail union said Serco was \"a company with a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services\" and should never have been considered to run the service. Serco estimates that it will earn \u00a3800m from the 15-year deal, including \u00a3180m from franchise payments. The contract is a fillip for the outsourcing group, which has been dogged by scandals. It faces an investigation by MPs after it was forced this month to disclose a secret internal report revealing evidence that it failed to properly investigate a claim of repeated sexual assaults by one of its staff against a female resident at Yarl's Wood immigration detention centre. MPs on the public accounts committee had previously published a scathing report on its \"substandard\" GP out-of-hours service in Cornwall and it is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over tagging of prisoners. Serco's running of the NorthLink ferry service, connecting the Orkney and Shetland Islands to the mainland, has also come under fire after engine failure led to a temporary suspension of the \"lifeline\" service last year. The decision is a blow to its rival bidder, the Aberdeen-based First Group, which operates the service as part of a bigger contract to run ScotRail. Arriva also lost out to run the sleeper on the sleeper contract. The Scottish government decided to split the sleeper contract from the main ScotRail franchise after a recent review of transport policy. More than \u00a3100m will be spent on 72 \"state-of-the-art\" carriages for four trains, which will come on track in the summer of 2018. About \u00a360m will come from the Scottish government, which has promised trains that are \"emblematic of Scotland\". Serco said it would be spending about \u00a340m on trains under the terms of the franchise agreement. Serco chief executive Rupert Soames has been an outspoken critic of Scottish independence in his previous role at Aggreko, but the company said it has no plans to invoke the seven-year break clause in the event of a \"yes\" vote in September. The company said it had no plans to cut staff, while unions vowed \"fierce resistance\" in the event of threats to jobs and conditions. The sleeper service has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with 270,000 passengers a year taking the train, that links London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Fort William, Inverness and Aberdeen. Serco, which employs 120,000 people in more than 30 countries, has a vast transport business: it runs the Docklands Light Railway and the \"Boris\" bikes hire scheme in London and holds Britain's largest passenger rail franchise with Northern Rail in partnership with the Dutch company Abellio. Beyond the UK, it operates the Dubai metro system, as well as railway routes in India and Australia. The RMT rail union said it was deeply concerned about the decision to award the franchise to Serco. \"Quite frankly, with their appalling list of failures in the UK and globally they should never have even been considered as contenders for the Scottish sleeper service. The logical option of public ownership was not even looked at,\" said the RMT's acting general secretary Mick Cash. Manuel Cortes of the TSSA union said: \"This decision flies in the face of everything Alex Salmond has been saying about an independent, financially strong Scotland. He has taken the contract away from a Scots firm and handed it to an English based firm which will be given a \u00a360m subsidy to build new trains in Spain.\" Soames, who took up his post this month, said: \"I am delighted that we can use this unique blend of expertise to transform the iconic Caledonian sleeper into a modern, high-quality hospitality service to make Scotland proud. Serco has a very constructive relationship with many parts of Scottish government and already operates essential public transport and many other services.\" First Group said the sleeper service accounted for just 2% of First ScotRail's annual revenues and its medium-term targets were unchanged. It added that it was shortlisted for a number of other rail franchises with the aim of maintaining its earnings. The company found out last week it had lost out in the bid to run the Thameslink rail link, one of the UK's busiest commuter routes. \"We will continue to provide sleeper passengers with the best possible service until the new franchise commences, and will work closely with the new operator to ensure a seamless handover,\" said the First Group chief executive, Tim O'Toole. The ScotRail franchise is also up for renewal, with the winning bidder to be announced in the autumn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Growth in retail sales slowed unexpectedly in May, as shoppers stayed away from department stores and a slower rise in food sales dragged the sector down, according to the latest snapshot from the CBI. Job creation in retail came to standstill, internet sales rose at the slowest pace in almost a year and investment plans weakened, the business lobby group said. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said consumers were probably less willing to spend after splashing out over Easter, which fell in April this year. Despite the dip in performance in May, retailers were feeling more optimistic about sales prospects in the month ahead, with a slight pickup in employment also expected. Barry Williams, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel and Asda's chief merchandising officer for food, said: \"Retailers' predictions of further sales growth bore fruit this month. Although that growth was at a slower rate than expected, the fact we've seen a steady increase for six consecutive months is a sign we're heading towards sustainable growth and strengthening consumer optimism \u2013 and it's good to hear shopkeepers telling us they expect even stronger figures next month.\" According to the CBI survey, 38% of retailers reported a rise in sales volumes in May compared with a year ago, while 22% said they were down. The resulting balance of +16% was lower than April's +30%, and much weaker than the +35% predicted by economists. Archer said the retail sector remained healthy overall. \"The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment continues to rise and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation,\" he said. \"Elevated consumer confidence, markedly higher employment and a much improved housing market overall are all supportive to consumer spending.\"",

Although that growth was at a slower rate than expected, the fact we've seen a steady increase for six consecutive months is a sign we're heading towards sustainable growth and strengthening consumer optimism \u2013 and it's good to hear shopkeepers telling us they expect even stronger figures next month.\"</p> <p>According to the CBI survey, 38% of retailers reported a rise in sales volumes in May compared with a year ago, while 22% said they were down. The resulting balance of +16% was lower than April's +30%, and much weaker than the +35% predicted by economists.</p> <p>Archer said the retail sector remained healthy overall.</p> <p>\"The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment continues to rise and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Elevated consumer confidence, markedly higher employment and a much improved housing market overall are all supportive to consumer spending.\"</p>",

Telford Homes is the latest homebuilder to benefit from the mismatch between demand and supply in London, with Wednesday's announcement of bumper profits following spectacular results from Barratt, Bovis and Persimmon earlier in the year. The company, which is listed on London's junior Aim stock exchange, reported pre-tax profits of \u00a319.2m for the year to the end of March, compared to \u00a39m for the previous year. It expects its profits to double again by 2018, with cumulative pre-tax profits for the next four years set to exceed \u00a3120m. Telford said some of its properties were being snapped up just hours after going on the market, underscoring how homebuilders can profit from the scarcity of housing in the capital. \"The number of people who want to live in London continues to be far in excess of the supply of homes and this underpins the board's expectations of significant growth in output and profit levels over the next few years,\" the Telford Homes chairman, Andrew Wiseman, said in a statement to investors.

The developer, which sells around one third of its homes to foreign investors, played down fears of a housing bubble in the capital. It said the imbalance between demand and supply \"inevitably\" led to rising prices and was a \"fundamental issue\" that would continue to underpin the market. But it added that while mortgage finance was more available, lenders had not returned to the days of handing out high loan-to-value mortgages. \"Applications are still carefully policed and therefore the conditions today for securing finance remain very different to those in 2007.\"",

According to the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper, the city's health bureau has ordered local healthcare departments to carry out internal compliance investigations before the end of June and to report any kickbacks they had received. A health bureau memo mentioned by the newspaper report named Britain's AstraZeneca, America's Eli Lilly and Denmark's Novo Nordisk as companies suspected of making kickbacks.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Capitalism is at risk of destroying itself unless bankers realise they have an obligation to create a fairer society, the Bank of England governor has warned. Mark Carney said bankers had operated a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\" system. He questioned whether traders met ethical standards and said that those who failed to meet high professional standards should face ostracism. Speaking at a City conference, the Bank's governor warned that there was a growing sense that the basic social contract at the heart of capitalism was breaking down amid rising inequality. \"We simply cannot take the capitalist system, which produces such plenty and so many solutions, for granted. Prosperity requires not just investment in economic capital, but investment in social capital.\" In a strongly worded critique of City behaviour in the run-up to the financial crisis, Carney said market radicalism and light-touch regulation had eroded fair capitalism, while scandals such as the rigging of Libor markets had undermined trust in the financial system. \"Just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself. To counteract this tendency, individuals and their firms must have a sense of their responsibilities for the broader system.\" Carney told delegates at a conference on inclusive capitalism in London \u2013 which was attended by the former US president Bill Clinton \u2013 that big banks had operated in a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble\", with personal gain hotly pursued by bankers. \"All ideologies are prone to extremes. Capitalism loses its sense of moderation when the belief in the power of the market enters the realm of faith. In the decades prior to the crisis such radicalism came to dominate economic ideas and became a pattern of social behaviour.\" The governor added that policymakers and regulators in the UK and internationally were addressing ways of making the system fairer and of limiting the likelihood of a future financial crisis through reforms. But he stressed that there was a greater onus on banks and also bankers to take responsibility. Referring to changes afoot, after the scandals in fixed income, currency and commodity markets, he said: \"Such changes are vital but they cannot anticipate every contingency or discipline every miscreant. \"The scandals highlight a malaise in corners of finance that must be remedied. Many banks have rightly developed codes of ethics or business principles, but have all their traders absorbed their meaning? \"Consideration should be given to developing principles of fair markets, codes of conduct for specific markets, and even regulatory obligations within this framework. There should be clear consequences including professional ostracism for failing to meet these standards.\" He said G20 leaders and international regulators on the Financial Stability Board were working to resolve the issue of financial institutions that were \"too big to fail\", a problem which left taxpayers with a huge bill at the onset of the crisis in 2008. \"This is the year to complete that job,\" he said. \"Perhaps the most severe blow to public trust was the revelation that there were scores of too-big-to-fail institutions operating at the heart of finance. Bankers made enormous sums in the run-up to the crisis and were often well compensated after it hit. In turn, taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures.\" Carney said that ultra loose monetary in the UK had helped to prevent a lost generation of long-term unemployed, and improved long-term social mobility prospects. He added new powers and responsibility handed to the Bank by George Osborne should help to reduce incidence of financial crises. He said one of the lessons of the crisis was that compensation schemes that delivered large bonuses for short-term returns encouraged individuals to take on too much long-term risk. \"In short, the present was overvalued and the future heavily discounted.\"",

      "body": "<p>Capitalism is at risk of destroying itself unless bankers realise they have an obligation to create a fairer society, the Bank of England governor has warned.</p> <p>Mark Carney said bankers had operated a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\" system. He questioned whether traders met ethical standards and said that those who failed to meet high professional standards should face ostracism.</p> <p>Speaking at a City conference, the Bank's governor warned that there was a growing sense that the basic social contract at the heart of capitalism was breaking down amid rising inequality. \"We simply cannot take the capitalist system, which produces such plenty and so many solutions, for granted. Prosperity requires not just investment in economic capital, but investment in social capital.\"</p> <p>In a strongly worded critique of City behaviour in the run-up to the financial crisis, Carney said market radicalism and light-touch regulation had eroded fair capitalism, while scandals such as the rigging of Libor markets had undermined trust in the financial system.</p> <p>\"Just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself. To counteract this tendency, individuals and their firms must have a sense of their responsibilities for the broader system.\"</p> <p>Carney told delegates at a conference on inclusive capitalism in London \u2013 which was attended by the former US president Bill Clinton \u2013 that big banks had operated in a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble\", with personal gain hotly pursued by bankers.</p> <p>\"All ideologies are prone to extremes. Capitalism loses its sense of moderation when the belief in the power of the market enters the realm of faith. In the decades prior to the crisis such radicalism came to dominate economic ideas and became a pattern of social behaviour.\"</p> <p>The governor added that policymakers and regulators in the UK and internationally were addressing ways of making the system fairer and of limiting the likelihood of a future financial crisis through reforms.</p> <p>But he stressed that there was a greater onus on banks and also bankers to take responsibility. Referring to changes afoot, after the scandals in fixed income, currency and commodity markets, he said: \"Such changes are vital but they cannot anticipate every contingency or discipline every miscreant.</p> <p>\"The scandals highlight a malaise in corners of finance that must be remedied.

      "bodyText": "Britain's growing army of self-employed workers are typically worse off than employees but enjoy greater job satisfaction, according to a report today. The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) seeks to rebuff the theory that many people have been forced into working for themselves by a shrinking jobs market since the downturn, arguing instead that they chose to go it alone for greater flexibility and creative freedom. \"I think we have this new type of worker, at least some of the self-employed, that value different things at work, the softer benefits over the harder ones,\" said Benedict Dellot, author of the Salvation In A Start-Up report. The self-employed were also drawn to the potential savings on childcare and commuting, added Dellot, a senior researcher at RSA. The typical full-time self-employed worker earns \u00a374 less per week than a full-time employee and also tends to work longer hours, have less holiday leave and be at risk of social isolation, according to the RSA report in partnership with shopping website Etsy. But its survey of more than 1,000 microbusiness owners, suggested only one in four who started up in the recession said that escaping unemployment was a key motivating factor. Instead, a more common answer was to achieve greater freedom or \"make the most of a good idea\". It also found 84% claimed they were more satisfied in their working lives than they would have been in a conventional job. Respondents cited factors such as being able to live where they want and work around caring for older relatives or children. The RSA is calling for an urgent review of government policy on self-employment, which it predicts will continue to rise further from one in seven workers now. Its report explicitly disagreed with the trade unions group TUC, which says that pensioners, part-time workers and \"odd-jobbers\" have been the fastest-growing groups among the new self-employed workforce. Responding to the RSA's research, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Reports that look at the average self-employed person provide little insight into the reality of today's labour market. We can both celebrate the budding entrepreneur and object to the bogus self-employment of the building workers and internet delivery van drivers that are just as much part of the insecure exploited workforce as those on an abusive zero-hours contract.\" But the RSA said its analysis of the UK's official Labour Force Survey showed that the biggest increase in self-employment since 2008 has been in highly skilled professional occupations, up 35%. The numbers of micro-businesses was already rising before 2008, adding Dellot, questioning the link between the downturn and people working for themselves. \"The fundamental lesson from our research is that we need to learn to live with the self-employed,\" he said. \"Trade unions should be trying to support the self-employed rather than hark back to the days where everyone is employed by a large employer.\" A separate report today paints a brighter jobs outlook for graduates after years of high youth unemployment and cutbacks in recruitment drives by the big employers. Graduate vacancies were up 37% on the year in April as employer optimism picked up, according to the latest report from jobs search engine Adzuna. Several large graduate employers including PwC, Deloitte and Teach First are all currently advertising over 1,000 entry-level roles, it said. \"Despite an increase in entry-level vacancies, competition still remains fierce amongst the top graduate employers, with over 160 Class of 2013 graduates battling it out for places on the country's top grad schemes,\" said Andrew Hunter, Adzuna's co-founder. Nearly half of all graduate opportunities were in London and the South East, the report said.",
