      "bodyText": "Soft drinks manufacturers, pubs, convenience stores and off licences have joined forces to fight a planned sugar tax before the launch of a government consultation. Former chancellor George Osborne announced plans for a levy on drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml in his March budget. The proposal is expected to form part of a delayed childhood obesity strategy. Details of the tax, which is expected to come into force in April 2018, have yet to be confirmed, but health campaigners have suggested it should be 20% of the sale price of a fizzy drink. The Face the Facts, Can the Tax campaign launching on Tuesday claims the tax will do nothing to tackle obesity while putting thousands of jobs at risk and raising prices. A study published last month by the thinktank Oxford Economics suggested that the tax would reduce sales of soft drinks sold by just 1.6% but could lead to more than 4,000 job losses in the UK and \u00a3132m fall in the industry\u2019s economic contribution. Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association which is funding for the campaign, said: \u201cWe absolutely agree with the government that obesity levels are too high and action is needed, but burdening businesses and consumers with an ineffective tax is not the answer.\u201d Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, said the new levy would increase the tax burden on pubs and push up prices. However, sugary drinks\u2019 link to obesity have been well documented with evidence suggesting they account for 29% of 11- to 18-year-olds\u2019 daily sugar intake. The charity Action on Sugar has said the tax will have an impact on intake because people respond to price. The campaign comes after soft drinks firms including Coca-Cola spoke out against the tax while the UK industry body, the Food &amp; Drink Federation, urged the government to delay it following the Brexit vote. The government recently delayed the publication of its childhood obesity strategy, initially planned to be launched last year, until this autumn.",

      "bodyText": "Electricity retailers are price-gouging consumers in Australia, with the big three retailers exploiting a lack of competition and the complexity of electricity bills, according to the results of a new analysis. The situation was worst in South Australia, where retailers were making an average margin of $425 a year more than they did in the regulated market in the Australian Capital Territory, according to the report produced by the economics consultancy CME and commissioned by GetUp. The findings come shortly after another report found generators were \u201cgaming\u201d the wholesale electricity market in South Australia and just days before state and federal energy ministers meet at the upcoming Coag energy council meeting on Friday. The electricity retail market didn\u2019t work properly because making an informed decision about which deal is the best for a customer is beyond the capabilities of almost everyone, said Bruce Mountain, who wrote the report. \u201cWe have this weird market in which retailers are paying a fortune to market their products \u2013 paying switching companies $180 every time they switch a customer, paying for call centres around the world to phone people incessantly \u2013 but they\u2019re offering practically the same thing,\u201d Mountain said. There was also not enough competition, with AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia dominating the market. In South Australia, the big three retailers were charging an average of $650 above the costs of providing the electricity, which was about 30% of the bill. In the ACT, where the retail market is regulated, retailers\u2019 margins were only about $225, about 20% of the bill. The report noted that compared with other costs in delivering electricity \u2013 such as generating it or distributing it \u2013 very little capital is required to retail the electricity. Mountain also compared the margins of retailers in Australia to those in the UK, where the a government authority found the retailers were exploiting their market power to charge customers at rates that were \u201cabove justifiable levels\u201d. Despite the finding of price-gouging in the UK, the margins charged by retailers in Australia were significantly higher \u2013 40% higher in the case of South Australia. Mountain compared the average offer from the big three retailers with their best offers, as well as the best offers from the other retailers. In all states, the best offers from the smaller retailers resulted in smaller margins for the retailers than the best deals offered by the big three retailers. But he also found the big three did have deals that were cheaper than their average offers. GetUp\u2019s environmental justice campaign director, Miriam Lyons, said: \u201cThe big three have been exploiting their power in the market and South Australian families in particular are getting ripped off. \u201cThis has huge impacts for people struggling to pay unaffordable energy bills. Further lining the pockets of energy execs comes at the expense of Australian families. \u201cWhen this kind of behaviour was revealed in the UK, there was a huge public outcry \u2013 yet their retail charges are a fraction of what the big three charge here.\u201d Mountain said it was possible that the market could get a shake-up with the introduction of new technology like battery storage and the continued uptake of rooftop solar, which might drive innovation in the retail offers. The report used a data-mining tool created by CME, which gathers published retail offers as well as costs charged by the companies that own the poles and wires.",

      "bodyText": "In December, the Guardian published its investigation of Sports Direct that revealed how temporary workers at the retail chain\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters also found that thousands of the company\u2019s warehouse workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of surveillance. This included rigorous searches, on unpaid time, down to the last layer of clothing and being warned they would be sacked if they receive six black marks \u2013 or \u201cstrikes\u201d \u2013 over a six-month period for offences including a \u201cperiod of reported sickness\u201d, \u201cerrors\u201d and \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d. The reports provoked the following responses from the company. Working conditions The company did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s reports for a week, when it announced that it would launch a review of all agency staff terms and conditions to be overseen personally by its founder Mike Ashley. The billionaire has said the review will never be completed and he has never publicly reported its findings. Ashley has since also appointed a law firm, RPC, to conduct a review but trade unions say RPC is insufficiently independent because it has acted for Ashley on several occasions. The billionaire has pledged to review the use of the six-strikes policy. Pay Almost a fortnight after the internal review was announced, Sports Direct reacted again by pledging a 15p an hour staff pay rise at a cost of \u00a310m a year. When giving evidence to this year\u2019s parliamentary inquiry into working conditions at the retailer, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201c[The] increase to the minimum wage that was introduced as a consequence of non-payment of national minimum wage \u2013 that is the reality of it \u2013 [the rise] covers that and prevents a further claim.\u201d While appearing before the same committee, the billionaire admitted that his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage and that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the group\u2019s workers to be docked 15 minutes of pay for being one minute late for work. He also admitted that \u201cbottlenecks\u201d caused while staff were searched at the end of shifts and which prevented them leaving the site were not \u201ceven slightly acceptable\u201d and said the problem had been solved. This week, Unite announced that Sports Direct workers would receive about \u00a31m in back pay. The business Ashley has conceded that he may have to reorganise the company\u2019s senior management as he had been struggling to control the business he founded, in which he still owns a majority stake. It has emerged that large shareholders in Sports Direct are considering voting against the reappointment of the company\u2019s chairman \u2013 Keith Hellawell \u2013 and other directors at next month\u2019s annual general meeting in a bid to force change at the top of the embattled chain.",

      "bodyText": "Workers for the takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo have staged a sixth day of protests over a new pay deal, saying concessions only apply to those who are willing to work in new areas. Last week, the firm, which sends couriers to restaurants including Pizza Express and Wagamama, told workers in some parts of London that it would be trialling a new pay structure. Instead of receiving \u00a37 an hour and \u00a31 for each delivery, under the new rules riders will receive a payment of \u00a33.75 for each delivery. Workers, who are self-employed and provide their own transport and insurance, said that they believed they would earn less under the changes and they were unhappy with the uncertainty it brought, while Labour condemned the move as a return to Victorian Britain. Following complaints, the firm said it would underpin the new deal with guarantees for the first month, and allow workers who did not want to take part in the trial to work in different parts of London. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy stepped in on Sunday to say that workers must be paid the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour unless a court or HMRC rules they are self-employed. Deliveroo\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, William Shu, told the BBC he was sorry that the protests, which began when workers in some parts of London were told they would move to the new payment structure, had escalated. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry things have gone to this point. Our riders are the lifeblood of our business and without them we are nothing,\u201d he told the Today programme. He said the new pay plan was \u201cin response to our riders\u2019 number-one concern, which is flexibility \u2026 This was a choice for them. If the riders choose to be on a new scheme that\u2019s great \u2026 If riders feel like it\u2019s not for them, they can choose to work on the old scheme as well.\u201d Riders, however, said that to opt out they would have to move to a new delivery area, which could mean earning less money through the \u00a31-a-delivery commission. Margaret Dewhurst from the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said: \u201cRiders have spent time building up their patch. They\u2019ve been learning their areas for two or three years. \u201cChanging zone will mean moving somewhere central which they don\u2019t know, so they will end up doing fewer deliveries.\u201d A rider picketing outside the firm\u2019s recruitment office in north London on Monday said that moving riders to zones outside the trial would mean \u201cthose zones are flooded so you will get fewer hours\u201d. David Scott, Deliveroo\u2019s operations manager for the UK and Ireland, said he was confident that the new system was better for riders and confirmed the trial would be going ahead from Wednesday. He said workers would be able to log in whenever they wished for work, and in peak hours could earn more than with the hourly rate. \u201cThey can choose to stay on the old rate in a nearby zone,\u201d he said. \u201cThese areas are very small and very local \u2026 We are going to be supporting them if they want to move. The business is growing very fast so we won\u2019t add in any more people than are needed.\u201d Scott said workers were having to sign up to new terms and conditions for the trial partly to show that they knew what they were moving onto, and that he was keen to hear feedback from riders. \u201cA fee structure that doesn\u2019t work for our riders will not work for Deliveroo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an open door policy here. I have invited riders to come in and see us.\u201d A sign at the door of the office saying that drivers could only visit by appointment was \u201cvery much out-of-date\u201d he said. Asked what would happen after the 90-day trial, Scott said: \u201cIf they are not comfortable with continuing with the trial we will address that when we come to it.\u201d Amir Ali, who has been striking since last week, said the concessions were not enough, but he expected a further offer. \u201cNow the government has got involved it\u2019s on a different level,\u201d he said. Michael Boyle, a cyclist who works in central London, said that over lunchtime he had taken one order in four hours. \u201cUnder the new rules I would have earned just \u00a33.75,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flexibility is fantastic and I do still consider them a good employer, but this is such a drastic change \u2026 the company is outsourcing risk to us.\u201d The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, said the government needed to do more to crack down on \u201cdodgy employment practices\u201d. She said: \u201cThe new offer made by their employers still falls far below a living wage and fails to address the fact that riders\u2019 employment contracts offer no security in the event of sickness or accidents. \u201cThis strike highlights that while the \u2018gig economy\u2019 means cheaper and more convenient services for customers, it all too often relies on \u2013 and facilitates \u2013 the exploitation of workers.\u201d A fund for the striking workers had reached more than \u00a38,000 on Monday afternoon.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers are set to receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. The sportswear chain and its employment agencies are also facing fines of up to \u00a32m imposed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) after they were found to have been underpaying some of the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers for four years. The move, which follows an undercover Guardian investigation last year that exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal minimum, is to include payments backdated to May 2012 and could be worth up to \u00a31,000 for some workers, trade union officials estimate. The agreement, which is understood to have been struck between the union Unite, the retailer and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, includes about 200 workers directly employed by Sports Direct and around 3,000 staff hired through temporary employment agencies. Two agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, provide most of the labour in the company\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Notices informing the companies how much the government believes staff have been underpaid, as well as how much each employer will be fined, are expected to be sent to the employers by BEIS this week. Those familiar with the deal, however, say that 1,700 Transline agency workers may initially receive just half the back pay they are owed when payments begin from the end of the month. This is because the agency is refusing to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival agency, Blue Arrow, two years ago. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, described the agreement as a significant victory that demonstrated the importance of modern trade unions in Britain. \u201cInvestors and customers alike should not be fooled into thinking that everything is now rosy at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. Transline, one of the employment agencies involved, is disgracefully still trying to short-change workers by seeking to duck its responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cDeep-seated problems still remain regarding the use of agency workers with the behaviour of both Transline and The Best Connection further jeopardising Sports Direct\u2019s battered reputation.\u201d Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, has led a long-running campaign against working conditions at the Shirebrook depot. Sports Direct and The Best Connection did not comment. A spokesman for Transline said: \u201cWe are making all payments required in full compliance with HMRC\u201d. A Blue Arrow spokesperson, added: \u201cBlue Arrow is aware of the situation at Sports Direct. We take the welfare of our workers very seriously and work closely with all our customers to ensure legal requirements are met. Our contract ended with Sports Direct on 25 May 2014, however we will co-operate fully with any ongoing or future HMRC investigation\u201d. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cI welcome the fact that thousands of Sports Direct workers will at last be paid what is due to them, following the scandalous failure of their employer to pay the minimum wage. \u201cBut it should not have taken months of pressure from MPs, trade unions and the general public. In light of the appalling practices at Sports Direct, it is only right that the Government imposes fines to send a clear signal to other rogue employers.\u201d In June, Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. The concession, which was made when he appeared before MPs investigating his firm\u2019s treatment of its workers in June, confirmed the findings of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, which revealed that warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift, during which their time was unpaid. They also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift a minute late. The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the then statutory minimum wage rate of \u00a36.70, saving the firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK. Ashley told MPs that he had moved to address the queues of workers waiting, unpaid, to be searched at the end of each shift, but also admitted that docking workers 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late was unacceptable and unreasonable. Both practices had led to breaches of minimum wage legislation, the Guardian investigation found. HMRC said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about doing deals. While we don\u2019t discuss individual cases we won\u2019t accept anything less than what\u2019s owed. Our role is to investigate all cases where we believe an employer is not paying its workers the national minimum wage to ensure those workers receive what they are owed under the law.\u201d BEIS said: \u201cAll employers are automatically considered for naming where the investigation has been closed and the arrears owed are over \u00a3100. There are only very limited circumstances where an employer can avoid being named.\u201d Monday\u2019s announcement covers only those working in the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. Last month the Guardian revealed how the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay workers the legal minimum is understood to have been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers. The changing world of work is an important area for the Guardian. Our investigation into Sports Direct - and more recently online delivery company Hermes - has demonstrated that a fair wage for all is still something we cannot take for granted.

Our role is to investigate all cases where we believe an employer is not paying its workers the national minimum wage to ensure those workers receive what they are owed under the law.\u201d</p> <p>BEIS said: \u201cAll employers are automatically considered for naming where the investigation has been closed and the arrears owed are over \u00a3100. There are only very limited circumstances where an employer can avoid being named.\u201d</p> <p>Monday\u2019s announcement covers only those working in the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. Last month the Guardian revealed how the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay workers the legal minimum is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/sports-direct-minimum-wage-probe-set-to-be-extended-to-shop-staff\">understood to have been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers</a>. </p> <ul> <li>The changing world of work is an important area for the Guardian.

      "bodyText": "PS: It\u2019s also worth noting that the oil price has hit a one-month high, with Brent crude trading around $48.12 per barrel. Persistent speculation that the OPEC cartel might actually agree a production freeze are the main factor. City AM has more details. Hello again. Just popping back to record that Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a new 14-month high tonight. The index of blue-chip shares ended the day 25 points higher, at 6,941 - as the weak pound benefited international firms like mining group Anglo American (up 1.8%) and Glaxo (up 1.2%). OK, we seem to have run out of news for the day. And it\u2019s sunny out there. So I\u2019m wrapping up for the day, but we\u2019ll be back it anything important happens.... GW Newsflash: the Bank of England has successfully bought \u00a31.17bn of UK government bonds, as part of its new stimulus programme. So, no repeat of last week\u2019s failed reserve auction, when the BoE couldn\u2019t prise enough long-dated bonds out of their owners\u2019 clutches. However.... today\u2019s auction was for bonds of 3 to 7-years maturity, not the longer dated stuff. That auction is taking place tomorrow.... The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading, despite the weak Empire manufacturing report. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all ticked up to new all-time highs, expending last week\u2019s rally. A closely watched survey of US business confidence in the New York area has come in way below forecasts, giving us another reason to worry. The Empire Manufacturing index slumped to -4.21 this month, down from +0.55 in July. Economists had expected it to rise to 2.00; instead, firms in the area warned that work conditions have weakened. Remember Mark Carney\u2019s warning on 4 August that lenders had no excuses not to pass on the cut in interest rates to 0.25% to borrowers? Lloyds Banking Group has finally responded, saying it will pass on the full cut to all mortgage customers on its variable-rates deals. It\u2019s significant, as Lloyds is the largest lender in the country since the takeover of HBOS during the crisis. Here are the new rates: Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate \u20133.99% currently - falls to 3.74% as does the Halifax Standard Variable Rate and the Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate. This is thought to affect around a third of its 3 million mortgage customers. The bank, 9% owned by taxpayers, is also warning savers that they will take a hit. It is not immediately clear what the scale of the cut will be. The bank said. \u201cWe will not make any changes to our savings rates for existing customers until we have reduced our mortgage reversionary rates (Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate, Halifax Standard Variable Rate and Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate) with effect from 1 October 2016\u201d The pound is losing ground against the US dollar, as well as the euro. Sterling just hit a one-month low of $1.2883, as traders hunker down ahead of some crucial economic data that may show the impact of the Brexit vote. Tomorrow we get July\u2019s inflation report, followed by unemployment surveys on Wednesday and then July\u2019s retail sales figures on Thursday. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains why it matters: This week\u2019s data is a crucial set as it is some of the first to cover the entire month of July and take into account the full effect of Brexit on the UK economy. Sterling looks to have significant downside risk this week as hedge funds increase bearish bets on the currency in the futures market with contracts topping levels last seen in 1992. Whilst we cannot always rely on hedge funds to get it right, market sentiment has declined for Sterling and may do so further as more economic data is released. Good news for Sports Direct workers! The retail chain has coughed up \u00a31m in backpay for employees who received less than the minimum wage, due to its policy of compulsory searches after their shifts had finished. The payments, which could be worth \u00a31,000 each, follow a Guardian investigation into working practices at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse - which also prompted a parliamentary investigation. Simon Goodley reports: The agreement, which is understood to have been struck between the union Unite, the retailer and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, includes workers directly employed by Sports Direct and staff hired through temporary employment agencies. Two agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, provide most of the 3,000 workers in the company\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Payments are expected to begin to be made from the end of this month. Those familiar with the deal, however, say that 1,700 Transline agency workers may initially receive half the back pay they are owed, because the agency is refusing to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival agency two years ago. More here: The prospect of fresh government action to stimulate economic growth has pushed global stocks higher. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has settled at a new 14-month high, while other European markets are at their best levels since the EU referendum. Only Japan is missing out on the rally, following its disappointing growth figures. The mood in the City is pretty quiet, frankly, as we\u2019re now deep into the August slowdown. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says that the prospect of yet more central bank action is pushing money into shares: The month of August typically exhibits the lowest volumes of the summer and given the fact that today marks assumption day across Europe, we are looking likely to see a more unpredictable day. With the Bank of England\u2019s recent QE programme, coupled with heightened expectations of action from the Bank of Japan, there is a clear underlying bullish sentiment for stocks, with investors favouring stocks in this low interest rate environment. The pound has slipped to a new three-year low against the euro this morning, as Brexit angst continues to weigh it down. Sterling fell to \u20ac1.1555 against the single currency, its lowest level since 2013. That means it has shed almost 12% since Britain voted to leave the EU - something for holidaymakers to ponder as they head over the Channel.... Apart from that, the foreign exchange markets are pretty quiet: Customers at banking giant Santander are waking up to the news that their 123 current account just became rather less lucrative. Santander has slashed the interest rate on the account to 1.5%, from 3%, following the Bank of England\u2019s decision to slash benchmark borrowing costs to 0.25%. Another small milestone for Germany\u2019s stock market: Back to Japan...and the disappointing news that its economy only expanded by a tiny 0.05% in the last quarter. Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities, says the Japanese economy is still troubled despite the best efforts of its government and central bank. \u201cConsumer spending is weak, and the reason is low wage gains. There is alot of uncertainty about overseas economies, and this is holding back capital expenditure. \u201cThe government has already announced a big stimulus package, so the next question is how the Bank of Japan will respond after its comprehensive policy review, which is sure tolead to a delay in its price target.\u201d Japan\u2019s economy looks a little better, though, if you consider nominal GDP (growth plus inflation). That shows that the economy is steadily clawing its way out of its deflationary swamp: UK borrowing costs are close to record lows this morning. The 10-year British gilt is changing hands at an interest rate of just 0.51%, a new alltime low, meaning the UK could borrow extremely cheaply for the next decade. Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist at investment group BlackRock, has tweeted that this gives chancellor Philip Hammond the chance to borrow and spend more: Harrison, incidentally, is former chief of staff to ex-chancellor George Osborne.... The takeover battle raging in Britain\u2019s bookmaking industry has taken another twist this morning. William Hill has formally rejected a \u00a33.16bn bid filed by rivals 888 Holdings and Rank Group over the weekend, saying it \u201csubstantially undervalued\u201d its business. More here. Accountancy software firm Sage are usually too dull to catch our eye. But not today! Sage\u2019s shares have slumped by 4% this morning, after it fell victim to a security breach. The company admitted over the weekend than the personal details of workers at 280 British companies may have been compromised, after an internal login was used to gain unauthorised access to their data. European stock markets have opened calmly, as investors take the weak Japanese growth figures in their stride. (Alternatively, they\u2019re shattered after watching the Olympics all night). Either way, European markets are close to their highest levels in seven years. Here\u2019s the situation: The FTSE 100: up 5 points at 6920 Germany\u2019s DAX: up 12 points at 10,726 French CAC: up 3 points at 4,503. HSBC economist Jing Li has told his clients to expect new stimulus measures from China soon: \u201cIn light of persistent headwinds from the external sector, weak business sentiment, and a cooling property market, we believe that policymakers need to accelerate policy easing and reforms.\u201d In China, shares have hit a seven-month high as investors anticipate fresh government stimulus efforts. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index jumped by 2.5% today to close at 3,125. That level was last seen in early January, as world stock markets were hit by a global selloff. The rally is sparked by speculation that Beijing will take fresh steps to help its economy, after a raft of weak economic data. Last week, for example, we got disappointing trade, latest industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment data. Japan\u2019s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, has warned that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU threatens its recovery. Ishihara said (via Reuters): \u201cJapan\u2019s economy is likely to achieve a recovery driven by private demand\u201d though the government must be mindful of risks such as slowing emerging market growth and uncertainty over the fate of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a weekend of sporting excitement, we\u2019ve come down to earth this morning with the worrying news that Japan\u2019s economy stagnated in the last quarter. Japanese GDP was virtually unchanged in the three months between April and June, according to new data released overnight (just as Andy Murray was rounding off Super Sunday in style). Economists had expected growth of 0.2% during the quarter, following the +0.5% growth recorded in January-March. On an annualized basis (basically, multiplying the quarterly figure by 4) , GDP expanded by a meagre 0.2%, much worse than the 1.9% recorded three months ago. It suggests that prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s huge, three-pronged stimulus programme is failing to shake the country out of its long stretch of economic weakness: We\u2019ll be mopping up reaction to this data, along with other key events through the day. There\u2019s not much in the diary, though, apart from the US Empire Manufacturing survey at 1.30pm BST, plus financial results from UK housebuilder Bovis.",

Shares of Bovis and other housebuilders fell heavily after the referendum result was announced, with fears that a resulting economic slowdown would cause a property crash. Estate agents have issued a string of profit warnings but sales of new homes appear to have held up better than for secondhand properties. Ritchie said Bovis had assured its contractors that it intended to stick to its plans for building new homes. After plunging by more than a third on the day after the vote, Bovis shares remain about 20% below their pre-referendum level. The company\u2019s shares fell 2.4% to 816p.",

One example is the furore over the plan for a new and hugely expensive nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. Another is provided by the latest official statistics on the sort of energy the UK uses and where it comes from. The good news is that Britain is consuming 17% less energy than it was in 1998, and more of what is used is coming from renewable sources. But don\u2019t get too excited. Green energy has increased from 1% of the total to just 9%. The bad news is that the percentage of energy Britain now has to import has returned to the levels last seen in the early 1970s, before North Sea oil came on stream. In the late 1990s, the UK exported 20% more energy than it imported. Today its imports are only just below the average for the EU. All this makes depressing reading. From the start, it was clear that North Sea oil was a finite resource, but governments acted as if the black gold would never stop flowing. Britain could have used its once-in-a-lifetime windfall to set up a sovereign wealth fund to cope with the pressures of an ageing population. It could have recycled the booming tax revenues from the continental shelf to start building some new energy plant before the old power stations became obsolete. In the end it did neither, with the results that we have now: power stations coming to the end of their lives at a time when the public finances are deep in the red.

      "bodyText": "Deliveroo\u2019s chief executive has apologised for allowing a dispute with his riders to escalate after the government intervened at the weekend. Deliveroo has been at odds with its couriers in London over changes to terms that riders said would significantly reduce their earnings. The plan prompted hundreds to protest against an attempt to pay them for each delivery instead of an hourly rate. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy stepped in on Sunday to say that workers must be paid the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour unless a court or HMRC rules that they are self-employed. William Shu, Deliveroo\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said that under the old pay plan of \u00a37 an hour plus \u00a31 per delivery, riders made \u00a39.20 to \u00a39.30 an hour not including tips, and that he expected them to earn more under the new arrangement, which pays \u00a33.75 per delivery. He said, however, that riders could choose to stick with the terms of the old plan. Deliveroo has said the new plan is a trial and applies to only 280 of its 3,000 riders in London. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry things have gone to this point. Our riders are the lifeblood of our business and without them we are nothing,\u201d Shu told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. The new pay plan \u201cis in response to our riders\u2019 number-one concern, which is flexibility \u2026 This was a choice for them. If the riders choose to be on a new scheme that\u2019s great \u2026 If riders feel like it\u2019s not for them, they can choose to work on the old scheme as well.\u201d There appeared to be confusion over the options for riders who want to stay on the same terms. A blog on the firm\u2019s website said it had \u201coffered them the choice to stick with the current fee model if they prefer\u201d. An email sent to workers, however, said that to opt out of the trial they would need to work in a different part of London. It also offered guaranteed minimum payments for the first month of the new structure. At peak hours at the weekend it will guarantee riders receive at least \u00a311.25 an hour plus tips and petrol, but between 2.30pm and 6.30pm each day and after 10pm it will pay \u00a33.75 per delivery. The firm said that those signing up to the trial would need to sign up to new terms and conditions in their contracts. Riders said that to opt out they would have to move to a new delivery area, which could mean earning less money through the \u00a31-a-delivery commission. Margaret Dewhurst from the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), said: \u201cRiders have spent time building up their patch. They\u2019ve been learning their areas for two or three years. Changing zone will mean moving somewhere central which they don\u2019t know, so they will end up doing fewer deliveries.\u201d A rider picketing outside the firm\u2019s recruitment office in north London on Monday told the Guardian that moving riders to zones outside the trial would mean \u201cthose zones are flooded so you will get fewer hours\u201d. Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants that do not have their own delivery service, charging the customers \u00a32.50 per delivery. Its clients include Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen. Shu denied riders were under pressure to get deliveries made quickly. The former investment banker worked as a rider for Deliveroo for eight months to help him understand the logistics. \u201cI know exactly what it is like \u2013 the hardships and the work involved to be a rider. Under no circumstances are we pressuring people to go super-fast on the road.\u201d The Green party\u2019s leader, Natalie Bennett, said the government needed to do more to \u201ccrack down on these dodgy employment practises\u201d. She said: \u201cThe new offer made by their employers still falls far below a living wage and fails to address the fact that riders\u2019 employment contracts offer no security in the event of sickness or accidents. \u201cThis strike highlights that while the \u2018gig economy\u2019 means cheaper and more convenient services for customers, it all too often relies on \u2013 and facilitates \u2013 the exploitation of workers.\u201d \u2022 This article has been amended to make clear that Deliveroo had offered a choice of pay plans to drivers and riders before the government intervened.",

    "webTitle": "William Hill rejects 888 and Rank's revised takeover approach", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "William Hill has rejected a revised takeover proposal worth more than \u00a33bn from 888 Holdings and Rank Group, saying there was no merit in entering into talks. The bookmaker said it received an unsolicited proposal from online gambling company 888 and casino operator Rank on 14 August after turning down an approach on 8 August. The revised proposal is 199p a share in cash, plus 0.86% of a share from a proposed combination of 888 and Rank. The cash component is unchanged, but William Hill shareholders would own 48.8% of the combined group, up from 44.6% under the earlier proposal. Based on the three companies\u2019 market values on 22 July, the day before 888 and Rank\u2019s interest was made public, the proposal is worth 352p a share, William Hill said. On that basis, the proposal values the company at about \u00a33.1bn. William Hill said the proposed offer was 12% higher than its share price on 22 July \u2013 too low a premium \u2013 and worth 13p a share more than its rivals\u2019 earlier approach. The bookmaker\u2019s shares fell by 2.6% to 325p, suggesting that investors do not expect a deal to result from the tussle between the companies. With the deadline of 21 August approaching for 888 and Rank to make a firm offer, the latter has delayed its annual results presentation by five days to 23 August. The deal is risky because it involves a complex three-way combination and \u00a32.2bn of extra debt for the proposed merged group, William Hill said, adding that the small premium does not compensate shareholders for the risk, and proposed cost cuts of at least \u00a3100m a year may not materialise. Gareth Davis, the chairman of William Hill, said: \u201cThis revised proposal continues to substantially undervalue the company and the cash element of the proposal has not changed. Therefore, the board sees no merit in engaging. As we have said before, this is highly opportunistic and complex, and does not enhance the strategic positioning of William Hill.\u201d The joint approach for William Hill has caught the bookmaker at a low ebb. The company is looking for a chief executive after ousting James Henderson last month following its failure to capitalise on a growing online betting market. Using a different calculation method, 888 and Rank said the proposed offer was worth 394p a share to William Hill shareholders, valuing the company at \u00a33.4bn. They urged the company\u2019s board to enter talks that could unearth further cost savings. The potential bidders argue that extra debt would be affordable because of low interest rates and the combined group would be able to reduce its borrowings rapidly. It would be Britain\u2019s biggest multi-channel gambling company, combining William Hill\u2019s high street betting shops with Rank\u2019s casinos and bingo halls, as well as online sports betting and gaming, they said. Analysts at stockbrokers Goodbody said: \u201cThere is difference in the value both companies are attaching to proposed offer and William Hill\u2019s board continues to have concerns around a number of key issues. In order to change this view, it looks like a further increase in the proposed offer would have to be reached before they would even start to engage with the consortium.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>William Hill has rejected a revised takeover proposal worth more than \u00a33bn from 888 Holdings and Rank Group, saying there was no merit in entering into talks.</p> <p>The bookmaker said it received an unsolicited proposal from online gambling company 888 and casino operator Rank on 14 August after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/william-hill-rejects-takeover-bid-rank-888\">turning down an approach</a> on 8 August.</p> <p>The revised proposal is 199p a share in cash, plus 0.86% of a share from a proposed combination of 888 and Rank. The cash component is unchanged, but William Hill shareholders would own 48.8% of the combined group, up from 44.6% under the earlier proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/betting-industry-william-hill-888-rank\">When bookies can\u2019t pull in the punters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Based on the three companies\u2019 market values on 22 July, the day before 888 and Rank\u2019s interest was made public, the proposal is worth 352p a share, William Hill said. On that basis, the proposal values the company at about \u00a33.1bn.</p> <p>William Hill said the proposed offer was 12% higher than its share price on 22 July \u2013 too low a premium \u2013 and worth 13p a share more than its rivals\u2019 earlier approach. </p> <p>The bookmaker\u2019s shares fell by 2.6% to 325p, suggesting that investors do not expect a deal to result from the tussle between the companies. With the deadline of 21 August approaching for 888 and Rank to make a firm offer, the latter has delayed its annual results presentation by five days to 23 August.</p> <p>The deal is risky because it involves a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/betting-industry-william-hill-888-rank\">complex three-way combination</a> and \u00a32.2bn of extra debt for the proposed merged group, William Hill said, adding that the small premium does not compensate shareholders for the risk, and proposed cost cuts of at least \u00a3100m a year may not materialise.</p> <p>Gareth Davis, the chairman of William Hill, said: \u201cThis revised proposal continues to substantially undervalue the company and the cash element of the proposal has not changed. Therefore, the board sees no merit in engaging. As we have said before, this is highly opportunistic and complex, and does not enhance the strategic positioning of William Hill.\u201d</p> <p>The joint approach for William Hill has caught the bookmaker at a low ebb. The company is looking for a chief executive after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/21/william-hill-sacks-chief-executive-james-henderson\">ousting James Henderson</a> last month following its failure to capitalise on a growing online betting market.</p> <p>Using a different calculation method, 888 and Rank said the proposed offer was worth 394p a share to William Hill shareholders, valuing the company at \u00a33.4bn. They urged the company\u2019s board to enter talks that could unearth further cost savings. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The potential bidders argue that extra debt would be affordable because of low interest rates and the combined group would be able to reduce its borrowings rapidly. It would be Britain\u2019s biggest multi-channel gambling company, combining William Hill\u2019s high street betting shops with Rank\u2019s casinos and bingo halls, as well as online sports betting and gaming, they said. </p> <p>Analysts at stockbrokers Goodbody said: \u201cThere is difference in the value both companies are attaching to proposed offer and William Hill\u2019s board continues to have concerns around a number of key issues. In order to change this view, it looks like a further increase in the proposed offer would have to be reached before they would even start to engage with the consortium.\u201d</p>",

Over the past nine months, these promises have faded one by one, and this week couriers heard that Deliveroo would be enforcing a new contract that would decimate our income. A day working for Deliveroo doesn\u2019t start at 9 and end at 5; you begin at 11.30am, work until 1.30pm, then start again at 5.30pm until 9.30pm. For many, it makes no sense to go home during the afternoon hiatus, so they continue to work off the clock, meaning they don\u2019t receive the \u00a37 hourly rate. If you see a Deliveroo courier between the hours of 2pm and 5pm, it could well be they\u2019re working for as little as \u00a33 or \u00a34 an hour. My zone, where I collect and deliver orders, is Marylebone, Mayfair and Soho. Other zones are huge \u2013 I have a friend in Putney who regularly cycles three or four miles to a restaurant, then just as many more miles to the customer.
