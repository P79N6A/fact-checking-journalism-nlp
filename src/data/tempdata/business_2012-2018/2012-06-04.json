      "bodyText": "Europe's leaders appear to be edging towards an ambitious and controversial new blueprint for a federalised eurozone after Paris and Brussels threw their weight behind Spain's pleas for an EU rescue of its beleaguered banks. At the start of three weeks likely to be crucial to the survival of the euro, the new French government and the European commission voiced strong backing for a new eurozone \"banking union\" to save the single currency. The plan could see vast national debt and banking liabilities pooled \u2013 and then backed by the financial strength of Germany \u2013 in return for eurozone governments surrendering sovereignty over their budgets and fiscal policies to a central eurozone authority. Spain's banking crisis, together with extreme volatility in Greece ahead of the rerun general election on 17 June and the French parliamentary poll on the same day, are compounding the febrile atmosphere and worrying the markets. A \"gang of four\" \u2013 the European council president, the commission chief, the president of the European Central Bank and the head of the eurogroup of 17 finance ministers \u2013 has been charged with drafting the proposals for a deeper eurozone fiscal union, to be presented to an EU summit at the end of the month. \"You can't demand eurobonds but not be prepared for the next step in European integration,\" Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, said at the weekend. \"We won't be able to create a successful currency like that and no one outside will lend us money any more.\" Pierre Moscovici, the new French finance minister, said eurozone bailout funds should be used to inject cash into collapsing banks. Such direct payments are impossible under existing rules. Moscovici added that France wants the summit to set up a eurozone banking union, which would take on responsibility for propping up failing banks and guarantee depositors' savings across the 17 countries. The commission and France are piling pressure on Germany to line up behind the proposal, which Merkel would need to take to her parliament for agreement. Renewed focus on Merkel came as she endured some of the strongest criticism yet seen during the 30-month crisis for the way she has handled the euro turbulence. Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister, warned that his country was at risk of destroying itself and Europe for the third time in a century, and gave Merkel just a few months to change course and save the currency. In an article published on Monday, he wrote: \"Germany destroyed itself \u2013 and the European order \u2013 twice in the 20th century. It would be both tragic and ironic if a restored Germany, by peaceful means and with the best of intentions, brought about the ruin of the European order a third time.\" At a meeting in Berlin on Monday night, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, was expected to press Merkel on the issue of bank rescues, which has turned critical because of Spain's banking emergency. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is reluctant to request a full-scale EU bailout because it would come with draconian and humiliating terms. He has the support of Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs. \"It is important to consider this alternative of direct bank recapitalisation,\" said Rehn, \"to break the link between the sovereigns and the banks.\" Under existing rules for the bailout fund, money may go only to governments that can request a state rescue and then use the cash to shore up their distressed banks. The vast bulk of the Irish bailout has gone directly to the country's ailing banks. On his debut visit to Brussels, Moscovici called for a change in those rules: \"We are in favour of this banking union,\" he said. \"It's a fundamental issue for which proposals are on the table.\" Spain's most senior banker, Emilio Botin, boss of Santander, called on Europe's rescue funds to help out. He said four of Spain's banks needed \u20ac40bn (\u00a332bn) of new capital \"and that will be enough\". Botin's figures reportedly include \u20ac19bn that the Spanish government has already pledged to pump into stricken lender Bankia \u2013 cash that Spain does not have. Botin's assessment is at odds with banking analysts, who estimate that Spain's banks need up to \u20ac100bn. Santander, which operates a ringfenced banking business in the UK, is not among those judged to need fresh capital. However, it is likely that if new direct bank support were approved for Spain, Ireland and Portugal might request similar treatment. In a speech in Italy at the weekend, the financier George Soros warned that Merkel had no more than three months to fix the euro, but outlined the prospect of a grim new eurozone controlled by Berlin. \"The likelihood is that the euro will survive because a breakup would be devastating not only for the periphery but also for Germany,\" he said. \"Germany is likely to do what is necessary to preserve the euro \u2013 but nothing more. \"That would result in a eurozone dominated by Germany in which the divergence between the creditor and debtor countries would continue to widen and the periphery would turn into permanently depressed areas in need of constant transfer of payments \u2026 it would be a German empire with the periphery as the hinterland.\" The proposals being drafted for the summit are certain to feature calls for a form of eurobond whereby Germany and other smaller creditor countries guarantee the debts of the struggling member states. The blueprint, not yet finalised, has been played down by the European commission. \"There is no masterplan,\" said a spokeswoman, Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen. The notion was also rubbished in Berlin on Monday \u2013 but not ruled out. \"We are talking about several years and certainly not a solution that we are thinking about in the current problematic situation,\" said Merkel's spokesman. In return for yielding to the pressure to pay to save the euro, Berlin will insist on major steps towards a eurozone federation or political union with budgetary, fiscal, and scrutiny powers vested in Brussels and in the European Court of Justice, meaning vast transfers of sovereignty from member states. The Portuguese government said three of its leading banks would receive capital injections of \u20ac5.8bn, using funds provided under the country's \u20ac78bn state bailout. The banks included Portugal's largest, Millennium, as well as BPI and state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos. Only one of the country's major banks, Banco Espirito Santo, is surviving without state funding.",

      "bodyText": "A pair of scientists have accused BP of an attack on academic freedom after the oil company successfully subpoenaed thousands of confidential emails related to research on the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster.

However, just as revolts over executive pay seemed to affect sectors indiscriminately, there seems no obvious pattern as to which pay consultant ended up in the middle of the controversy. Of the notable investor revolts this year, Deloitte acted for Aviva and AstraZeneca, Towers Watson acted for Barclays (although it has now been replaced) and William Hill, Kepler was employed by Trinity Mirror and Hewitt New Bridge Street advised Premier Foods.",

      "bodyText": "Britain could be asked to underwrite up to \u20ac6bn (\u00a34.8bn) towards a bailout of Greece if the country exits the euro, according to a thinkthank report released on Monday. David Cameron may also face calls for concessions including a referendum on EU membership if a Greek exit prompts full treaty change, a report by Open Europe said. There are growing concerns about the consequences should Athens leave the euro in a so-called \"Grexit\", which have escalated in the runup to the Greek general election on 17 June. Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, has predicted that the new government in Athens is likely to reach a deal with creditors, allowing the country to remain in the euro temporarily. \"However, as Greece approaches a balanced budget and a more stable banking sector, though still messy, an exit will look increasingly attractive,\" he said. The total cost of supporting Greece if it left the currency could be anything between \u20ac67bn and \u20ac259bn in external and immediate short-term support \u2013 in addition to longer-term costs or contagion affecting markets \u2013 according to Open Europe. \"This support could potentially be split between the IMF, the eurozone and non-euro countries, with the UK possibly underwriting between \u20ac4bn and \u20ac6bn of the entire rescue package,\" the thinkthank said. British taxpayers have so far avoided any direct contribution to the temporary bailout fund, the European financial stability facility and its imminent successor, the European stability mechanism. Cameron has said that he has won assurances from the EU that Britain would not have to contribute to any fresh rescue for Greece. But Open Europe argues the UK would be likely to take part through the IMF. The UK underwrites about 13% of the fund, which still contains \u20ac35bn, which would mean that British taxpayers would be involved if it were deployed to aid Greece. The government is likely to dismiss the Open Europe report as speculative. Separately, it is possible that Greece could end up benefiting from an existing \"balance of payments assistance\" facility which was set up to help EU countries outside the eurozone and has in the past been used to help Hungary and Romania.

      "body": "<p>Britain must follow the examples of France and Germany by picking industrial winners, and consider reforming immigration restrictions that threaten companies with a shortage of engineers, according to one of the UK's leading industrialists.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging critique of British industrial policy, Sir John Parker criticised the abolition of polytechnics, suggested universities needed business mentors to help commercialise research and said the country must decide which sectors it will prioritise over the next few decades.</p> <p>Parker, chairman of the mining group Anglo American and former chief executive of shipbuilder Harland and Wolff, said: \"The basic building blocks should be, what do we want to be doing in 20 to 25 years' time?\" Referring to the UK's world-class position in aero engines at Rolls-Royce and wing manufacturing for Airbus, the European aerospace group, he added: \"Do we still want to be designing and building the world's top airplane engines, the wings of every Airbus plane, do we want to be one of the leading pharmaceutical centres in the world? We need those long-term horizons.\"</p> <p>In an interview at the Royal Academy of Engineering, where Parker is president, he said the UK should not focus on individual companies \u2013 with the notion of \"picking winners\" still stirring up memories of failed industrial investments by the state in past decades. \"We are not picking winning companies, we are looking at sectors. They will create a pull for research and development programmes, for skills training and for joined-up thinking across government departments.\" Those winners would be in growth markets with strong export prospects and would have robust supply chains, as in the automotive industry, said Parker.</p> <p>\"I have seen it in other countries, where certain sectors are very important. On the board of [Airbus parent] EADS I see how Germany, France and Spain cherish their aerospace industry and certain areas of the defence industry. There is a culture that is more proactive in some European countries than has been the case here.\"</p> <p>Parker described George Osborne's recent announcement of a \u00a360m centre of excellence for aerodynamics and a \u00a3100m fund for university research as only \"a starter for 10\". Parker said the Royal Academy was keen to \"put its shoulder to the wheel\" and contribute to Lord Heseltine's review, which will examine how the public and private sectors can work together to boost economic development, having contributed to an upcoming government report on shale gas. He added: \"It needs to be fleshed out and I hope that the department for business and the Heseltine review will lead us to a more coherent industrial approach.\"</p> <p>Citing the example of Bombardier, whose UK train building business has struggled over the past year, Parker said a strategy of picking winners would see the government help certain sectors. \"If it was decided that train building is a sector we need to be in over the next 20 years and if you hit a hard spot, as Bombardier has, then you would want to look hard at finding ways to support it, to help it through the trough.\" He added: \"If you don't have that, policymakers have to jump from rock to rock. It is this coherence that we need across government departments, in support of those chosen sectors.\"</p> <p>Parker spoke to the Guardian in the same week that a senior Boeing executive warned the UK that it was following the US in lacking a \"clear and cogent\" industrial policy. Jim Albaugh, the chief executive of the aerospace group's commercial division, added that it would take decades to revive industries that suffer cuts in research and development spending.</p> <p>Describing the conversion of polytechnics into universities as a \"huge mistake\", Parker said the UK would create more than 1.5m jobs between 2010 and 2020 in the so-called Stem fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. If those cannot be filled from British institutions alone, companies will have to look abroad and immigration curbs may need to be relaxed. Parker said. \"If you cannot produce professional engineers you have to go across the world to look for them. If you have artificial constraints on movement into the country then that is unfortunate in these circumstances.\"</p> <p>\"But the priority should be to educate and train our own populace. If we do a good job we might not need any immigration. But the chances are that we will and if that comes about we will have to adjust things,\" he said.</p> <p>Parker indicated that the UK had considerable advantages over other countries, including a strong culture of innovation and invention. However, too much research work in universities does not see the light of day. \"This is the great strength of this country. We have a great inherent research capability. But we need to get better at commercialising, as soon as possible, the many fine pieces of work that are being carried out.\" Converting polytechnics into universities had been a mistake because many institutions lost their technical and vocational focus. \"Vocational training is so important to the health of our manufacturing base.\"</p> <p>A fully fledged industrial strategy would have prevented the polytechnic move, said Parker. \"If we'd had a coherent framework looking 25 years down the road, and an idea of the different skills we needed, we would not have closed the polytechnics. We would have checked it against a coherent strategy. We would have said, for instance, that polytechnics produce engineering skills much needed by the aerospace sector.\"</p> <p>Acknowledging the gap between university research and the commercial world \u2013 dubbed \"death valley\" in the US \u2013 Parker said Britain's best education facilities needed more help in selling their breakthroughs. \"That's the danger. Then someone else will pick up the idea. If it is not commercialised then you have the death valley syndrome.\" Commercial sector mentors, perhaps drawn from the academy's membership, could address the problem, he said. \"We need to get in early to support these people. We are thinking about making [academy] fellows available for universities, to get more business acumen behind groundbreaking research.\"</p> <p>The Royal Academy of Engineering also runs the \u00a31m Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering for outstanding advances in the field. \"I hope it will grab the attention of young people in particular.
