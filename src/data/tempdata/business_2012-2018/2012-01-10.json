After Greece's warning last week that it will be forced to drop out of the single currency unless it receives the \u20ac130bn second bailout it was promised in October, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, held talks in Berlin. Lagarde will be in Paris on Wednesday to meet French president Nicolas Sarkozy, amid reports that the IMF is losing patience with Athens. The Greek government is being urged to crack down on tax avoidance, sell off state assets and implement a series of economic reforms before it can receive the new rescue loan. Also on the agenda for eurozone leaders is the new \"fiscal compact\", to tighten the rules on tax and spending for euro members, and how to boost the euro bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Fresh evidence of the scale of the continuing crisis in Greece also emerged, with news that bank deposits in the recession-hit state declined by 2% in November alone.

The talks in Berlin and Paris were lent fresh urgency by news that struggling banks deposited a record \u20ac481.9bn in the European Central Bank's overnight facility on Monday. These deposits receive a rock bottom interest rate of 0.25%, so the sharp rise suggests banks are increasingly anxious about lending among themselves, and instead are parking their cash in Frankfurt. Meanwhile Britain's status as a relatively safe haven amid the turmoil on the continent was underlined as investors snapped up \u00a3700m-worth of inflation-linked government bonds, driving the real yield below zero for only the second time. Back in Detroit, where American carmakers are banking on a revival in the world's largest economy, Marchionne predicted that Fiat could lose 500,000 vehicle sales annually as a result of the European debt crisis. \"We need to get serious, really serious,\" he said. Fiat is planning to merge with Chrysler by 2014. Under Marchionne the US car firm has bounced back from bankruptcy. Chrysler sales soared 26.2% last year and were up 37.1% in December. The US firm expects to report a profit of about $600m for 2011 and Marchionne has forecast Chrysler will make $3bn in operating profit in 2012. The company recently announced it would add 1,100 jobs to the Detroit plant that makes the Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sean Quinn, once Ireland's richest man, has denounced the bank he once borrowed billions from for taking a \"sledgehammer\" to his business. The former billionaire businessman was speaking after the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation succeeded in having Quinn's bankruptcy status in Northern Ireland overturned at Belfast high court. He now faces the prospect of bankruptcy under Irish republic rules, which would ban him from returning to business for 12 years. In the UK Quinn could have been trading again within 12 months. The former Anglo Irish Bank had argued that the core of Quinn's business interests were in the Irish Republic and not in British territory. The now state-owned bank, which lent billions to Irish property speculators during the boom, said Quinn owes it, and thus the Irish taxpayer, \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.3bn). The businessman borrowed billions from Anglo Irish to create a property portfolio that stretched from the United States to the Middle East and Ukraine. His rise and fall personified the collapse in the Celtic Tiger economy. Quinn had initially declared himself bankrupt in a Belfast court last November because he claimed he was operating in Northern Ireland from an office in Fermanagh, where he was born. But speaking outside the court a bitter Quinn insisted he never worked in the Irish Republic and should have been protected by UK banking laws. \"I never did a day's work from southern Ireland in my life. I never done a day's work in my home. I never had any computers. I never had any IT system. Everything was done from Derrylin. What Anglo Irish has done to the Quinn group is like somebody taking a sledgehammer to a child's toy \u2013 they've destroyed it,\" he said. During its challenge, which began last month, the IBRC claimed that a European directive that applies in insolvency cases stipulates that a person's centre of main interest has to be ascertainable to third parties, such as creditors. Judgment in the case at Belfast high court was given by Mr Justice Donal Deeny. The judge found that a lease for an office in Derrylin, Fermanagh, had been drawn up to \"bolster\" Quinn's claim and that his centre of interest before bankruptcy was, in fact, in the Republic of Ireland between his home in County Cavan, offices in Belturbet and advisers' offices in Dublin. Deeny described the Derrylin lease as \"a somewhat curious document\". The judge added: \"I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that this lease has been prepared at some much later date to try and bolster the case now being made.\" He commented that Quinn had failed to disclose the fact that he held an Irish passport and no British passport, that he was a voter in the Republic of Ireland and that, despite being a UK taxpayer, 20% of his taxes were paid to the authorities in the Republic. Deeny added that he did not think he could safely conclude that this was a deliberate attempt to deceive on the part of Quinn, but found that it was sufficient grounds for him to exercise his discretion to rescind the bankruptcy order had he not already decided to annul it.\" The judge ordered that if Quinn filed a fresh bankruptcy petition in Northern Ireland, notice should be given to the bank's solicitor in Belfast. Deeny said it was likely that any future bankruptcy action by Quinn would be referred to him. The bank's counsel, Gabriel Moss QC, said Quinn was now \"bound to be made bankrupt\" in the Republic of Ireland. Moss is also seeking disclosure of who was funding Quinn's legal action so that they can be pursued for costs.",

Judgment in the case at Belfast high court was given by Mr Justice Donal Deeny.</p> <p>The judge found that a lease for an office in Derrylin, Fermanagh, had been drawn up to \"bolster\" Quinn's claim and that his centre of interest before bankruptcy was, in fact, in the Republic of Ireland between his home in County Cavan, offices in Belturbet and advisers' offices in Dublin.</p> <p>Deeny described the Derrylin lease as \"a somewhat curious document\".</p> <p>The judge added: \"I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that this lease has been prepared at some much later date to try and bolster the case now being made.\"</p> <p>He commented that Quinn had failed to disclose the fact that he held an Irish passport and no British passport, that he was a voter in the Republic of Ireland and that, despite being a UK taxpayer, 20% of his taxes were paid to the authorities in the Republic.</p> <p>Deeny added that he did not think he could safely conclude that this was a deliberate attempt to deceive on the part of Quinn, but found that it was sufficient grounds for him to exercise his discretion to rescind the bankruptcy order had he not already decided to annul it.\"</p> <p>The judge ordered that if Quinn filed a fresh bankruptcy petition in Northern Ireland, notice should be given to the bank's solicitor in Belfast.</p> <p>Deeny said it was likely that any future bankruptcy action by Quinn would be referred to him.</p> <p>The bank's counsel, Gabriel Moss QC, said Quinn was now \"bound to be made bankrupt\" in the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>Moss is also seeking disclosure of who was funding Quinn's legal action so that they can be pursued for costs.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The American Economic Association's annual meetings are a scary sight, with thousands of economists all gathered in the same place \u2013 a veritable weapon of mass destruction. Chicago was the lucky city for 2012 this past weekend, and I had just finished participating in an interesting <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/events/\">panel on \"the economics of regime change\"</a>, when I stumbled over to see what the big budget experts had to say about \"the political economy of the US debt and deficits\".</p> <p>The session was introduced by UC Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach, who put up a graph of the United States' rising debt-to-GDP ratio, and warned of dire consequences if Congress didn't do something about it. Yawn.</p> <p>But the panelists got off to a good start, with Alan Blinder of Princeton, former vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, describing the public discussion of the US national debt as generally ranging from \"ludicrous to horrific\". True, that. He asked and answered four questions.</p> <p>First, is there any urgency (to reduce the deficit or debt)? No. The government can borrow short term at negative real interest rates, and long-term at about zero. The world is paying us to hold their money. That is anything but a debt crisis. The Fed is out of bullets, he said \u2013 referring to the fact that the US Federal Reserve had lowered short-term rates to zero and had used quantitative easing to help keep long-term rates low. So we need more fiscal stimulus, preferably spending that focuses on actually creating jobs. Amen.</p> <p>Second, should we focus on the next decade? No, he said, and noted that the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12039\">budget deficit projections over the next decade</a> are about 3.6% of GDP, which is not much to get agitated about. Also true.</p> <p>Third, is government spending the problem? No, he said, it's healthcare costs, and mainly <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/calculators/hc/hc-calculator.html\">the rising price of healthcare</a> (that is, not the ageing of the population). Most important truth yet! (More on this below.)</p> <p>Fourth, is the public really up in arms about the deficit? No, actually, they <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/148589/concerns-economy-jobs-outweigh-worries-deficit.aspx\">care more about the economy and jobs</a>. As they should.</p> <p>Blinder concluded that since this is an election year, we can forget about having any fact-based discussion of these issues in 2012. Happy New Year, he said, and the audience laughed. Well, that was refreshing, I thought \u2013 an economist telling the unvarnished truth to hundreds of his people at the annual meetings.</p> <p>But a rapid descent into hell was imminent. Former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin was next, talking about the need to \"repair\" social security and Medicare. The United States has all the characteristics of countries that run into trouble, he said. Then he warned that the US is going to end up like Greece. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/24/kenneth-rogoff-deficit-reduction\">This is one of the dumbest things</a> that anyone with an economics degree can say.</p> <p>Hello, Mr Holtz-Eakin! Have you ever heard of the US dollar, the world's key reserve currency? </p> <p>The United States is not going to end up like Greece, any sooner than it will end up like Haiti or Burkina Faso. A country that can pay its foreign public debt in its own currency and runs its own central bank does not end up like Greece.</p> <p>In fact, even Japan is not going to end up like Greece, and Japan has a gross public debt of about 220% of its GDP, more than twice the size of ours and vastly larger \u2013 again, relative to its economy \u2013 than that of Greece. And the yen is nowhere near the dollar in its importance as an international reserve currency. But the Japanese government is still borrowing at just 1% interest rates for its ten-year bonds. </p> <p>At this point, it was clear that this panel, other than Blinder, was living in a dystopian fantasy world. Next up was Rudy Penner of the Urban Institute, another former CBO director. His perspective was not much different from that of Auerbach or Holtz-Eakin. He complained about the polarisation of the political process, which prevents the two major parties from reaching an agreement. It's not partisanship, he said: House speaker Tip O'Neill and President Ronald Reagan knew how to be partisan, but they were able to reach agreement on the 1983 social security package and the 1986 tax reforms. And yada yada.</p> <p>He might have added that we have had 25 years of <a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html\">lying about social security since then</a>, and even Reagan didn't dare try to privatise social security. And, of course, social security <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/\">can currently pay all promised benefits for the next 24 years without any changes</a>.</p> <p>These arguments about polarisation really pose the key issue: from the viewpoint of the 99%, it's not polarisation, but weakness in defending our interests that is the problem. President Obama compromised much more than he should have last year, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-debt-talks-obama-offers-social-security-cuts/2011/07/06/gIQA2sFO1H_story.html\">offering cuts to social security and Medicare</a>, in exchange for a long-term budget deal. The 99% are just lucky that the Republicans were too extremist to make this kind of a \"grand bargain\" with Obama.</p> <p>The last panelist was Alice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution, another former CBO budget director and Fed vice-chair, as well as a member of the president's (2010) National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. She agreed with Blinder that we need more stimulus. But we can only get this if we agree to long-run spending cuts \u2013 including social security, of course. Yuck. This is a political strategy that is sure to end in disaster, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/krugman-nobody-understands-debt.html?ref=paulkrugman\">given the prevailing state of misinformation</a> and disinformation.</p> <p>During the discussion, Blinder \u2013 who identified himself as a Democrat \u2013 expressed his frustration in not being able to convince fellow Democrats to cut social security. Double yuck. The average social security check is about $1,177 a month, and a majority of senior citizens are getting most of their meager income from social security. Why these people insist on creating more poverty among the elderly, especially when the program is solvent for decades to come, is beyond me.</p> <p>I got to ask the first question for the panel. I called attention to Blinder's presentation of the long-term budget problem <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/calculators/hc/hc-calculator.html\">as almost completely a problem</a> of the rising price of healthcare. I pointed out that you could take any country with a life expectancy greater than ours \u2013 including the other high-income countries \u2013 and put their per capita healthcare costs into our budget, and the long-term budget deficit would turn into a surplus.</p> <p>My question was simple: are Americans so inherently different from other nationalities that we can't have similar healthcare costs? And if not, then why are we talking about long-term budget problems \u2013 instead of how to fix our healthcare system?</p> <p>None of the panelists offered a serious answer to this question. Auerbach, the moderator, said that other countries have rising healthcare costs, too. And some of the others said or implied that healthcare costs were rising at an unsustainable pace worldwide.</p> <p>But this is nonsense. The United States <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&amp;-columns/op-eds-&amp;-columns/problems-of-us-health-care-are-rooted-in-the-private-sector-despite-right-wing-claims\">pays about twice as much per person for healthcare</a> as other high-income countries \u2013 and still leaves 50 million people uninsured. This is a result of a dysfunctional healthcare system that has had healthcare prices rising much faster than those of other high-income countries for decades.</p> <p>What the budget hawks are basically telling us is that we must assume that insurance and pharmaceutical companies will have a veto over the provisions of healthcare reform for decades to come. And that, therefore, we must find other ways to make up for these excessive costs, including cutting social security and other government spending, and pushing us into higher rates of poverty and inequality than we already have. </p> <p>And even worse in the short run, all this crap about the deficit and the debt will be used to block the necessary stimulus measures \u2013 \"stimulus\" has already become a dirty word that Democratic politicians are afraid to utter. This means high unemployment and a lot of unnecessary misery in the world's richest country for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>A dismal performance for the dismal science, on some of the most important issues of the day. Of course, there are other economists, including Nobel Prize winners such as Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz and Robert Solow (full disclosure: the latter two are members of CEPR's advisory board), who would offer more sensible views. But this panel was, sadly, representative of economists with the most influence on public policy.</p> <p>With a brain trust like this, a lost decade for America looks likely \u2013 unless the citizenry can steer a different course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In one sense, Ed Miliband is right when he says the public finances were in reasonable shape when the financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007. In the previous financial year, Labour had needed to borrow just over \u00a330bn to balance the books, about 2% of national output. National debt as a share of GDP was rising but at 36% was well below the 40% ceiling set by Labour and was low both by historic and international standards. The big deterioration in the public finances happened subsequently, both as a result of the near-collapse of the banks and due to the deep economic slump that followed. This does not provide the whole picture, however. By 2007, the UK economy had been growing steadily for more than a decade and a half. As Gordon Brown used to boast, there had not been a single quarter of negative economic growth since the early 1990s and unemployment had fallen steadily. In those circumstances, the government finances should have been in better shape than they were: there should have been a sizeable surplus on the current budget \u2013 the day-to-day spending of the state \u2013 and net borrowing (which includes capital spending) should have been lower. A second problem was that Labour believed that the strength of tax receipts was permanent when in fact the Treasury coffers were being artificially boosted by an unsustainable boom in the housing market and by the party atmosphere in the City. When the speculative activity came to an end, the tax receipts dried up and blew a gigantic hole in the public finances. The lack of any alternative sources of growth has meant that Britain's recovery from the slump has been painfully slow, and output is still 4% below its peak in early 2008. Both the government and the opposition are now being forced to confront the reality of this, namely that there is still going to be a chunky hole in the public finances by the time of the next election. Labour's plan for slower deficit reduction would have meant that this would have been the case anyway, but even the more aggressive stance adopted by George Osborne means that austerity will \u2013 unless there is a rapid improvement in the prospects for the economy \u2013 continue for the first two years of the next parliament. The argument deployed by Miliband and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls has some merit. Osborne admitted in last November's autumn statement that sluggishness of growth would mean he would have to borrow well over \u00a3110bn more than he had originally planned. Yet the opposition has so far failed to convince a sceptical public that things would be much different under its modestly less severe austerity programme.",

Twelve months ago the shares were changing hands at 70p and in mid-2008 they peaked at nearly 300p. Game's chief executive, Ian Shepherd, said the retailer, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, was still operating within the terms of its loans and had \u00a3120m cash in the bank. But he said that the difficult market conditions \"raise the likelihood\" it will not meet loan conditions linked to its underlying earnings performance when they are tested on 27 February. \"Our industry had an incredibly tough 2011, and so did we,\" said Shepherd. He added that the retailer was in a \"regular and constructive\" dialogue with its lenders, who remained \"supportive\". \"We remain the market leader and have a clear strategy which will return the business to growth,\" he said. \"We are adapting to the changing market and are well prepared for the next hardware cycle.\" Group like-for-like sales are down 11.9% for the 49 weeks to 7 January, which Shepherd said was better than the wider market contraction of more than 13%. Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said Game could fall to a \u00a330m loss in the current year: \"We are reducing our target price from 10p to 5p on the basis of these weaker numbers and uncertainty as to what the implications will be for equity shareholders after the banks have extracted their pound of flesh.\" Game hopes that next month's European launch of the PlayStation Vita will provide a major sales stimulus for the whole games market, with that console to be followed by the new offering from Nintendo, the Wii U, later this year. Dorgan cautioned, however, that he expected the supermarkets and online operators to be the prime beneficiaries of the debut of the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo Wii U.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A rush to the shops to snap up bargains in the last days before Christmas provided shops and stores with one of their best trading months of 2011 in December, the British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday.</p> <p>Despite the collapse of lingerie chain La Senza and a low-key performance by supermarket group Morrisons, the BRC said deep discounting meant sales in December were 4.1% higher than in the same month of 2010.</p> <p>Stephen Robertson, the lobby group's director general, said: \"A better than hoped-for December closed a relentlessly tough year for retailers, but these figures hinged on a dazzling last pre-Christmas week and were boosted by some major one-off factors. We're not witnessing any fundamental change in customers' circumstances.</p> <p>\"The comparison is with severe snow disruption a year ago. Discounting was deeper and started earlier and the vital Saturday Christmas Eve added another big trading day to the final runup. Post-Christmas offers brought large numbers of shoppers out but that was generally a shortlived hunt for bargains.</p> <p>\"With discounting driving sales at the expense of margins the key question for retailers is about earnings from those sales.\"</p> <p>The BRC's monthly snapshot of retail activity showed that once allowance had been made for the opening of new stores during 2011, so-called like-for-like sales were 2.2% higher last month than in December 2010. Excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter, both total and like-for-like sales growth in December was the strongest since January 2011.</p> <p>Sales of food picked up in December while cut-price offers boosted non-food spending. Consumers waited until the last minute to do their online shopping, with internet sales showing an 18.5% year-on-year increase last month.</p> <p>The supermarket group Wm Morrison on Monday blamed its own disappointing Christmas performance on an austerity drive by Britons who bought fewer treats and cheaper food and drink for the festivities.</p> <p>Dalton Philips, the chief executive, said it had proved tough for retailers to persuade cautious consumers to part with their cash.</p> <p>\"People were making tough choices this Christmas and trading [down] out of certain products,\" said Philips. He said customers were buying less and had waited until the last minute to stock up on Christmas fare such as mince pies and tins of Quality Street as they stuck to tight budgets.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales at the Bradford-based retailer grew by only 0.7% excluding fuel in the six weeks to 1 January, falling short of City expectations of about 1.3%. The figure represented a slowdown from the 2.4% rise in the previous quarter.</p> <p>Once inflation is taken into account, analysts said the retailer's sales volumes must have declined during the important trading period. Although Morrions attracted an extra 800,000 customers a week over the holiday period, Philips said baskets were getting smaller, with shoppers buying \"one less item\".</p> <p>\"In the mass market, which is UK Inc, people are getting squeezed and buying less,\" he said. Champagne sales volumes were down 7% but sparkling wine up 156%, with cheaper alternatives to turkey such as pork also in demand. Sales in the week of Christmas were 25% higher than two years ago with more than 40% of products on sale at cut prices.</p> <p>\"It's very aggressive out there,\" said Philips. He batted away the unfavourable comparison with Morrisons' upmarket rival Waitrose, which last week reported an increase in like-for-like sales of 3.8% for December, implying that its well-heeled shoppers were insulated from the economic downturn than the Morrisons demographic, seen as the \"most average\" of the major supermarkets. \"We have become slightly accustomed to Morrisons leading the way in like-for-like sales terms, with Sainsbury's behind and Asda and Tesco bringing up the rear,\" said Pritchard. \"This Christmas has seen a shift.\"</p> <p>Given Waitrose's success \u2013 and what is expected to be a strong performance from Marks &amp; Spencer's food businesson Tuesday \u2013 he added: \"It seems that a combination of an upmarket offer with some web exposure and strong advertising has been the key to 'winning' Christmas 2011. We suspect that Morrisons' campaign came across as rather uninspiring.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti-based retail group Alshaya said that it had bought 60 of La Senza's stores, saving 1,100 jobs. A further 84 stores and 16 concessions will close with the loss of 1,300 jobs.</p> <p>Richard Fleming, joint administrator and UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \"We are delighted that we have been able to rescue part of La Senza UK and such a large number of jobs, given the negative economic pressures faced by retailers in the UK.</p> <p>\"Alshaya is a leading international retail operator with longstanding links with the UK as the international franchise partner of a string of high street brands. This deal recognises the value of La Senza as a strong and popular high street brand with a loyal customer base.\"</p>",

Post-Christmas offers brought large numbers of shoppers out but that was generally a shortlived hunt for bargains. \"With discounting driving sales at the expense of margins the key question for retailers is about earnings from those sales.\" The BRC's monthly snapshot of retail activity showed that once allowance had been made for the opening of new stores during 2011, so-called like-for-like sales were 2.2% higher last month than in December 2010. Excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter, both total and like-for-like sales growth in December was the strongest since January 2011. Sales of food picked up in December while cut-price offers boosted non-food spending. Consumers waited until the last minute to do their online shopping, with internet sales showing an 18.5% year-on-year increase last month. The supermarket group Wm Morrison on Monday blamed its own disappointing Christmas performance on an austerity drive by Britons who bought fewer treats and cheaper food and drink for the festivities. Dalton Philips, the chief executive, said it had proved tough for retailers to persuade cautious consumers to part with their cash. \"People were making tough choices this Christmas and trading [down] out of certain products,\" said Philips. He said customers were buying less and had waited until the last minute to stock up on Christmas fare such as mince pies and tins of Quality Street as they stuck to tight budgets. Like-for-like sales at the Bradford-based retailer grew by only 0.7% excluding fuel in the six weeks to 1 January, falling short of City expectations of about 1.3%. The figure represented a slowdown from the 2.4% rise in the previous quarter. Once inflation is taken into account, analysts said the retailer's sales volumes must have declined during the important trading period. Although Morrions attracted an extra 800,000 customers a week over the holiday period, Philips said baskets were getting smaller, with shoppers buying \"one less item\". \"In the mass market, which is UK Inc, people are getting squeezed and buying less,\" he said. Champagne sales volumes were down 7% but sparkling wine up 156%, with cheaper alternatives to turkey such as pork also in demand. Sales in the week of Christmas were 25% higher than two years ago with more than 40% of products on sale at cut prices. \"It's very aggressive out there,\" said Philips. He batted away the unfavourable comparison with Morrisons' upmarket rival Waitrose, which last week reported an increase in like-for-like sales of 3.8% for December, implying that its well-heeled shoppers were insulated from the economic downturn than the Morrisons demographic, seen as the \"most average\" of the major supermarkets. \"We have become slightly accustomed to Morrisons leading the way in like-for-like sales terms, with Sainsbury's behind and Asda and Tesco bringing up the rear,\" said Pritchard. \"This Christmas has seen a shift.\" Given Waitrose's success \u2013 and what is expected to be a strong performance from Marks &amp; Spencer's food businesson Tuesday \u2013 he added: \"It seems that a combination of an upmarket offer with some web exposure and strong advertising has been the key to 'winning' Christmas 2011. We suspect that Morrisons' campaign came across as rather uninspiring.\" Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti-based retail group Alshaya said that it had bought 60 of La Senza's stores, saving 1,100 jobs. A further 84 stores and 16 concessions will close with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Richard Fleming, joint administrator and UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \"We are delighted that we have been able to rescue part of La Senza UK and such a large number of jobs, given the negative economic pressures faced by retailers in the UK. \"Alshaya is a leading international retail operator with longstanding links with the UK as the international franchise partner of a string of high street brands. This deal recognises the value of La Senza as a strong and popular high street brand with a loyal customer base.\"",
