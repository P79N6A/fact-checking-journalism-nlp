      "bodyText": "This week was a prime example of how economics and, by extension, politics doesn\u2019t cope very well with the issue of climate change. The news that Australia economy went backwards in the September quarter was greeted with alarm by politicians and then used as a reason to push their policy barrow. And most of the barrows were piled high with coal. The treasurer and the prime minister in their press conferences on Wednesday made great mention of the need to keep electricity prices low for the economy to grow. Malcolm Turnbull especially was in full Tony Abbott 2010 mode out of a desire to cover the silly back flip on the issue of investigating whether or not to introduce an emissions intensity trading scheme. When asked about the prospect of GDP growth going backwards he immediately responded by suggesting the issue was for Bill Shorten to \u201cexplain why he is proposing to increase the price of electricity\u201d. Never mind that such a scheme would more efficiently price emissions than does the current system, for now we remained trapped in an idiotic netherworld where any mention of pricing carbon (no matter how oblique) must be greeted with shrieks of horror, with the prime minister leading the chorus. And while you do wonder if Malcolm Turnbull ever looks in the mirror in the morning and asks himself how it all came to this \u2013 or whether he first rings Cory Bernardi to ask whether he is allowed to look into the mirror and ask such questions \u2013 the broader issue is that this netherworld is one that inherently sees action on climate change as a negative for the economy. And by contrast, the economic impact of anything that will cause climate change is seen as inherently positive. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, for example, took the decline in the GDP growth as further evidence of why investment in the Adani coal mine was essential. He argued in favour of a $1bn government loan to build the railway from the proposed mine site to Abbot Point port saying \u201cyou need that money to flow. If the loan facilitates this happening or expediting this process then I\u2019ve got no problems with the loan\u201d. The problem is if you loaned any company $1bn to build something it would also get income flowing, and it also would create jobs \u2013 jobs that would not only be less harmful to the environment, but also more likely to exists than the fanciful 10,000 that have been spruiked by both the federal and Queensland governments. Talk of jobs and growth from mining investment or the cost of jobs and growth from pricing carbon always quickly skips past the reason why anyone would actually wish to price carbon or be against a coal mine. Climate change is left to the side of the economic debate \u2013 and especially so under this government. The topic was all but ignored in the 2015 intergenerational report, and any concerns about the impact of the Carmichael mine on the local environment due to water use, or the on the Great Barrier Reef, let alone on the climate, are quickly trammelled by those championing economic growth. The issue is treated similar to how politicians in the past used to flick away suggestions about inequality by arguing that there had to be a trade-off between growth and equality. Now economists realise that equality actually promotes economic growth, and so too are economists realising that climate change must be considered within economic growth \u2013 not as a trade-off, but because the impacts of climate change are so great they must be an essential component of policies geared towards economic growth. Last month a group of economists including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, signed \u201cthe Stockholm Statement\u201d which seeks to guide policymaking. The statement notes as one of its core principles that \u201cEnvironmental Sustainability is a Requirement, Not an Option\u201d. Earlier this month, former chief economist of the World Bank, and also a signatory of the statement, Professor Kaushik Basu, told me that governments when crafting economic policy makers \u201cshould build in right from the start the need to protect the environment to make sure they\u2019re not damaging the climate\u201d. Professor Basu, who has also worked as an advisor to the Indian government, also dismissed suggestions that economies like India need not worry about climate change. He argued that \u201cthere is really no conflict between the interests of the poor and activism on the environmental front\u201d. Indeed he noted that \u201cit is the poor who take the brunt of the bad karma on this \u2013 it hits the poor\u201d. The lack of spine displayed by Malcolm Turnbull this week on carbon pricing and the glee by both the federal and Queensland government towards the Carmichael mine highlight that politics remains wedded to the belief that economic growth trumps concerns of climate change. Unfortunately such thinking only makes the problem worse. Viewing investment in a coal mine as the solution is like a smoker suggesting another cigarette at least will alleviate the nicotine withdrawal. This week the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, argued that \u201cthe life of this project will be anywhere between 50 and 60 years. That means generational jobs.\u201d But given the current trajectory of climate change, those in 60 years will be only shaking their heads in wonder that a politician would be so naive as to talk of economic growth without thinking what that type of growth would do to the planet.",

      "bodyText": "Amazon may be set to bring its hi-tech till-free stores to the UK after registering the Amazon Go brand name in the UK last week. At the test store near Amazon\u2019s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account. The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food. The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced shopping technology\u201d but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The Na\u0308raffa\u0308r convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. They\u2019re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop: Robot assistants Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software. The American DIY chain Lowe\u2019s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. First trialled as OSHbot two years ago, it is currently being tested in 11 Lowe\u2019s stores. US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some Nescaf\u00e9 stores in Japan. Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards \u2013 a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But it\u2019s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy. A virtual you For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned \u2013 which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to \u201ctry on\u201d clothes. Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The company\u2019s technology can be plugged into retailers\u2019 websites so customers can create what it calls \u201cMe Models\u201d as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top. Retailers will also be able to use customer data to suggest outfits, creating a \u201cNetflix style\u201d shopping experience. Digital butlers Doing the shopping may soon require nothing other than a shiny little box. Nearly all the major tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, are developing digital home assistants that respond to voice commands. As an online retailer, it\u2019s not surprising that Amazon has ensured its Echo device is easy to shop with \u2013 thanks to the Alexa app, which lets you shout out a shopping list, to add to a virtual trolley, as you walk around the house. Eventually these assistants should learn what you want and when you want it without commands. But these devices may be very shortlived \u2013 because home appliances like fridges, coffee machines and printers have already been developed that are linked to the internet so they can automatically replenish themselves without any interaction with their owner. Drone deliveries As retail sales increasingly transfer from the high street to the internet, one of the biggest problems for retailers is making deliveries. In busy cities where traffic congestion is a problem, one solution already being tested is using drones. In the summer, Amazon started working with the UK government to test the viability of delivering small parcels \u2013 which make up 90% of Amazon\u2019s sales \u2013 by drone. In the US, Mercedes-Benz is collaborating with drone startup Matternet on the \u201cVision Van\u201d, where a vehicle\u2019s roof doubles as a launch pad for drones capable of sorties of up to 12 miles. Google has also shown off a fixed-wing drone capable of carrying packages. However, beyond the special testing privileges granted to Amazon, current UK legislation bans drones from being flown within 50 metres of a building or a person, or within 150 metres of a built-up area. Aircraft pilots have also expressed concern about the dangers posed by drones after a number of near-misses in London and Manchester.",

      "body": "<p>Amazon may be set to bring its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/amazon-go-stores-uk-trademark-us\">hi-tech till-free stores</a> to the UK after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/amazon-go-stores-uk-trademark-us\">registering the Amazon Go brand name in the UK last week</a>. At the test store near Amazon\u2019s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account.</p> <p>The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food.</p> <p>The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced shopping technology\u201d but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The Na\u0308raffa\u0308r convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. They\u2019re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop:</p> <h2><strong>Robot assistants</strong></h2> <p>Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software.</p> <p>The American DIY chain Lowe\u2019s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/08/robot-shop-assistant\">First trialled as OSHbot two years ago</a>, it is currently being tested in 11 Lowe\u2019s stores.</p> <p>US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some Nescaf\u00e9 stores in Japan.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/robocop-robot-mall-security-guard-palo-alto-california\">Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards</a> \u2013 a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But it\u2019s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy.</p> <h2><strong>A virtual you</strong></h2> <p>For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned \u2013 which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to \u201ctry on\u201d clothes.</p> <p>Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The company\u2019s technology can be plugged into retailers\u2019 websites so customers can create what it calls \u201cMe Models\u201d as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top. Retailers will also be able to use customer data to suggest outfits, creating a \u201cNetflix style\u201d shopping experience.</p> <h2><strong>Digital butlers</strong></h2> <p>Doing the shopping may soon require nothing other than a shiny little box. Nearly all the major tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-home-launch-amazon-echo-voice-recognition-uk-living-rooms\">developing digital home assistants that respond to voice commands</a>. As an online retailer, it\u2019s not surprising that Amazon has ensured its Echo device is easy to shop with \u2013 thanks to the Alexa app, which lets you shout out a shopping list, to add to a virtual trolley, as you walk around the house.</p> <p>Eventually these assistants should learn what you want and when you want it without commands. But these devices may be very shortlived \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/03/samsung-launches-smartthings-internet-of-things-hub\">home appliances like fridges, coffee machines and printers have already been developed that are linked to the internet</a> so they can automatically replenish themselves without any interaction with their owner.</p> <h2><strong>Drone deliveries</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a588b2ed5f7c4ac563a97f29b0893f72a2bb24d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a588b2ed5f7c4ac563a97f29b0893f72a2bb24d/0_163_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A delivery drone with a pizza box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A delivery drone with a pizza box before a test flight in Auckland, New Zealand, earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As retail sales increasingly transfer from the high street to the internet, one of the biggest problems for retailers is making deliveries. In busy cities where traffic congestion is a problem, one solution already being tested is using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/drones-non-military\">drones</a>. In the summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/25/amazon-to-test-drone-delivery-uk-government\">Amazon started working with the UK government</a> to test the viability of delivering small parcels \u2013 which make up 90% of Amazon\u2019s sales \u2013 by drone.</p> <p>In the US, Mercedes-Benz is collaborating with drone startup Matternet on the \u201cVision Van\u201d, where a vehicle\u2019s roof doubles as a launch pad for drones capable of sorties of up to 12 miles. Google has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/20/google-delivery-drone-project-wing\">shown off a fixed-wing drone</a> capable of carrying packages.</p> <p>However, beyond the special testing privileges granted to Amazon, current UK legislation bans drones from being flown within 50 metres of a building or a person, or within 150 metres of a built-up area. Aircraft pilots have also expressed concern about the dangers posed by drones after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/09/two-near-misses-renew-fears-drones-major-air-accident-manchester-london\">a number of near-misses in London and Manchester.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has sent some mixed signals on China. One minute they are \u201craping\u201d America, the next they are his best clients. Even the way he says the word \u2013 and he says it a lot \u2013 seeds confusion. Sometimes the president-elect spits it out like poison, sometimes he exclaims the word as if greeting a favoured child. Whatever his real attitude, those that study the world\u2019s second-largest economy believe US-China relations are in for a rocky time when Trump reaches the White House \u2013 and the global consequences could be dire. Trump excoriated China\u2019s trade policies during his election campaign and succeeded in needling Beijing into threats of retaliation after pledging to whack a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. The president-elect rattled Beijing again earlier this month after taking a call from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen \u2013 the first communication between top officials from the two governments in nearly 40 years. Last week he seemed to be attempting to mend fences, appointing Iowa governor Terry Branstad, \u201can old friend of the Chinese people\u201d according to Beijing officials, as his ambassador to China. But such a signal has not been enough to head off worries of a looming trade war between China and the US that would send shockwaves across the globe. \u201cThe initial signs are not good,\u201d said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California and author of the book China\u2019s Crony Capitalism. The US has recognised Taiwan as part of China since 1979 and its status is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d, said Pei. Branstad is an interesting pick and \u201cshows a gesture that he wants to keep the relationship on an even keel\u201d. But Pei said descriptions of Branstad as a longtime friend of Chinese leader Xi Jinpin were overblown. \u201cThat\u2019s a very American way of describing friendship. Very few Chinese leaders have longtime friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat China really values in an ambassador is not his relationship with them but his relationship with the White House.\u201d Those doing business with the two trading powers will have a lot invested in the pro-trade Branstad\u2019s powers of persuasion. Academic studies have already shown the consequences of political spats with Beijing. In 2010 the University of Gottingen in Germany coined the term \u201cthe Dalai Lama effect\u201d after its study found countries whose top leadership met with Tibet\u2019s exiled spiritual leader lost on average 8.1% in exports to China in the two years following the meeting. The first true test of the Trump White House\u2019s relationship with China may come in April, when the US Treasury releases a report looking at China\u2019s currency. Trump has long maintained that China has been devaluing its currency in order to stack the deck on exports in its favour. \u201cIf he wants to impose tariffs on China, he needs a procedural excuse. He can\u2019t just get into the White House and the next day announce a tariff increase, it wouldn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Pei. Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation are out of date and largely incorrect, according to Pei. In fact, Beijing has been burning through its currency reserves in an attempt to prop up the value of the yuan. \u201cBut for Donald Trump that doesn\u2019t matter. Intellectual rigour is not one of his concerns.\u201d Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics and a former senior China economist at the World Bank, said it was \u201cmore legitimate now than at anytime in the last 10 years to talk about the risk of something pretty close to a trade war\u201d, he said. \u201cAnyone with a stake in Chinese exports, especially to the US, should be worried,\u201d said Kuijs, adding that US and European companies that assemble products in China would also see their bottom lines affected. If a trade war starts, it is likely to start with targeted hits, said Pei. If Trump wants to placate his base in the midwest he could target Chinese steel, for example. China is engaging \u201cin at least questionable\u201d practices in the steel industry, says Pei. \u201cThe industry has so much overcapacity and they are exporting a lot of cheap steel and that is disrupting.\u201d If the moves are small enough, China might chose to ignore them and concentrate on the bigger picture. But past at a certain point, Beijing will retaliate and would likely target large American firms, Boeing or Apple for example, that increasingly rely on China. Both sides have a lot to lose in a trade war. China is currently the US\u2019s largest goods trading partner. Trade between the two was worth $598bn in total during 2015, with US exports to China totalling $116bn and imports totalling $482bn. China has more to lose but the types of goods it sells to the US are harder to source elsewhere. The three largest categories of goods China buys from the US are soybeans, cars and aircraft, all of which China could source from elsewhere. The three largest categories that the US imports from China are mobile phones, tablets/laptops and network equipment. \u201cIn each case, China is the dominant global supplier, producing about 70% of global output. A high tariff would end up as effectively a tax on US purchases of consumer electronics,\u201d Capital Economics\u2019 chief Asia economist wrote in a recent note to investors. Tariffs on those goods would also disrupt trade right across the Asia Pacific region, said Pei. Some 35% of China\u2019s exports in 2015 was \u201cprocessing trade\u201d, where China imports components from other countries and assembles them for exports. A trade war with China on those goods would cause collateral damage on imports from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and others. While both sides would suffer, China\u2019s economy is more reliant on US exports and a serious spat would rock the economy at a time of sluggish growth. Household debt has soared as property prices have increased, and millions of workers are set to lose their jobs as the government seeks to rebalance the economy away from state-led investments. Not all factory owners in China are worried about an upcoming trade war. \u201cTrump\u2019s grandstanding performances during the campaign were for publicity, but he\u2019s a successful businessman and therefore should be very rational in his thinking,\u201d said Sun Sijun, chief executive of Uptop Group in southern China, which exports between $150m-$200m worth of Samsonite suitcases and Walmart shoes to the US every year. \u201cRationally, the basic interests are not to make enemies, and to ultimately not harm yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s talk of increasing tariffs is in the hope of increasing employment in America,\u201d Sun said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a very small probability you can bring these labour-intensive industries back to the US. Labour-intensive industries flowed to third world, and they won\u2019t return to America.\u201d But other producers in China see only dark clouds on the horizon. Chen Yadong also sells to Walmart. His company, Indena, makes computer mice and bluetooth speakers, sending more than 1m mice to the US each year. \u201cI\u2019m extremely worried,\u201d Chen said from the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen in southern China. \u201cThe US is the largest market for export-oriented companies here. If Trump increases tariffs, then this business will become increasingly difficult.\u201d China\u2019s leaders don\u2019t know what to think of Trump quite yet, said Pei. But they do understand the consequences of a trade war. \u201cThe Chinese have a proverb: \u2018you lift a rock only to drop it on your own foot.\u2019\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
