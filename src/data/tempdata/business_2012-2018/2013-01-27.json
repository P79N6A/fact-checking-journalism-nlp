The US coffee chain said it \"remains fully committed to opening 300 new stores and creating 5,000 new jobs by 2016\". Starbucks renewed its commitment to British expansion following reports its UK boss angrily stormed into No 10 Downing Street, after the prime minister appeared to single out the coffee chain during a speech attacking multinational companies' tax avoidance. The Sunday Telegraph said Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK, had threatened to withhold \u00a3100m of investment in the UK if Cameron continued to single out the coffee chain in the tax avoidance debate.

Asked whether Cameron's remarks were aimed at Starbucks, a No 10 spokesman said \"the speech speaks for itself\". Starbucks said Engskov, a former aide to Bill Clinton when he was US president, had \"very constructive\" discussions with Downing Street officials on Friday, but said the meeting was \"long-scheduled\" and not organised in reaction to Cameron's speech. \"We do not discuss the details of our government meetings but can say that we do not recognise how it has been reported [in the Sunday Telegraph],\" he said.

Last week Sach sold out to Hilco, a specialist turnaround investor, for an undisclosed amount. The distressed debt sale is likely to leave the taxpayer-controlled bank recovering only a small part of the face value of loans to HMV.</p> <p>Together with fellow lead lender Lloyds, RBS had breathed life back into the dying DVD to computer games retailer more than three times in two years, waiving loan covenants and softening borrowing terms. A similar pattern of forbearance was shown to Clinton Cards before its failure last May. Such lifelines thrown to ailing companies have been nicknamed \"extend and pretend\" loan agreements by critics.</p> <p>\"HMV is an example of a business challenged by both structural and cyclical factors,\" said Sach. \"The lenders' support over the last two years was designed to provide time for management's strategy to reposition the business to develop.\"</p> <p>A central plank of HMV's strategy had been to combat plunging DVD and CD sales by selling fashionably large headphones and other technology accessories \u2013 a plan viewed with scepticism by many City analysts.</p> <p>\"We do not believe that the move, more aggressively, into portable digital technology will be strong enough to drive footfall and earnings,\" Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said as long ago as September 2011. \"We maintain our 'sell' recommendation as we continue to believe that the business is a value trap and management will struggle to grow profitability.\"</p> <p>Three months earlier, HMV's then chief executive, Simon Fox, was even more candid. He said the business had some way to go before it had a \"full, credible equity\" story for shareholders \u2013 a message he stuck to until he quit last September.</p> <p>Sach accepts HMV's strategy failed but insists good use was made of the time bought by the banks' supportive approach, with non-core divisions within HMV Group sold off in an orderly fashion. Even the failed rump may yet return some value for creditors if administrators can find a buyer in Hilco or another investor.</p> <p>But time is not always on the bank's side. Regulators are growing impatient that some of Britain's largest lenders appear to be failing to conduct realistic valuations of their loans. Such criticisms were set out in stark terms two months ago, in the Bank of England's six-monthly Financial Stability Report.</p> <p>Afterwards, deputy governor Paul Tucker said: \"Banks [have to] have honest balance sheets\u2026 This is a major issue for all top bankers; they have to look at their loan books and say: 'Well, what actually do we think the rate of recovery is going to be?'\"</p> <p>Sach defended RBS valuations. \"We follow all the rules\u2026 and we make provisions when we should, when we know, or think, there's an asset impaired. I would contend we're adequately provided.\"</p> <p>He believes that behind talk of so-called zombie companies there is little appetite for imposing \"violent\" insolvencies as was the case in the 1990s. \"And in a funny sort of way it would be awfully perverse to do that now \u2013 now that we've struggled for five years with this 'letting the air out of the balloon slowly' economic recovery. To suddenly say: 'We'll have a great recession and move forwards\u2026' I don't think it's going to happen,\" he said.</p> <p>Sach admits the length of the economic downturn has surprised him, but he remains confident a recovery will come. \"When we were restructuring these things in 2009 and 2010 everybody anticipated that, by now, the economy would be better than it is\u2026 and it just hasn't happened. Now possibly people are veering too far the other way and assuming it will never get any better.\"</p>",

Such lifelines thrown to ailing companies have been nicknamed \"extend and pretend\" loan agreements by critics. \"HMV is an example of a business challenged by both structural and cyclical factors,\" said Sach. \"The lenders' support over the last two years was designed to provide time for management's strategy to reposition the business to develop.\" A central plank of HMV's strategy had been to combat plunging DVD and CD sales by selling fashionably large headphones and other technology accessories \u2013 a plan viewed with scepticism by many City analysts. \"We do not believe that the move, more aggressively, into portable digital technology will be strong enough to drive footfall and earnings,\" Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said as long ago as September 2011. \"We maintain our 'sell' recommendation as we continue to believe that the business is a value trap and management will struggle to grow profitability.\" Three months earlier, HMV's then chief executive, Simon Fox, was even more candid. He said the business had some way to go before it had a \"full, credible equity\" story for shareholders \u2013 a message he stuck to until he quit last September. Sach accepts HMV's strategy failed but insists good use was made of the time bought by the banks' supportive approach, with non-core divisions within HMV Group sold off in an orderly fashion. Even the failed rump may yet return some value for creditors if administrators can find a buyer in Hilco or another investor. But time is not always on the bank's side. Regulators are growing impatient that some of Britain's largest lenders appear to be failing to conduct realistic valuations of their loans. Such criticisms were set out in stark terms two months ago, in the Bank of England's six-monthly Financial Stability Report. Afterwards, deputy governor Paul Tucker said: \"Banks [have to] have honest balance sheets\u2026 This is a major issue for all top bankers; they have to look at their loan books and say: 'Well, what actually do we think the rate of recovery is going to be?'\" Sach defended RBS valuations. \"We follow all the rules\u2026 and we make provisions when we should, when we know, or think, there's an asset impaired. I would contend we're adequately provided.\" He believes that behind talk of so-called zombie companies there is little appetite for imposing \"violent\" insolvencies as was the case in the 1990s. \"And in a funny sort of way it would be awfully perverse to do that now \u2013 now that we've struggled for five years with this 'letting the air out of the balloon slowly' economic recovery. To suddenly say: 'We'll have a great recession and move forwards\u2026' I don't think it's going to happen,\" he said. Sach admits the length of the economic downturn has surprised him, but he remains confident a recovery will come. \"When we were restructuring these things in 2009 and 2010 everybody anticipated that, by now, the economy would be better than it is\u2026 and it just hasn't happened. Now possibly people are veering too far the other way and assuming it will never get any better.\"",

      "bodyText": "Imagine that you could construct the ultimate Davos panel. From the annals of history you can choose any quartet that could put the world to rights in an hour-long talk, the format beloved of the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab, the man who has been organising the forum since 1971, ensured there were plenty of stellar names strutting their stuff in the high Alps last week. Davos attendees could watch Nouriel \"Dr Doom\" Roubini cross swords with Adam Posen, recently a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee about the merits of quantitative easing. They could listen to Mark Carney, soon to take over from Sir Mervyn King at Threadneedle Street, warn that the global economy is far from out of the woods. George Soros held forth on drugs; Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg spoke passionately about sexual stereotyping; David Cameron called for the G8 to act against tax avoidance and corruption. But how about this for a panel? Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman and Fritz Schumacher, all no longer with us, kept in line by the IMF's Christine Lagarde, thankfully still alive and kicking, and one of the standout performers last week. Lagarde kicks off our fantasy discussion with a few words of introduction. She says business leaders have left Davos in a slightly better frame of mind not because of the millions of words spouted in Davos, but because of three little words spoken by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, in London in July. Those words were \"whatever it takes\", a commitment by the ECB to buy up the bonds of troubled eurozone countries in unlimited quantities. That has removed one of the big tail risks to the global economy \u2013 a chaotic break-up of the eurozone. But, she adds, any recovery in 2013 will be fragile and timid, and there is a risk of a relapse. \"Turning first to you Karl, how do you see things\". Marx: \"The capitalist class gathered in Davos has spent the last few days wringing their hands about unemployment and the lack of demand for their goods. What they seem incapable of recognising is that these are inevitable in a globalised economy. There is a tendency towards over-investment, over-production and a falling rate of profit, which, as ever, employers have sought to counter by cutting wages and creating a reserve army of labour. That's why there are more than 200 million people unemployed around the world and there has been a trend towards greater inequality. It is possible that 2013 will be better than 2012 but it will be a brief respite.\" Lagarde: \"That's a gloomy analysis, Karl. Wages are growing quite fast in some parts of the world, such as China, but I'd agree that inequality is a threat. The IMF's own research shows that inequality is correlated to economic instability.\" Marx: \"It is true that the emerging market economies are growing rapidly now but in time they too will be affected by the same forces.\" Lagarde: \"Maynard, do you think things are as bleak as Karl says? Keynes: \"No I don't Christine. I think the problem is serious but soluble. When we last faced a crisis of this magnitude we responded by aggressive loosening of monetary policy \u2013 driving down both short-term and long-term interest rates \u2013 and by the use of public works to boost aggregate demand. In the US, my friend Franklin Roosevelt supported legislation that allowed workers to organise. After the second world war, the international community created the IMF in order to smooth out balance of payments imbalances, prevent beggar-my-neighbour currency wars and control movements of capital. All these lessons have been forgotten. The balance between fiscal and monetary policy is wrong; currency wars are brewing; the financial sector remains largely unreformed, and aggregate demand is weak because workers are not getting a fair share of their productivity gains. Economics is stuck in the past; it is as if physics had not moved on since Kepler.\" Lagarde: \"I gather from what you are saying, Maynard, that you do not approve of the way George Osborne is running the UK economy.\" Keynes: \"The man has taken leave of his senses. Britain has a growth problem, not a deficit problem.\" Lagarde: \"I daresay Milton that you disagree with everything Maynard has said? You would make the case, presumably, for nature's cure?\" Milton Friedman: \"Some of my friends in the Austrian school of economics would certainly favour doing nothing in the hope of a cleansing of the system, but I wouldn't. Unlike Maynard, I wouldn't support measures that would increase the bargaining power of trade unions and I've never been keen on public works as a response to a slump. \"But I would certainly support what Ben Bernanke has been doing with monetary policy in the US and would support even more drastic action if it proved necessary.\" Lagarde: \"Such as?\" Friedman: \"Well, I think monetary policy should be set in order to hit a target for nominal output \u2013 the increase in the size of the economy unadjusted for inflation. If that growth is too high, central banks should tighten policy. If it is too low, the trend since the crisis broke, they should loosen it. In extreme circumstances, I'd favour policies that blur the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. That's what I mean when I talk about helicopter drops of money into the economy.\" Lagarde: \"Fritz, you have been sitting there patiently listening to Karl, Maynard and Milton. How do you assess the state of the world? Fritz Schumacher: \"I am greatly disturbed by the way the debate is being framed. There is an obsession with growth at all costs regardless of the environmental costs. Climate change was rarely mentioned in Davos: this after a year of extreme weather events. It is frightening that so little attention has been paid to global warming, and almost criminally neglectful of governments not to use ultra-low interest rates to invest in green technologies. \"As has been the case in the past, recessions have pushed green issues down the political agenda. In good times policymakers say they are in favour of sustainable development, but the pledges are forgotten as soon as unemployment starts to rise. Then it is back to business as usual: more roads, expanding airports, tax cuts to encourage consumption. When scientists are warning that global temperatures are on course to rise several degrees above pre-industrial levels on unchanged policies, this is the economics of the madhouse.\" Lagarde: \"Maynard, what's your response to that?\" Keynes: \"I agree with him. If I were advising Roosevelt today I would be calling for a Green New Deal. I find it hard to envisage a world without growth, something that is politically unacceptable in the developing world in any case. But Fritz is right, we need smarter, cleaner growth. As you yourself said last week, Christine, if we carry on as we are the next generation will be 'roasted, toasted, fried and grilled'.\" Schumacher: \"I couldn't have put it better myself.\"",

      "body": "<p>Imagine that you could construct the ultimate Davos panel. From the annals of history you can choose any quartet that could put the world to rights in an hour-long talk, the format beloved of the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>Klaus Schwab, the man who has been organising the forum since 1971, ensured there were plenty of stellar names strutting their stuff in the high Alps last week. Davos attendees could watch Nouriel \"Dr Doom\" Roubini cross swords with Adam Posen, recently a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee about the merits of quantitative easing. They could listen to Mark Carney, soon to take over from Sir Mervyn King at Threadneedle Street, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/26/mark-carney-bank-england\" title=\"\">warn that the global economy is far from out of the woods</a>.

Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman and Fritz Schumacher, all no longer with us, kept in line by the IMF's Christine Lagarde, thankfully still alive and kicking, and one of the standout performers last week.</p> <p>Lagarde kicks off our fantasy discussion with a few words of introduction. She says business leaders have left Davos in a slightly better frame of mind not because of the millions of words spouted in Davos, but because of three little words spoken by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, in London in July. Those words were \"whatever it takes\", a commitment by the ECB to buy up the bonds of troubled eurozone countries in unlimited quantities. That has removed one of the big tail risks to the global economy \u2013 a chaotic break-up of the eurozone. But, she adds, any recovery in 2013 will be fragile and timid, and there is a risk of a relapse. \"Turning first to you Karl, how do you see things\".</p> <p><strong>Marx:</strong> \"The capitalist class gathered in Davos has spent the last few days wringing their hands about unemployment and the lack of demand for their goods.

    "webTitle": "Mothercare tries to sharpen up and cash in on baby boom", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Was it something in the water or simply a cheap form of entertainment? Who knows, but the UK is experiencing its biggest baby boom since 1971. The Office for National Statistics said last week that 723,913 babies were born in 2011, with hotspots in the south-east of England seeing birth rates up by more than 50%. If that seems like joyful news for our depressed nation, imagine how pleased you would be if your livelihood depended on it. A combination of booming birth rate and women earning higher salaries before they become mothers has seen sales of baby products soar. The town of Watford in Hertfordshire is one of the baby-boom capitals \u2013 with birth rates up 44% in 10 years \u2013 and also happens to be the headquarters of Mothercare. You might expect the mother-and-baby retailer to be riding high, yet in a seemingly recession-proof market, it is losing market share to the likes of Tesco and Asda at one end, and upmarket boutiques such as Petit Bateau and JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9 at the other. Honor Westnedge of retail analyst Verdict says: \"We've seen the average age of first-time mothers increase, and older mothers tend to spend more on their children because they have more disposable income. Nothing is too good for their baby.\" The number of first-time mothers aged over 35 has jumped by 44% over the past 10 years, with those over 40 up 84%. Average spending in infantswear has gone up over the same period from \u00a3334 a child in 2002 to \u00a3435 in 2012. With the market now worth \u00a31.4bn a year, it's no wonder supermarkets are increasing their ranges of bibs, vests and outfits. Westnedge says: \"Supermarkets have worked really hard to sell an affordable product that is also good quality. The quality part is really important, because then parents will continue shopping for clothes there as their children grow.\" Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's have all increased their market share, with Asda now on 8.8%, compared with 7.5% in 2007. But they are taking customers away from midmarket rivals, with Mothercare particularly affected. The baby specialist retailer has had a disastrous few years which has led to depressing predictions from retail analysts. Westnedge says: \"The biggest losers are in the midmarket as people trade down for value or trade up for a treat. Mothercare perceives itself as the go-to destination, but has had lots of trouble with driving footfall because of pricing, store layout and service.\" Babywear \"treats\", sold by high-end retailers such as Mamas &amp; Papas, have a market share of 4.5%, which is expected to increase. Mothercare's overall share of the childrenswear market has fallen, according to Verdict, from 2.9% in 2007 to 2.5% in 2012. But it is hatching a plan. A year ago Mothercare poached Simon Calver from film website LoveFilm as its new chief executive, with a nod to its online ambitions. Calver will also take the axe to many of Mothercare's high street stores, focusing on out-of-town shopping centres, where a trip can be a day out. Its flagship store in Edmonton, north London, now boasts a Costa Coffee shop, private ultrasound service and baby and toddler activities. Back at the Watford branch, a similar transformation is under way, although customers say it still looks more overpriced and dowdy than fresh and affordable. Shopping for a blanket for six-week old Isabel-Maria, Liz Grey says she feels Mothercare has improved. The mother of six, whose oldest is 17, says: \"It is much better now than it was in the 1990s: they've worked hard on customer service, although it still seems overpriced. I remember when the stores were not very baby-friendly, with changing rooms up flights of stairs, and lifts broken.\" Other customers agree. Bridget Gavin, there with granddaughter Tulisa, says: \"We bought a blackboard from here and it was faulty. The store couldn't have been more helpful. They sent me vouchers and I got a phone call of apology from the store manager. That's why I still shop here.\" However, she admit she buys babygrows from Tesco and Asda because they are cheaper. Emma McCarthy, shopping with six-month-old Sophie and four-year-old Thomas, adds: \"I tend to go to the supermarkets because the quality is always fine. It's just too expensive here.\" Joanne Geere, with 10-month-old son Henry, says: \"I bought my babyseat from here. Why should I give my money to Amazon when they don't pay any tax? It we don't support local shops we'll lose them. It's important to get out of the house, and you get the advice and expertise you don't get from a website.\" Mothercare seems to be taking this on board: its customer service satisfaction levels, once around 50%, are now improving. And with parents sometimes spending more than \u00a31,000 on a buggy, advice from knowledgeable staff is more important than ever. This is making even online retailers think again. Kiddicare, one of the biggest online specialists, recently opened four stores and plans several more. Westnedge at Verdict says this is unique to the baby and child sector: \"I can't think of anyone else that has opened stores from an internet-only position.\" Service is expected to be the key factor for any midmarket retailer in this competitive sector, given the squeeze from value brands such as Primark as well as supermarkets. In 2007 value retailers accounted for 47% of childrenswear sales, and the midmarket 48.6%. Today the latter control just 41.7%, while the likes of Tesco and Asda holding a 53.8% share, which is expected to rise.",

Kiddicare, one of the biggest online specialists, recently opened four stores and plans several more.</p> <p>Westnedge at Verdict says this is unique to the baby and child sector: \"I can't think of anyone else that has opened stores from an internet-only position.\"</p> <p>Service is expected to be the key factor for any midmarket retailer in this competitive sector, given the squeeze from value brands such as Primark as well as supermarkets. In 2007 value retailers accounted for 47% of childrenswear sales, and the midmarket 48.6%. Today the latter control just 41.7%, while the likes of Tesco and Asda holding a 53.8% share, which is expected to rise.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Judging by the heavy concentration of floor-length fur coats, eye-watering perfume and expensively tailored suits alone, life had changed little for the wealthy global elite gathered in the Alpine ski resort of Davos for this year's World Economic Forum: being extremely rich is as much fun as it ever was. Yet away from the parties, the mood was oddly becalmed. With the euro crisis stabilised for the moment, and the darkest days of the credit crunch passing into history, there was no fin-de-si\u00e8cle feeling that the familiar comforts of the 1% might be swept away. But with a sustainable recovery still eluding the western economies, battle-hardened business leaders, bankers and politicians are warily scanning the horizon for the source of the next crisis \u2013 or, for those of a more optimistic turn of mind, a new Big Idea to catapult them back to the more carefree days before 2008. These were some of the most talked-about issues at Davos this year. CURRENCY WARS George Soros, who has now retired from investing (though he admitted he still has the odd flutter to keep his hand in), held court at a convivial dinner on Thursday night, and shared his fear that the calm that has prevailed in foreign exchange markets will give way to turmoil in 2013. The Bank of Japan has caved in to pressure from Shinzo Abe's new government in Tokyo to double its inflation target and ramp up quantitative easing, which should drive down the yen and improve Japan's competitiveness. But one currency can fall only if another rises, and Soros believes a cheaper yen will create severe problems for the eurozone. If the euro rises sharply, he said, \"recession in Europe may also affect Germany\". In her appearance at Davos, Angela Merkel admitted that she was \"not unconcerned\" about Japan's move. \"Currencies have been incredibly stable for the past few years; there's now the possibility of fireworks,\" said Soros, who is most famous for creating fireworks of his own when he shorted the pound in September 1992, helping to drive Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism. FRACKING The process of extracting shale gas from rocks deep beneath the earth by blasting chemicals into the ground may be extremely controversial with campaigners, but governments are increasingly pinning their hopes on the fuel as a low-cost energy source, releasing them from dependence on the volatile Middle East. Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, took the opportunity of his sojourn in Davos to sign a multibillion-dollar deal to throw open his country's reserves to Royal Dutch Shell. However, despite George Osborne's hopes of stoking a shale-fired British energy revolution by announcing a new tax regime for the fuel, Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, warned that shale would not be a \"game-changer\" for the UK, adding that it might be a decade before the first gas is extracted. THE BRITISH PROBLEM David Cameron's long-awaited Europe speech, delivered in London before he flew to the Alps, was a hot topic in the hotel bars and conference centre corridors at Davos. Publicly, most of the European leaders attending, not least Merkel, were studiedly diplomatic, but away from the stage, many non-Brits were baffled by Britain's fraught relationship with its neighbours. \"My wife's French: she can't understand it at all,\" said one chief executive. \"She says, why do the British hate us?\" ZOMBIE BUSINESSES An army of the undead is marching through the crisis-hit economies of the western world \u2013 or that was the alarming picture painted by Nouriel Roubini, the outspoken New York-based economist. Five years after the Great Recession ripped through the global economy, the radical emergency measures implemented by the world's central banks have started to become the norm. While their actions may have prevented a new Great Depression, central banks are now stuck in a bind: they don't know when it will be safe to start reversing their policy of quantitative easing without unleashing rising economic chaos. And meanwhile, many thousands of financially shaky banks, businesses and households are being propped up. These are the \"zombies\". Cheap borrowing prevents uneconomic firms from going bust, but they can't invest or expand because they're still hamstrung by the debts of the boom years. Homeowners can't move because they're saddled with mortgages they can't afford; banks won't lend because of the holes in their balance sheets; and the result is long-term stagnation. Central bankers are much in need of another Davos buzz phrase, an \"exit strategy\", but few in the mountain retreat were willing to offer one. MANUFACTURING Boosting the long-neglected manufacturing sector is suddenly in vogue, even in such countries as the US and the UK, where deindustrialisation was for many years seen as a badge of economic progress. Davos attendees were treated to a mind-boggling description of how manufacturing is being transformed for the 21st century, including (literally) weaving components for aircraft engines from carbon fibre on purpose-built looms, and using 3D printers to execute designs for anything from medicines to car parts. Boris Johnson, speaking to British business leaders, argued that manufacturing could be a key growth area for Britain. \"Why,\" he asked, \"should not we partially reindustrialise our economy?\" UNEMPLOYMENT Trade unionists and workers' rights campaigners in Davos had a weary, faintly disbelieving air: they can't understand why rocketing youth unemployment hasn't forced politicians to change tack on austerity. Guy Ryder, the new secretary-general of the International Labour Organisation, said: \"How can these levels of youth unemployment not be a threat to social stability? You have got whole countries reaching a state of immobilisation and trauma.\" Gordon Brown, in Davos to promote global education, warned that young people in emerging countries, with growing access to technology and knowledge about the world, could increasingly start to demand a fairer share of its resources. \"We are in a new world where young people are no longer prepared to say politely, 'I think we have got a case',\" he said. \"This is about economic as well as social change, and I think people are recognising that the world economy is not well-coordinated; that we could grow more effectively if the major economies worked better together.\" RUSSIA With President Vladimir Putin's regime taking ever closer control over what the communist party used to call the \"commanding heights\" of the economy, and anecdotal evidence of corruption and repression, a potential meltdown in Russia is one of the key concerns of global businesses. An apocalyptic document called Scenarios for the Russian Federation, produced by the World Economic Forum, came with an online animation including images of pole-axed Russian dolls. Its message was that falling oil prices risked creating \"a crisis in Russia's economic foundations that threatens the country's social stability\". Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev sat impassively in the audience of one session where a straw poll showed that 78% of the audience thought improving governance \u2013 including tackling corruption \u2013 was the most important issue facing Russia. When his turn came to speak, he insisted reforms were already taking place. \"I knew that most people at Davos would vote that way,\" he said. \"I voted for another option.\" ETHICS Few of the champagne-swilling revellers in the bars of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re hotel, where most of Davos's hottest parties are held, appeared stricken with guilt, but at the more sober daytime events there was a general acknowledgement that businesses need to do (a bit) more to show that they're good for the societies in which they operate. Boosting \"transparency\" and tightening up the rules on footloose global businesses will be one of the aims of Britain's G8 presidency, said David Cameron in his set-piece speech at Davos. A plethora of NGOs, there to launch a major anti-hunger campaign called \"If\", jumped on the prime minister's promise to ensure that corporations pay their fair share of tax. SLOW THINKING Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman offered attendees a crash course in his hit book Thinking, Fast and Slow. He encouraged his audience of top-flight business leaders to try to use what he calls the \"system two\" part of their minds, which makes slower, more considered judgments, rather than relying on instinctive, fast-and-furious \"system one\" thinking. But as one US attendee mused pessimistically afterwards: \"Maybe human beings are hard-wired to jump to conclusions.\" TECHNOLOGY Davos types love nothing better than trying to imagine how the latest whizzy gadget will transform the world. TK Kurien, chief executive of IT at Wipro, the Bangalore technology business that employs 135,000 people worldwide, says his research shows the average person in India comes into contact with some kind of electronic device \u2013 from movement sensors in light switches to their own smartphones \u2013 as many as 11,000 times a day. \"They've embedded ourselves in every part of our life.\" He believes managing the data gathered from these \"touch points\" will become a growing global issue. Eventually, he believes, firms such as Facebook and Twitter, whose business model depends on the detailed information they can give advertisers about their users, may end up sharing some of their revenue with those members to persuade them to keep sharing details: \"Everybody hates being exploited; but nobody minds participating in the entire process and sharing the wealth.\"",

      "body": "<p>Lloyd Blankfein, the boss of Goldman Sachs, is unrepentant about plans \u2013 now dropped \u2013 to help the bank's already highly paid traders avoid paying the top rate of income tax. To recap, Goldman had been thinking about deferring part-payment of bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011 into the new tax year to help recipients benefit from a fall in the top rate of tax from 50% to 45%.</p> <p>The firm surrendered only after Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said he found the idea \"depressing\" and Treasury minister Sajid Javid quietly intervened.</p> <p>There is, of course, nothing illegal about moving payments beyond 6&#xa0;April, when the new tax year begins, but there is a question about whether it can be justified morally.</p> <p>On the BBC's <em>Today</em> programme, Blankfein gave it a go: \"I'm not saying that you are exculpated from any pressure merely because you meet the rule of law \u2013 we've never said that, we don't live that life. But I would say: are you going to hold people up to public opprobrium because a house they could have sold in January instead they sell in May, because there was a profit to be made on that house because the selling price was higher than the purchase price? If you do that, you are going to criminalise every right-thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way.\"</p> <p>Blankfein should be embarrassed if that is the best argument he can muster. Not only is his analogy kooky, but investment banks are supposed to be holding themselves to higher standards as recompense for their role in creating the crisis. Few would consider assisting tax avoidance among your army of wealthy bankers \u2013 who already take home more than the \u00a3150,000 at which the top rate of tax kicks in \u2013 constitutes decent behaviour.</p> <p>Goldman is by no means alone, however, in having thought about deferring bonuses. London-based insurance broker Aon is moving its bonus payments by a month to allow 250 of its staff to pay a lower rate of tax. Rival Willis is thinking about it. All the big-name firms will no doubt have contemplated the idea \u2013 and then quickly backed off after recalling the storm created by the revelation of just how little UK tax coffee chain Starbucks pays.</p> <p>David Cameron had Starbucks in mind when he stood up in Davos and said companies needed to \"<a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jan/24/david-cameron-starbucks-focus-tax\" title=\"\">wake up and smell the coffee</a>, because the customers who buy from them have had enough\". In 14 years Starbucks has paid just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax. And the chain's solution \u2013 to volunteer to pay \u00a320m in the next two years \u2013 made a mockery of the system.</p> <p>There is, in fact, much more the government can do. First, giving a year's notice of a change to tax \u2013 apparently in the name of transparency \u2013 should not happen again. It gives companies too much time to think ahead.</p> <p>Second, the tax specialists at the likes of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and Deloitte \u2013 all of whom have been called before the public accounts committee this week \u2013 should be forced to think about the advice they give to companies when it comes to \"tax planning\". The advice should comply not just with the letter of the law but the spirit too. That line was written into the tax code signed by the major banks in 2010. It has taken time, but in the next fortnight Barclays is expected to finally pull back from the structured capital markets business that helped customers avoid tax, perfectly legally, on a large scale.</p> <p>Third, the government should seize upon <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/22/companies-come-clean-tax-dodges-bonuses\" title=\"\">an idea raised by the corporate governance body Pirc</a> last week when it wrote to remuneration consultants to ask them what advice they have been giving about deferring bonuses. Crucially, Pirc suggested the consultants should advise clients to disclose any such wheezes in annual voluntary reports. Vince Cable, who is pushing through changes to the way directors' pay is disclosed, should grasp this idea.</p> <p>Embarrassment forced Goldman to reconsider its deferral plan. Being forced to admit to tax schemes for staff in annual reports may well prove to be an effective deterrent for others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403057343\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2013/1/25/1359143733166/Dave-Simonds-cartoon-on-S-009.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Simonds cartoon on Sir Stuart Rose joining Ocado\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave Simonds cartoon on Sir Stuart Rose joining Ocado Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rose \u2013 a classy substitution?</h2> <p>'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.\" So said Warren Buffett, who knows a thing or two about successful businesses, as well as pithy observations.</p> <p>Clive Black of Shore Capital isn't quite in that class, but was making the same point last week when welcoming back Sir Stuart Rose to the City, as the former Marks &amp; Spencer boss became chairman of online grocer Ocado.</p> <p>\"The evidence tends to suggest that bad companies will always beat good management,\" Black said. \"To use a footballing analogy, this appointment has the feel of Harry Redknapp joining QPR from Tottenham Hotspurs [sic].\"</p> <p>Like Redknapp, Rose is fun to listen to, infectiously positive and knows his subject.

      "bodyText": "Lloyd Blankfein, the boss of Goldman Sachs, is unrepentant about plans \u2013 now dropped \u2013 to help the bank's already highly paid traders avoid paying the top rate of income tax. To recap, Goldman had been thinking about deferring part-payment of bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011 into the new tax year to help recipients benefit from a fall in the top rate of tax from 50% to 45%. The firm surrendered only after Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said he found the idea \"depressing\" and Treasury minister Sajid Javid quietly intervened. There is, of course, nothing illegal about moving payments beyond 6 April, when the new tax year begins, but there is a question about whether it can be justified morally. On the BBC's Today programme, Blankfein gave it a go: \"I'm not saying that you are exculpated from any pressure merely because you meet the rule of law \u2013 we've never said that, we don't live that life. But I would say: are you going to hold people up to public opprobrium because a house they could have sold in January instead they sell in May, because there was a profit to be made on that house because the selling price was higher than the purchase price? If you do that, you are going to criminalise every right-thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way.\" Blankfein should be embarrassed if that is the best argument he can muster. Not only is his analogy kooky, but investment banks are supposed to be holding themselves to higher standards as recompense for their role in creating the crisis. Few would consider assisting tax avoidance among your army of wealthy bankers \u2013 who already take home more than the \u00a3150,000 at which the top rate of tax kicks in \u2013 constitutes decent behaviour. Goldman is by no means alone, however, in having thought about deferring bonuses. London-based insurance broker Aon is moving its bonus payments by a month to allow 250 of its staff to pay a lower rate of tax. Rival Willis is thinking about it. All the big-name firms will no doubt have contemplated the idea \u2013 and then quickly backed off after recalling the storm created by the revelation of just how little UK tax coffee chain Starbucks pays. David Cameron had Starbucks in mind when he stood up in Davos and said companies needed to \"wake up and smell the coffee, because the customers who buy from them have had enough\". In 14 years Starbucks has paid just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax. And the chain's solution \u2013 to volunteer to pay \u00a320m in the next two years \u2013 made a mockery of the system. There is, in fact, much more the government can do. First, giving a year's notice of a change to tax \u2013 apparently in the name of transparency \u2013 should not happen again. It gives companies too much time to think ahead. Second, the tax specialists at the likes of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and Deloitte \u2013 all of whom have been called before the public accounts committee this week \u2013 should be forced to think about the advice they give to companies when it comes to \"tax planning\". The advice should comply not just with the letter of the law but the spirit too. That line was written into the tax code signed by the major banks in 2010. It has taken time, but in the next fortnight Barclays is expected to finally pull back from the structured capital markets business that helped customers avoid tax, perfectly legally, on a large scale. Third, the government should seize upon an idea raised by the corporate governance body Pirc last week when it wrote to remuneration consultants to ask them what advice they have been giving about deferring bonuses. Crucially, Pirc suggested the consultants should advise clients to disclose any such wheezes in annual voluntary reports. Vince Cable, who is pushing through changes to the way directors' pay is disclosed, should grasp this idea. Embarrassment forced Goldman to reconsider its deferral plan. Being forced to admit to tax schemes for staff in annual reports may well prove to be an effective deterrent for others. Rose \u2013 a classy substitution? 'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.\" So said Warren Buffett, who knows a thing or two about successful businesses, as well as pithy observations. Clive Black of Shore Capital isn't quite in that class, but was making the same point last week when welcoming back Sir Stuart Rose to the City, as the former Marks &amp; Spencer boss became chairman of online grocer Ocado. \"The evidence tends to suggest that bad companies will always beat good management,\" Black said. \"To use a footballing analogy, this appointment has the feel of Harry Redknapp joining QPR from Tottenham Hotspurs [sic].\" Like Redknapp, Rose is fun to listen to, infectiously positive and knows his subject. The pair also both have the reputation of being able to do a deal, with Rose boasting a record of selling retailers at top prices. Still, bookmaker Paddy Power reckons there's only a slightly better chance of Ocado's shares rising this year than bottom-of-the-table QPR surviving relegation. Founded in 2002, and now possessing the potential for yearly sales of almost \u00a3700m, Ocado is yet to make a profit. Some decade it could do so. Rose is making that punt. After Bumi's bust-up with Nat, that billion is still missing \u2026 Another week, another war between the financier Nat Rothschild and Bumi, the mining group he founded with Indonesia's Bakrie family. Last week the company finally published extracts of a report into alleged financial improprieties within its businesses, which after four months of work uncovered only \"circumstantial evidence\" to support the allegations. So instead, the coal miner's board turned on the financier and accused him of obstructing a law firm's inquiry into at least $1bn (\u00a3630m) of missing funds. Unlike Bumi's embattled shareholders, that seems rather rich. There is no doubt that there is plenty of criticism that can be levelled at Rothschild over this whole saga, not least because he was the man who floated Bumi \u2013 thereby leading institutional investors into a disastrous deal in an emerging market with a powerful family he barely knew. But as the insults fly, it is getting increasingly easy to forget that a lot of money has gone missing and that, now he's no longer on the board, it is not really Rothschild's job to find out where it went. Despite employing a law firm whose website brags that its \"excellent track-record\" assists regulators to \"close the file\", we are no nearer discovering what happened. Meanwhile Barry Donnelly, the Macfarlanes partner who was leading the investigation at its inception, was no longer in that position by the time the report was published. There may be a perfectly reasonable explanation for this switch, but Macfarlanes, Bumi and Donnelly all decline to explain what that is. Now Bumi intends to take legal action to recover lost assets and to work with the Serious Fraud Office and the Indonesian authorities. So the saga \u2013 and presumably the insults \u2013 roll on.

      "bodyText": "The outgoing governor of the Bank of England indulges in thinly disguised criticism of the views of his nominated successor, the Canadian Mark Carney. A former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee \u2013 the American Adam Posen \u2013 conducts a manifestly undisguised assault on the centralised way in which Sir Mervyn King allegedly runs the Bank, having already on many occasions differed from him on policy. And Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, says that Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, is \"perhaps right\" in forecasting the demise of that fashionable financial panacea of recent decades \u2013 central bank independence. Weidmann cites political interference with the independence of the Bank of Japan, among others. Yes, central banks are under attack: and central bankers are taking pot-shots at one another. King, who did more than any other British official to promulgate the adoption of \"inflation-targeting\", made an impassioned plea last week for its preservation, including, in his speech in Belfast, a history of all those inflationary problems of the 1970s, and the long struggle to bring inflation down to tolerable rates. In saying \"tolerable\" I am begging the question; but economic history shows that a moderate amount of inflation is a necessary condition for growth. Rip-roaring inflation is certainly not, and is socially destructive as well. But deflation \u2013 falling prices \u2013 is inimical to growth, as the recent experience of Japan has demonstrated. In recent years King's position has been an Augustinian one: the necessity of announcing inflation targets, but the desirability of not hitting them too soon, if at all. By contrast, Carney has revived the idea of a target for nominal gross domestic product, a measure that is the sum of inflation and real growth. People seem to have forgotten that, under chancellor Nigel Lawson, the Thatcher government tried targeting \"money GDP\" with pretty poor results. Carney could do well to study that excellent book The Economy Under Mrs Thatcher, 1979-1990, by the economist Christopher Johnson (who, sadly, died just before Christmas). As Johnson wrote, with the money supply statistics all over the place, \"the use of money GDP created further confusion and was ineffective in controlling either real growth or inflation\". Another book worthy of Carney's attention is Inside The Bank of England: Memoirs of Christopher Dow, Chief Economist 1973-84, which has been long delayed, but whose publication last week turns out to be well timed. Dow, who was on the frontlines when inflation was serious (25% in 1975) kept a diary \u2013 against the wishes of the governor of the time, Gordon Richardson, who, I am pretty certain, would have granted him a posthumous pardon if he had read this remarkable book. (That is, if they are not already discussing it up there in the great central bankers' resting parlour in the sky.) Richardson was governor from 1973 to 1983. He arrived at the Bank shortly after Dow had been appointed by the previous governor, Leslie O'Brien, and worked closely with Dow throughout, one of the latter's self-appointed tasks being to try to keep Richardson's flirtations with monetarism, and concerns about public sector borrowing, within reasonable bounds. In their introduction to the memoirs, the economists Graham Hacche and Christopher Taylor, who worked for Dow, note that \"the main worries for UK watchers when Dow entered the Bank were slower trend productivity growth than in other major economies, persistent balance of payment problems, and an upward trend in inflation\". Plus \u00e7a change, although, as noted, inflation then was in another league. But, as now, it was a time of economic crisis \u2013 welcome to the party, Mr Carney \u2013 and, in addition to concerns about economic policy, Richardson and Dow spent much of their time trying to reform the Bank, a task which, the chancellor and the Treasury have made no secret about, is due to be embarked upon all over again under the leadership of Carney. In a foreword to the book, Sir Kit McMahon, former deputy governor, says of the Bank in the mid-1970s: \"The Bank's organisation was ancient and creaking.\" Not to put too fine a point upon it, that is what the Treasury thought when appointing Carney. But if the Treasury thinks that by tinkering with monetary policy Carney will help it out of a fiscal hole, it may have another think coming. A sound Keynesian, Dow thought that the management of aggregate demand, with the object of maintaining high output and employment, depended mainly on fiscal policy. A contractionary fiscal policy \u2013 especially one of trying to cut the deficit at a time of depression \u2013 is hardly calculated to bring us out of depression, as a succession of GDP figures, including the latest 0.3% decline, have shown. Thus, as Gordon Brown wrote recently in an article for Reuters: \"The policy void today lies less in the weaknesses of national central bank leadership than in the reluctance of national governments to contemplate global leadership.\" Brown demonstrated such leadership in 2008-09, both in his contribution to the rescue of the banking system and in coordinating the G20 economic stimulus in April 2009. Then came the austerity merchants, to, literally, devastating effect.",

      "body": "<p>For the sake of balance, there was a token man: Kevin Kelly, the chief executive of headhunter Heidrick &amp; Struggles, sat alongside six high-powered female panellists in Davos on Friday to discuss \"women in economic decision-making\".</p> <p>The Alpine networking event has frequently been criticised as overwhelmingly male-dominated, reflecting the imbalance at the top levels of global business and politics: despite the fact that attendees are allowed to bring their partners (who wear a special spouse badge), the atmosphere retains a whiff of the old boys' club.</p> <p>The World Economic Forum has tried to boost the number of women on delegations by offering companies an extra place if they bring a woman along; but many events still have all-male panels, and any female selected must pass the WEF's strict criteria about seniority. \"Lots of firms just don't have a woman senior enough to send,\" shrugged one female Davos veteran. And once there, many find themselves shut out of the highest-level, closed door meetings by what another female delegate described as a \"caste system\".</p> <p>Perhaps for that reason, there are several networking events for members of the sisterhood who want to compare notes. At the Schatzalp hotel on Friday evening, high up in the mountains above the twinkling lights of the resort, a high-powered group of women gathered for a champagne reception, swapping business cards and anecdotes. The host, Anne Finucane, Bank of America's global strategy and marketing officer and a member of its board, said it wasn't about huddling together for solidarity but \"problem-solving\".</p> <p>Earlier in the day, for the women-in-leadership debate, which featured International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde and EU commissioner Viviane Reding, the Congress Hall \u2013 the biggest room in the WEF's maze-like conference centre \u2013 was not as packed as it had been for Henry Kissinger or David Cameron. But the predominantly female audience was enthusiastic and even a mite rebellious. A forest of hands shot up when Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wondered how many had been asked whether they should really be working if they were also mothers.</p> <p>Sandberg, one of the world's richest women, said she had spent years \"never talking about women in business\", but could no longer keep quiet about the \"stereotypes\" that hold women back.</p> <p>Anne Richards, chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management, agreed afterwards that women needed to talk more about the issue. \"We have got to do something for the next generation, and part of that is standing up and being more vocal about it.\" She said men in management positions \u2013 and women themselves \u2013 needed to think about the messages they were giving their colleagues. \"We need people to understand the subliminal signals that they're sending, which may be unintentionally discouraging or judgmental.\"</p> <p>But Finucane believed there had now been enough progress for women to forget their gender and get on with their jobs. \"I think it's evolution. There's an element going on where we have to think about the whole person, man or woman. I think we're releasing ourselves from worrying so much about what other people think \u2013 and that level of liberation allows you to move forward with your job.\"</p> <p>She was also sceptical about the need for legislation to give women a leg-up \u2013 a deeply divisive issue among women at Davos, most of whom have already made it without the benefit of such measures. \"I'm not a fan of quotas; but I am a fan of common sense and intellect, and both of those would cause one to recognise that we should have a lot more women in many more jobs of leadership,\" Finucane said.</p> <p>However, Reding, a firm supporter of new laws to improve balance in the boardroom, told the audience in the conference centre earlier in the day that in Europe \"65% of our university graduates are women, and at some point, we leave them in the corner.\"</p> <p>A draft European law, for which she hopes to win agreement, says that \"at equal talent, at equal competence, if there is a man and a woman to choose from, as long as there are not 40% of women on the board, you choose a woman\". The controversial legislation is intended to be a temporary measure until the gender balance has been improved \u2013 and Reding argues that even the threat of quotas has started to change behaviour.</p> <p>Kelly, the token man on Friday's panel \u2013 who called for strict term limits on board members to be enforced to encourage turnover \u2013 said the best way to sum up the problem of lack of diversity in boardrooms was \"we hire people because they're different, and then we fire them because they're not the same\".</p> <p>But Lagarde, who was once the head of the big US law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie and is a former French finance minister, said, echoing Sandberg, that it was time to \"dare the difference\" and acknowledge that women have different approaches.

The Alpine networking event has frequently been criticised as overwhelmingly male-dominated, reflecting the imbalance at the top levels of global business and politics: despite the fact that attendees are allowed to bring their partners (who wear a special spouse badge), the atmosphere retains a whiff of the old boys' club. The World Economic Forum has tried to boost the number of women on delegations by offering companies an extra place if they bring a woman along; but many events still have all-male panels, and any female selected must pass the WEF's strict criteria about seniority. \"Lots of firms just don't have a woman senior enough to send,\" shrugged one female Davos veteran. And once there, many find themselves shut out of the highest-level, closed door meetings by what another female delegate described as a \"caste system\". Perhaps for that reason, there are several networking events for members of the sisterhood who want to compare notes. At the Schatzalp hotel on Friday evening, high up in the mountains above the twinkling lights of the resort, a high-powered group of women gathered for a champagne reception, swapping business cards and anecdotes. The host, Anne Finucane, Bank of America's global strategy and marketing officer and a member of its board, said it wasn't about huddling together for solidarity but \"problem-solving\". Earlier in the day, for the women-in-leadership debate, which featured International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde and EU commissioner Viviane Reding, the Congress Hall \u2013 the biggest room in the WEF's maze-like conference centre \u2013 was not as packed as it had been for Henry Kissinger or David Cameron. But the predominantly female audience was enthusiastic and even a mite rebellious. A forest of hands shot up when Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wondered how many had been asked whether they should really be working if they were also mothers. Sandberg, one of the world's richest women, said she had spent years \"never talking about women in business\", but could no longer keep quiet about the \"stereotypes\" that hold women back. Anne Richards, chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management, agreed afterwards that women needed to talk more about the issue. \"We have got to do something for the next generation, and part of that is standing up and being more vocal about it.\" She said men in management positions \u2013 and women themselves \u2013 needed to think about the messages they were giving their colleagues. \"We need people to understand the subliminal signals that they're sending, which may be unintentionally discouraging or judgmental.\" But Finucane believed there had now been enough progress for women to forget their gender and get on with their jobs. \"I think it's evolution. There's an element going on where we have to think about the whole person, man or woman. I think we're releasing ourselves from worrying so much about what other people think \u2013 and that level of liberation allows you to move forward with your job.\" She was also sceptical about the need for legislation to give women a leg-up \u2013 a deeply divisive issue among women at Davos, most of whom have already made it without the benefit of such measures. \"I'm not a fan of quotas; but I am a fan of common sense and intellect, and both of those would cause one to recognise that we should have a lot more women in many more jobs of leadership,\" Finucane said. However, Reding, a firm supporter of new laws to improve balance in the boardroom, told the audience in the conference centre earlier in the day that in Europe \"65% of our university graduates are women, and at some point, we leave them in the corner.\" A draft European law, for which she hopes to win agreement, says that \"at equal talent, at equal competence, if there is a man and a woman to choose from, as long as there are not 40% of women on the board, you choose a woman\". The controversial legislation is intended to be a temporary measure until the gender balance has been improved \u2013 and Reding argues that even the threat of quotas has started to change behaviour. Kelly, the token man on Friday's panel \u2013 who called for strict term limits on board members to be enforced to encourage turnover \u2013 said the best way to sum up the problem of lack of diversity in boardrooms was \"we hire people because they're different, and then we fire them because they're not the same\". But Lagarde, who was once the head of the big US law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie and is a former French finance minister, said, echoing Sandberg, that it was time to \"dare the difference\" and acknowledge that women have different approaches. Women made better team players, she said: \"It's because of our history, it's because of our heritage, it's because of what we've had to face.\" Lagarde, who got her job after Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested over a sex scandal and resigned, added: \"Women generally get the job when it's a basket case, when it's a really tough case \u2013 and they usually turn it around.\"",
