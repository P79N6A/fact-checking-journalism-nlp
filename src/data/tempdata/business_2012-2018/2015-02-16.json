And that\u2019s all for tonight.I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to mop up the reaction to today\u2019s event (alarm clock willing :) ) Many thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW The latest developments in Greece also make the front page of the Guardian tonight, along with a dashing picture of a youthful George Osborne. The full story is online here. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co, has an interesting conspiracy theory about that first draft agreement: Greece makes the front page of the FT: Are people being too gloomy tonight? Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reckons he spies the outline of a deal: Worth noting that Dijsselbloem did speak about certain flexibility existing in the current bailout programme, and Varoufakis\u2019s seemingly unsquashable confidence must be based on something..... If you\u2019re just joining us, you should check out our latest news story on tonight\u2019s drama: Greece bailout talks break down after Athens rejects \u2018unacceptable\u2019 eurozone demands Talks between Greece and its eurozone creditors collapsed in disarray on Monday night, heightening concerns that the country is edging closer to a disruptive exit from the eurozone. The breakdown of discussions in Brussels over the Greek bailout programme appeared to leave both sides as far apart as ever, although eurozone finance ministers said a last-ditch summit could be held on Friday. However, the Greek delegation was told in no uncertain terms that talks would recommence only if the country was willing to extend its bailout package, which carries a list of austerity measures that the new left-wing government in Athens has vowed to pare back. Effectively presenting Greece with an ultimatum, the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers said Athens had until Friday to agree to maintain the current bailout under the auspices of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 something that Greece has said is unacceptable. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, made it clear in the acrimonious discussions in Brussels on Monday that Greece would not accept prolonging the bail out for six months unless the other 18 members of the eurozone agreed to water down the austerity conditions attached to the deal. Varoufakis insisted that an \u201chonourable agreement\u201d was within reach for Greece, despite voicing strong criticism of unspecified advocates of Greece\u2019s current bailout, who were playing \u201cgames with the future of Europe\u201d. \u201cWe are going to meet half way during the next couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope will do the usual trick, it will pull a good agreement, an honourable agreement, out of what appears to be an impasse.\u201d... (click here for more) The plot thickens... Greek government insiders are accusing some eurozone officials of deliberately scuppering chances of a breakthrough tonight, reports Efi Efthimiou, reporter at Greece\u2019s CapitalGr. Another quick recap. Greece\u2019s finance minister had predicted that the Eurozone will produce an \u2018honourable agreement\u2019 within 48 hours to unpick the crisis over its bailout. Varoufakis declared: Europe will do the usual trick. It will pull a good agreement, an honourable agreement out of what seems to be an impasse. We did it last Wednesday, we will do it again now. Varoufakis insisted that Greece will not leave the eurozone, despite fears that it could stumble out of its bailout programme in two weeks without a new funding deal. He also blamed eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem for the collapse of talks in Brussels tonight. Varoufakis insisted he was willing to sign up to a statement on Greece\u2019s bailout tonight, before Dijsselbloem changed it. That move by Dijsselbloem triggered the \u2018unprecedented\u2019 collapse of tonight\u2019s talks. Earlier, Dijsselbloem had told reporters that the eurogroup felt strongly that Greece should request an extension of its bailout, to buy time to discuss the way ahead. If you missed the Varoufakis press conference (or want to check any quotes, fellow hacks), there is a video replay here: LIVE: Eurogroup meeting: Greek FinMin Varoufakis speaks after talks failure And Associated Press\u2019s Derek Gatopoulos has kindly uploaded an audio recording. Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times says there\u2019s confusion over why Greece would have signed the original draft statement prepared by Pierre Moscovici, but not the new one presented by Jeroen Dijsselbloem (as Yanis Varoufakis explained earlier) Instant reaction to the Varoufakis press conference (if you missed it, highlights start here) (so=sign) Last question to Yanis Varoufakis: What will markets make of the situation, and is the ball in Greece\u2019s court or the eurogroup\u2019s? To talk about balls in court makes it a game, the Greek finance minister responds. This is not a game. We don\u2019t have the right to play games with the future of Europe. We and our partners are going to meet halfway, in the next couple of days. There will be intense discussions, indeed Varoufakis is sure they\u2019re already happening while he\u2019s in the press room. And he concludes by repeating that a deal will be agreed in time: Europe will do the usual trick. It will pull a good agreement, an honourable agreement out of what seems to be an impasse. We did it last Wednesday, we will do it again now. What will happen if Greece reaches March 1st without a deal? I\u2019ve been taught to avoid hypothetical questions, Varoufakis smiles. Yanis Varoufakis repeats that he was prepared to apply for an extension of Greece\u2019s loan agreement today (before the text was changed). Greece was even prepared to add extra conditions, he declares, to demonstate its commitment to its partners. And then he argues that progress will be made by Wednesday night: I have no doubt that within the next 48 hours Europe will come together and find the phrasing so we can move on to do the real work to find the common ground [and find a new situation] that is good for Greece and Europe. Tonight\u2019s draft statement from the eurogroup is clearly a provocation, so isn\u2019t it proof that Greece must leave the eurozone? Varoufakis denies it, explaining: Europe is going through the difficult process of understanding that Greece has a new government committed to changing a programme that has clearly failed in the eyes of everyone who doesn\u2019t have a vested interest. And he disputes the argument the Greece turned the corner in 2014, because its economy expanded. We only \u201cgrew\u201d because prices in Greece fell faster than activity fell. That\u2019s not growth, it\u2019s a great depression. And he tried to quash Grexit fears: Greece is a member of the eurozone, and will remain a member of the eurozone. Europe is indivisible - anyone who tampers with it is an anti-European. This government is a fully-fledged pro-European, he adds, that simply wants to speak the truth. We have committed to some conditionality, but it\u2019s up to the eurogroup to define what flexibility they are offering, Varoufakis says. If you\u2019re not playing game theory, or poker, can you assure your electors that they won\u2019t soon be playing Monopoly with fake money? I always play Monopoly with real Monopoly money, Varoufakis replies. And game theory assumes that players\u2019 motives are fixed and selfish interests -- that\u2019s not the case here. Onto questions. You\u2019ve been given an ultimatum to ask for a bailout extension by Friday, so what will you do? The history of the EU shows that nothing good comes from ultimatums, says Varoufakis. He is sure that \u201cany notion of an ultimatum\u201d will be withdrawn in the coming days. We want a phrase that allows both sides to explore common ground. Varoufakis states that Pierre Moscovici presented him today with a draft communique that he was \u201cperfectly happy to sign there &amp; then\u201d . But then, he claims, it was withdrawn by eurozone chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem in favour of a different draft that unwound all the progress made by officials in recent ways. All we got was some \u201cnebulous words\u201d, promising \u201csome flexibility\u201d. So, despite our \u201cinfinite goodwill\u201d, we weren\u2019t able to sign the communique, Varoufakis continues. Varoufakis: it would be simply wrong for the new Greek government to simply agree to an unchanged bailout extension, having won an election on the basis of reforming it. Varoufakis says that he is happy to report that today\u2019s talks took place in a collegiate spirit. And he has no doubt that the talks will continue, and no doubts that there will be an agreement - one that is good for Greece and Europe. So why no communique, again? The real reason is a substantial disagreement whether the task is to complete a programme that this government was elected to challenge. Or whether the task is to sit down and rethink this programme from scratch. A programme that has failed to stabilise Greece, created a major humanitarian crisis, and made reforming Greece ever so hard, he says. That programme has created the debt-deflation crisis now gripping the Greek economy. Yanis Varoufakis has arrived for his press conference - livestream here. The early break-up of today\u2019s eurogroup talks was \u201cunprecedented\u201d, says Raoul Ruparel of the Open Europe thinktank. It shows that the eurogroup is playing hardball with Greece. He writes: \u201cThat escalated quickly\u201d, as Ron Burgundy might have put it. After a relatively quiet weekend and some optimistic tones \u2013 albeit mainly from the Greek government rather than the rest of the Eurozone \u2013 tonight\u2019s Eurogroup meeting of Eurozone finance ministers was broken up after less than 30 minutes. Throughout the entire Eurozone crisis we have not seen a finance ministers\u2019 meeting going so badly. In fact, at one point the talks descended into outright farce. And in conclusion...Ruparel says he Greek government now faces a pretty tough choice. It is looking increasingly alone and the best outcome it can probably hope for in the short term is getting some favourable phrasing or wording in the extension. Whether or not this will fly with the hard-line left-wing of the Syriza party or with the general public is another question altogether. Good news; Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s press conference will be streamed live, here. LIVE Eurogroup meeting - Greek national briefing We\u2019ll cover the key points. Journalists in Brussels are now waiting for Greece\u2019s finance minister to give his side of the story: Wow. A quick recap must be in order, after a couple of fast-moving hours. The crisis over Greece\u2019s bailout programme has escalated after crunch talks in Brussels today broke up early, with the two sides as divided as ever. The crucial negotiations collapsed after Greece refused to accept demands from eurozone finance ministers that it should ask for an extension to its bailout. The meeting, which was expected to last until midnight, ended around 7pm local time -- shortly after the draft proposal was leaked to the media, complete with notes from Greek finance chief Yanis Varoufakis. Greek sources said the proposal was unacceptable. This triggered an early press conference in Brussels (highlights start here) Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that there was a strong feeling was that Greece should ask to extend its current bailout, which runs out at the end of February. Only then could the two sides talk about how Athens could take advantage of \u201cflexibility\u201d in the programme. Although Dijsselbloem said that an extension could look similar to the \u2018bridge programme\u2019 proposed by Athens, he was clear that it would have to include most of the existing bailout programme. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said there was little clarity on how Greece could drop 30% of the programme and replace it with new measures, as finance chief Yanis Varoufakis has argued. Moscovici added that: We come back to logic. I want us to be logical, not ideological. Christine Lagarde of the IMF warned that its next bailout payment cannot be handed over unless Greece is meeting the terms of its current programme. This puts the ball firmly back in Greece\u2019s court. If Athens asks for a bailout extension, then ministers could meet again on Friday. But if not, it risks reaching the end of February without a new funding arrangement. Dijsselbloem confirmed that Greece could ask for a whole new bailout programme, but warned that it would be based on the same principles as its previous two. Your move, Athens. Why doesn\u2019t the eurogroup understand that Greece feels trapped by the commitments of the previous government? Eurogroup chief Dijsselbloem replies that there is some flexibility in the current bailout programme, but that Athens must also stick to its main principles and targets. And how different would a new Greek programme be? Not very different, Dijsselbloem replies. It would have to be based on three principles -- fiscal and debt sustainability, reforming its economy to make it more competitive, and ensuring the stability of its financial sector. We all want Greece to become financially self-supporting, he concludes. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference - summary and reaction to follow. Is Friday the new deadline? There could be a new eurogroup meeting on Friday, but only if Greece asks for a bailout extension, Dijsselbloem replies. And he reveals that he\u2019s spoken to European Council president Donald Tusk, who has no intention of calling a summit to tackle this crisis. Was there any discussion about capital controls in Greece? Dijsselbloem indicates that there was not. Why hasn\u2019t the eurogroup adjusted the terms of a bailout extension to recognise the fact there\u2019s been an election in Greece? Moscovici takes this question -- he says that there was support for the idea that Greece would only continue with 70% of the bailout. But the technical work in recent days didn\u2019t show exactly what the 30% would be. So the eurogroup returned to the idea that Greece should seek an extension. We come back to logic. I want us to be logical, not ideological. Could Greece ask for a third bailout when its current programme expires on the 28th February? Dijsselbloem: Any country can ask for programme, but it would be a combination of money and conditions. And in the case of Greece, given the need for stability, it is very much the preferred option to ask for an extension now. Is the International Monetary Fund worried? Christine Lagarde explains that the IMF\u2019s programme expires in March 2016. A review of that programme is overdue. If Greece requests a bailout extension, and commits to implementing its current programme, then we can continue to work together. But if the conclusion is that this is not the case, then disbursement cannot take place....and there could then be discussions about new terms and conditions. That\u2019s the difference between an extension and a bridging arrangement, Lagarde explains -- an extension includes a pledge to continue with what\u2019s been promised (and therefore gets bailout funding as targets are hit) Some drafts have been prepared that upset the Greek government in recent days, so what\u2019s happening? Dijsselbloem says that many proposals have been drafted, some by the eurogroup, some by others, some by Greece. So we\u2019ve gone back to basics -- our preferred option is for Greece to seek an extension of its programme, and then we can discuss the way ahead. Pierre Moscovici repeats that an extension is the only option for Greece: Is there any support for lowering Greece\u2019s budget surplus targets? Dijsselbloem: That\u2019s really a question for the Institutions (the ECB, the IMF and the EC -- the old Troika). But there is some flexibility within the programme which could be offered, while still keeping it broadly on track. Next question: Why can\u2019t we simply call the extension a bridging programme? Dijsselbloem explains that there has to be a commitment from Greece to accept the main features of the programme, that the budget targets can\u2019t derail. So it\u2019s fundamentally an extension of the current programme. Onto Questions. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel goes first. Given Greece doesn\u2019t want an extension, are we looking at a third bailout? Dijsselbloem replies that he would favour a bailout extension. And having listened to the Greek minister\u2019s idea of a bridging solution, it sounds to me like an extension to the program. Different words, but it could be the same solution....but that request must come from the Greek government. EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici says there is no alternative to a bailout extension: Time is short, he continues. If a request for a bailout extension comes in, then we could have another eurogroup meeting on Friday. Dijsselbloem continues to explain that a bailout extension request from Greece should come with several commitments, including: Not to roll back any existing measures An unequivical agreement to meet its commitement to its lenders, and to ensure financial stability And a commitment to work with the programme. It is now up to Greece to decide whether to ask for an extension and to take advantage of the flexibility available in the programme, he says, adding: There was a very strong feeling... that the next step must come from the Greek authorities. Onto Greece. Dijsselbloem explains that the eurogroup didn\u2019t get an agreement last Wednesday. Then he and Greek PM Tsipras agreed to start technical work on the bailout, and to examine how Greece could cover the 30% of their bailout programme which they want to abandon. Today officials from the \u201cinstitutions\u201d reported back.... ministers had a slight sense of disappointment over the work, and that there was \u201cno firm common ground\u201d on what a new programme would look like. Then, in today\u2019s meeting.... the general feeling is that the best thing would be for the Greek authorities to seek an extension to its programme, says Dijsselbloem. We simply need more time to examine Greece\u2019s proposals, so an extension would give us the ability to do that work. On Cyprus, the eurogroup \u201ctook stock\u201d of its bailout programme; the main hurdle is the demand for new laws for foreclosures (to help banks act on bad loans), which Cyprus MPs are refusing to pass. That law needs to be approved so that the programme can continue, Dijsselbloem says. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem begins by covering other business from today\u2019s meeting. The eurogroup has decided to support Portugal\u2019s plan to repay its IMF loans early, to take advantage of current low borrowing costs. Reminder, there\u2019s a live feed here. Here we go.... Dijsselbloem, Lagarde, Regling and Moscovici have arrived. Some instant reaction to the dramatic developments in Brussels in the last hour: Journalists are filing into the press conference room now..... This is the second time in five days that a eurogroup meeting has broken up without any progress on Greece. Last Wednesday, arguments over draft statements dragged on until midnight, followed by a short press conference in which Jeroen Dijsselbloem basically admitted that they\u2019d made no progress. What\u2019s he going to say this time?! GW (tagging with NF) What a mess! The eurogroup has broken up, in acrimony after the leaking of the draft statement which Greece was unable to accept. A press conference has been called. It\u2019s being streamed live here. https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/567383853548208128 Looks like its over and a press conference to follow: Greek officials are saying they are still negotiating in the eurogroup, Reuters is reporting. They say the rejected draft proposal came from eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Reuters appears to have the draft eurogroup statement and there seems little sign of compromise on the EU creditors side, if this is what they expected to reach agreement on tonight: 16-Feb-2015 17:22 - GREECE REJECTED DRAFT TEXT THAT SAID EURO ZONE WOULD MAKE USE OF \u201cFLEXIBILITY IN THE CURRENT PROGRAMME\u201d -GREEK OFFICIALS 16-Feb-2015 17:22 - REJECTED DRAFT, SEEN BY REUTERS, CALLED ON GREECE TO \u201cREFRAIN FROM UNILATERAL ACTION\u201d 16-Feb-2015 17:23 - REJECTED DRAFT SAID GREECE WOULD REQUEST SIX-MONTH TECHNICAL EXTENSION OF CURRENT BAILOUT PROGRAMME 16-Feb-2015 17:24 - REJECTED DRAFT SAID GREECE WOULD COMMIT TO \u201cAPPROPRIATE PRIMARY FISCAL SURPLUSES\u201d, ANY NEW MEASURES \u201cSHOULD BE FUNDED\u201d 16-Feb-2015 17:25 - REJECTED DRAFT SAID GREEKS \u201cINDICATED THEY INTEND TO SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDE THE PROGRAMME\u201d, TAKING GOVT PLANS INTO ACCOUNT 16-Feb-2015 17:29 - REJECTED DRAFT SAID EUROGROUP FAVOURED SIX-MONTH EXTENSION TO AVAILABILITY OF EFSF BONDS IN GREEK BANK BAILOUT FUND Meanwhile, Greek banks could run out of collateral for new loans in 14 weeks, according to JP Morgan. It bases this on the fact they are losing around \u20ac2bn euros of deposits a week, and assumes that outflows continue at this pace. Reuters explains: This is based on its calculation that of a maximum \u20ac108bn of financing available from the European Central Bank and Greek central bank, Greek banks have already used up \u20ac80bn, leaving them with \u20ac28bn if needed. The full story is here: Greek banks to run out of collateral in 14 weeks: JP Morgan Although this is not looking good for an agreement today, according to these Reuters snaps: 16-Feb-2015 16:52 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS EUROGROUP DISCUSSED \u201cUNREASONABLE\u201d, \u201cUNACCEPTABLE\u201d DRAFT TEXT INSISTING ON EXTENDING BAILOUT 16-Feb-2015 16:54 - GREEK GOVT OFFICIAL SAYS THAT \u201cIN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE CANNOT BE A DEAL TODAY\u201d But that may not mean an early cut: My colleague Jennifer Rankin is in Brussels and reports that the main event appears to be getting underway: And as the eurogroup talks continue, shares in Greece have fallen back and bond yields have risen. The Athens stock market has closed down 3.83% at 859.7, after climbing to a two month high on Friday in anticipation of a deal. Meanwhile bonds continued to come under pressure, with three year yields rising from 15.3% on Friday to 17.08%. A reminder of what the eurogroup has on its agenda today: The Eurogroup will continue the discussion on the situation in Greece, considering the upcoming expiry of Greece\u2019s current economic adjustment programme. The ministers will also discuss the economic situation in the euro area and will look into the European Commission\u2019s winter forecast, which was published on 5 February 2015. They will also discuss Portugal\u2019s plans for early repayment of a part of the financial assistance received from the International Monetary Fund. There will also be a discussion on the state of play regarding the ongoing economic adjustment programme in Cyprus. The Eurogroup will also be briefed on the results of the informal EU summit held on 12 February 2015, in particular regarding the discussion on the Economic and Monetary Union. Greece\u2019s negotiating tactics might be irritating to some of the Europeans (Germany in particular) but they seem to be playing well at home: Sounds like the eurogroup meeting might have started without the main attraction being present: You can see videoclips of all the finance ministers arriving in Brussels, here. So I\u2019m clearing off for a bit; Nick Fletcher has the controls. Spanish finance minister Luis De Guindos has declared that he, like Yanis Varoufakis, has a red line that can\u2019t be broken; Greece must repay its debts. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom in Brussels -- Lithuania\u2019s finance chief has arrived in positive spirits. Lithuania only joined the euro on the first of January, though, so \u0160ad\u017eius may still be in his honeymoon period.... Amid the flurry of newsflashes from Brussels, Finland has also taken a hard line on Greece: Peter Kazimir, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, has also hinted that another eurogroup meeting will be needed to resolve this crisis. Luxembourg\u2019s finance minister, Pierre Gramegnam, told journalists outside the eurogroup that Greece needs to make its position clear: Michael Noonan also wants Greece to put \u2018concrete proposals\u2019 on the table for finance ministers to discuss. Oh gawd.... Next up - Irish finance minister Michael Noonan. He tells reporters that nothing which happened over the weekend could be called a breakthrough for Greece (fair enough) French finance minister Michel Sapin has arrived, telling reporters that a \u2018good solution\u2019 would be that Greece\u2019s current programme is extended, to give time for talks. Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans Joerg Schelling, just told reporters in Brussels that Greece cannot renegotiate the terms of its current bailout. The eurogroup will try to make progress, he added, but time is short... Speaking of pessimism.....Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has just arrived at the eurogroup meeting, telling reporters that the ball is in Greece\u2019s court: Here are the Reuters newsflashes: BRUSSELS: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS: WHAT I HEARD SO FAR DIDN\u2019T STRENGTHEN MY OPTIMISM ABOUT GREECE BRUSSELS: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS: AS LONG AS THE GREEK GOVERNMENT DOESN\u2019T WANT A PROGRAMME I DON\u2019T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OPTIONS There\u2019s little hope of a breakthrough today over Greece\u2019s bailout, as eurozone finance ministers prepare to hold fresh talks. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has insisted that he is not bluffing when he seeks a new deal with Greece\u2019s creditors. Writing in the New York Times today, Varoufakis says: As finance minister of a small, fiscally stressed nation lacking its own central bank and seen by many of our partners as a problem debtor, I am convinced that we have one option only: to shun any temptation to treat this pivotal moment as an experiment in strategizing and, instead, to present honestly the facts concerning Greece\u2019s social economy, table our proposals for regrowing Greece, explain why these are in Europe\u2019s interest, and reveal the red lines beyond which logic and duty prevent us from going. Varoufakis has met with eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem, ahead of today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting (which starts soon). Apparently it was brisk.... Several finance ministers have taken a hard line ahead of the meeting. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he was very sceptical that there will be a deal today. Sch\u00e4uble also declared that: \u201cI feel sorry for the Greeks at the moment. They\u2019ve elected a government which is currently acting irresponsibly.\u201d That jibe earned a swift rebuttal from Athens, with Greece\u2019s government spokesman saying Germany was the irresponsible one. Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans Joerg Schelling, has also criticised the Greek government for seeking a six-month window to agree a new deal: \u201cI think it is a misjudgment by Greece. If you look at the repayment needs to which Greece committed itself again at the last meeting, then they need money too, not just time,\u201d France\u2019s Michael Sapin said Greece must stick to EU rules, and warned that Grexit would pose a huge risk to its economy. Sapin also tried to offer Greece some encouragement, saying: \u201cThe Germans are right from a certain point of view. Greece, not the government of today, the country, signed a number of agreements. They must respect those agreements independently of the change of government. But the Greeks say, and they are right, I support them, \u2018we have just changed government, so we are not going to do everything as before. Fears that a deal won\u2019t be reached have hit Greek bonds, and also driven bank shares down in Athens. The main ATG index is currently down almost 4%. Analysts are in broad agreement that a deal won\u2019t be reached today. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX explains: \u201cBy all accounts, it seems that Greece and the broader Euro-Zone are on a collision course: the Syriza-led government doesn\u2019t seem ready to break its electoral promises to end austerity; and the German-led creditor bloc doesn\u2019t seem ready to allow for debt forgiveness away from the current program.\u201d Several are speculating that further emergency meetings will be needed to resolve this deadlock before the end of Greece\u2019s current bailout, on 28 February. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence says Germany is determined to hold a hard line, thus: Athens is preparing itself for the need to hold another Eurogroup meeting soon, potentially even an extraordinary summit of the European Council to resolve the issue at the level of heads of state and governments. But many experts still reckons the two sides will reach a deal eventually. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group explains: Although some ways of, we do believe the contours of an agreement are beginning to emerge. Greece will win its preferred choice of framework. This is likely to be a full, new, ESM bailout, not an extension of the program that currently exists. Germany, however, will win on the substance. The reforms included in the new program are likely to be much more consistent with Germany\u2019s preferences, over issues such as the fiscal primary surplus, privatizations and labor market reform, as time elapses, and the Greek government\u2019s negotiating leverage slowly begins to erode. Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon also sees an opportunity. There is \u201cnegligible chance\u201d of a deal today, reckons Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He believes an \u201cextraordinary summit\u201d of EC leaders may be needed to tackle the crisis. Wolf writes: The Greek government has already been briefing local media that no agreement will be reached today. Similarly, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble declared on Monday morning that based on technical talks held over the weekend, he was sceptical of the chances for a deal. Athens is preparing itself for the need to hold another Eurorgoup meeting soon, potentially even an extraordinary summit of the European Council to resolve the issue at the level of heads of state and governments. The latter might indicate that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras still believes that a mere political deal was achievable \u2013 if so, this will soon turn out to be unrealistic. Led by Germany, Greece\u2019s international creditors appear determined to hold their line and force Athens into providing a specific reform program that preserves the gist of measures enacted under the current program. With two weeks to go until the current program expires, policy-makers in Berlin feel that there is no need to give in too quickly to a government that has still been unwilling or unable to substantiate its own plans. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reports that there are technical glitches at the EC\u2019s offices in Brussels: That\u2019s not terribly collegiate. For an insight into Greece\u2019s negotiating strategy, do check out today\u2019s New York Times. Yanis Varoufakis has written a column for the NYT, in which he\u2019s adamant that he\u2019s not playing with game theory (in which he\u2019s an expert). Instead, the Greek finance minister insists that he\u2019s simply presenting Greece\u2019s position honestly. Here\u2019s a flavour of \u201cNo Time for Games in Europe\u201d. I am often asked: What if the only way you can secure funding is to cross your red lines and accept measures that you consider to be part of the problem, rather than of its solution? Faithful to the principle that I have no right to bluff, my answer is: The lines that we have presented as red will not be crossed. Otherwise, they would not be truly red, but merely a bluff. But what if this brings your people much pain? I am asked. Surely you must be bluffing. The problem with this line of argument is that it presumes, along with game theory, that we live in a tyranny of consequences. That there are no circumstances when we must do what is right not as a strategy but simply because it is ... right. Varoufakis also denies being driven by left-wing ideology. Instead, he says the inspiration is German philosopher Immanuel Kant. I fear that won\u2019t be enough to get Berlin onside Apparently Varoufakis and Dijsselbloem have now concluded their pre-eurogroup meeting: Pierre Moscovici, the EU\u2019s financial commissioner, has just been doorstepped in Brussels. He told reporters that the eurogroup will seek a \u201cpositive conclusion\u201d on Greece: The ANA newswire says Yanis Varoufakis and Jeroen Dijsselbloem were expected to meet for talks ahead of the eurogroup meeting this afternoon. PS: Here\u2019s a couple of screengrabs from this morning\u2019s videoclip, in case you can\u2019t play it on your device: The European Council newsroom has uploaded a videoclip showing eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis arriving at today\u2019s meeting. Although the eurogroup meeting doesn\u2019t formally start until 3pm local time, officials on the Working Group have already been working for a couple of hours. The Bundesbank has urged Greece\u2019s commercial banks not to buy more Greek government debt. In its latest monthly report, just released, Germany\u2019s central bank said that Greek banks reliant on the ECB\u2019s emergency liquidity should \u201ctake steps to improve their liquidity position,\u201d adding: \u201cExtending the liquidity requirements by taking short-term Greek state bonds in the coming weeks would run contrary to this.\u201d Last week, the ECB offered another \u20ac5bn of emergency liquidity to Greek banks, who have been hit by deposit outflows in recent weeks. The Bundesbank also predicts that Germany\u2019s economy could grow father than expected this year. Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor at Greek newspaper Kathimerini, isn\u2019t impressed by the war of words over who is more irresponsible: While Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit sees little room for concessions. Finance ministers should be arriving at the eurogroup meeting in three hours time; hopefully they\u2019ll speak to the press assembled outside. (that\u2019s 3pm Brussels time, or 2pm GMT/4pm EET) Despite the discouraging noises this morning, Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, reckons the eurozone will muddle through this immediate crisis: Kicking cans down roads is the EU\u2019s forte and the most likely outcome of negotiations with Greece is still that a temporary deal is reached so that talks can continue and funding be maintained for now. Back in Athens, government spokesman Gavriil Sakellaridis has also insisted that they\u2019re serious about reaching a deal with eurozone partners: Why was the EU\u2019s trade surplus so much smaller than the eurozone\u2019s last year? Take a bow, British consumers: It\u2019s all kicking off, even before finance ministers arrive in Brussels. Greece\u2019s government has hit back at Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s claim that Athens is behaving irresponsibly, arguing that Berlin is just as culpable for the current deadlock. The scene is set for another tough eurogroup session. Just in. The eurozone\u2019s trade surplus has widened again. The single currency region exported \u20ac24.3bn more goods than it imported in December, up from a \u20ac13.6bn surplus in December 2013. While exports rose by 2% during the year, imports were flat; reflecting a trend since the start of the debt crisis: London newspaper CityAM has published a handy breakdown of the new deal which Greece is seeking; and the likelihood of each part being agreed: The uncertainty over Greece hasn\u2019t hurt the euro today, which is up around 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.1408. But the single currency could weaken if there\u2019s no progress in Brussels. Susanne Galler, a strategist with Jefferies in London, told Reuters: \u201cThe market consensus is for them to do a deal by the end of this week. But we think that if there\u2019s no deal today and the clock starts ticking then the euro will look increasingly vulnerable.\u201d German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also accused the new Greek government of behaving \u2018irresponsibly\u2019 during this morning\u2019s radio interview, reports Agence France-Presse. AFP reports: Sch\u00e4uble, who was recently caricatured in the Greek press as wearing a Nazi-era army uniform, hit out at the insults Greece has dealt to its eurozone partners. \u201cI feel sorry for the Greeks at the moment. They\u2019ve elected a government which is currently acting irresponsibly,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services is also downbeat about how much progress we\u2019ll see today: \u201cIt appears unlikely that there will be even a short-term \u2018bridge\u2019 agreement between Greece and the Euro group at today\u2019s meeting, but it is to be hoped that some further common ground can be found.\u201d Meanwhile, Eurogroup officials are sitting down in Brussels now, to work on the technicalities of today\u2019s meeting. Another worrying sign: Investors are selling out of Greek bonds this morning. The yields (or interest rate) on Greek debt has risen, indicating that it\u2019s seen as riskier. GREEK THREE-YEAR BOND YIELDS RISE 140 BPS TO 17.15% AHEAD OF EUROGROUP MEETING - TRADEWEB GREEK 10-YEAR YIELDS UP 23 BPS AT 9.74%, FIVE-YEAR YIELDS UP 72 BPS AT 13.98% Fears that this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup meeting won\u2019t break the deadlock between Greece and its creditors have hit shares in Athens. The main ATG stock market fell over 4% in early trading, with the banking sector falling over 8%. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel also fears today\u2019s meeting won\u2019t deliver a break-through deal. And that\u2019s really a question for Mario Draghi, I guess. What would it take for the European Central Bank to withdraw emergency liquidity from Greece\u2019s banking sector? \u201cIt\u2019s a day ending in \u2018y\u2019 so it must be another crucial day for the Greek debt crisis,\u201d says a weary-sounding Jeremy Cook of World First. He explains why it\u2019s important that some progress is made today: Alexis Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis have until the end of the month to negotiate an extension of credit terms for Greece. The current bailout package expires on February 28th. A deal today would give other European parliaments just less than a fortnight to vote on the extension and form some kind of consensus and agreement around the rehabilitation of the Greek state. Late on Thursday the European Central Bank extended the amount of money it was willing to provide to Greek banks in a bid to shore up liquidity within the country. Reports over the weekend suggest that the pace of withdrawal from Greek banks has increased in the past week to around EUR200m a day. As we have said previously we are still optimistic that a \u2018fudge\u2019 deal will occur by the end of the month but, as we all know, European politicians need to be horizontal over the precipice for deals to be actually made. I\u2019m cancelling any plans I had for Feb 27th just in case a 13th hour meeting is called to avert a disaster. You and me both, Jeremy... Europe\u2019s stock markets are dipping in early trading, as traders react to the generally negative comments from finance ministers this morning. The FTSE 100 is down 15 points, or -0.23%, at 6857, while Germany\u2019s DAX has dropped by 29 points, or 0.3%. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, writes: Investors are waiting for proof of real progress on both the Greek debt negotiations (extended talks expected, still significant gaps between both sides) and the ceasefire in Ukraine (tentative at best). Thousands of Greek citizens took to the streets last night to show their support for Greece\u2019s negotiators in Brussels today: There were also demonstrations in support of Greece in other European capitals, including Paris and London: The finance ministers of Austria and Malta have also been speaking this morning, and neither sound keen to grant Greece much help: France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has also hit the airwaves this morning to argue that Greece must respect European rules. Speaking on France 2 television a few minutes ago, Sapin warned that Greece would face \u201chuge dangers\u201d if it left the eurozone. Athens cannot simply abandon its commitments, he added; before acknowledging that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new government does have a mandate to push for changes: \u201cThe Germans are right from a certain point of view. Greece, not the government of today, the country, signed a number of agreements. They must respect those agreements independently of the change of government. But the Greeks say, and they are right, I support them, \u2018we have just changed government, so we are not going to do everything as before.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) More optimistically, Sapin also suggested there\u2019s a chance of a breakthrough at today\u2019s talks. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is not optimistic that Greece and its creditors will reach a deal today. Sch\u00e4uble told German radio that: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard about the technical talks over the weekend, I\u2019m very sceptical, but we will get a report today and then we\u2019ll see.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble added that Germany does not want a Greek exit from the euro zone, but reiterated that the new government in Athens must meet the core of its existing commitments. Not an encouraging sign for today\u2019s talks, as ABN Amro\u2019s Nick Kounis says: Good morning. It\u2019s another crunch day in the battle between Greece and its creditors over its bailout programme. Eurozone finance ministers are heading back to Brussels today for another eurogroup meeting. Top of the agenda, Greece\u2019s bailout programme. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras struck a confident tone yesterday, saying: \u201cI expect difficult negotiations on Monday. But I am full of confidence. \u201cI am in favour of a solution where everyone wins. I want a win-win solution. I want to save Greece from tragedy and Europe from a split.\u201d \u201cI promise you: Greece will, in six months\u2019 time, be a completely different country.\u201d Full story: Syriza leader confident ahead of eurozone crunch talks in Brussels Technical officials from both sides have been working over the weekend, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the two sides. That will give ministers something to work with today. But it will be hard to make progress. Athens insists it will not stick to its existing bailout, while eurozone governments insist its debts cannot be written it off. It\u2019s possible that some kind of compromise will be hammered out; solving Greece\u2019s immediate funding needs once its existing financing ends in just two weeks. But a repeat of the deadlock at last Wednesday night\u2019s emergency eurogroup meeting can\u2019t be ruled out. And that\u2019s why one former UK finance minister, Kenneth Clarke, reckons the \u201clatterday Trotskyites\u201d of Syriza will trigger Grexit. Full Story: Kenneth Clarke says Syriza victory risks Greek exit from eurozone The meeting is scheduled to start at 3pm Brussels time (2pm GMT or 4pm EET). So if all sides embrace the concept of European friendship and partnership, it could be wrapped up by tea time. A late-night marathon feels more likely, though.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the build-up to the meeting, and the action once it kicks off, along with other key developments in the world economy, the financial markets and business.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The unemployment figures released last week by the Bureau of Statistics showed that youth unemployment at 20% is now as high as it has been since June 1997. However, as bad as that figure is, the causes of the high rate are quite surprising. They suggest that young people are responding to the weak employment situation not by giving up, but by continuing to look for work and continuing with their education while doing so. Without any compulsion by government, youth are either earning or learning in greater numbers than ever before. The youth unemployment rate invariably rises or falls faster than the overall number of unemployed. Since 1978, the unemployment rate for 15 to 19-year-olds rises or falls on average each year by around one percentage point more than the total: And yet over the past 12 months, while the total unemployment rate has risen 0.4 percentage points from 5.9% to 6.3%, the youth unemployment rate has skyrocketed 3.5 percentage points from 16.5% to 20%. The difference in speed of the increase between the two rates is now second only to the eight-month period at the start of the 1990 recession, when young workers were laid off by the truckload and youth unemployment soared to a record high of 25% by the middle of 1992. So an abnormally fast rising youth unemployment rate is certainly cause for concern. This concern is heightened when we consider that while the annual employment for 20 to 24-year-olds has improved in the past 12 months, for 15 to 19-year-olds it has stayed dismally negative: The falling employment is most clearly observed among full-time youth workers. Male full-time employment fell 4.7% in the past 12 months, while female full-time work collapsed by 13.6%. Part-time work remains flat. At least it is not falling, but there is nothing to get very excited about: And yet, when we look at the youth labour force figures there is actually some small degree of optimism because the percentage of youth in the labour force \u2013 either working or trying to get work \u2013 has actually increased in the past year. When we say that youth unemployment is 20%, of course that doesn\u2019t mean 20% of all youth are unemployed \u2013 just that 20% of 15 to 19 years in the labour force are unemployed. Only 54% of 15 to 19-year-olds are in the workforce, the rest either are studying and not bothering to look for work, or are neither studying nor looking for work. This latter group is one that does not fit into the picture of the current line of thinking \u2013 where the government (and the ALP for that matter) would have you believe a youth must either be \u201cearning or learning\u201d. The 2014 budget also suggested that job seekers under 30 applying for Newstart or Youth Allowance, who have not been previously employed, would face a six-month waiting period of no income support, depending on their work history. This measure has been unable to pass the Senate and the new social services minister, Scott Morrison, seems to have sensibly dumped that policy. Using such sticks to try and force youth to either get a job or stay in education are really just measures designed to look tough on bludgers rather than an effective employment policy. The data shows there are more youth than ever before either in the labour force or in education, and history also shows that the key to getting more youth employed is the same as all other age groups \u2013 stronger economic growth. In December, just a record low 3.99% of 15 to 19-year-olds were not in either the labour force or in education; and a record high 92.6% who were either working or learning or doing both: And it is here that we start to see why the youth unemployment rate has soared in the past year and why it is not such a bad thing. Many youth both work and attend education places of some kind \u2013 whether high school, or TAFE, university or another tertiary institution. Back in 1992 when youth unemployment hit 25%, just 17.7% of youth were both working and attending education; now that figure is up to 27.6%. By contrast, back then 24.5% of youth were only working, compared with 16.2% of youth now: Interestingly, after a decade where the levels of 15 to 19-year-olds only working, or both working and learning remained quite stable, after the GFC the proportion who were only working collapsed. And if we look closer at each category of youth either in or out of the labour market an unusual change occurred over the past year. As the number of youth in employment fell over the past 12 months, not surprisingly the proportion of youth working fell, but surprisingly the proportion of youth who were unemployed, but not in education also fell. Throughout 2011 to midway through 2013, around 45% of youth unemployed were not in education, and yet over the past 12 months the number of youth unemployed who also aren\u2019t in education has actually fallen by around 16%. In that same time the number of unemployed youth who are in education has risen 11%. This has led to the participation rate of youth actually rising in the past 12 months from 52.7% to 54% \u2013 in stark contrast with the total participation rate which has stayed flat. Thus youth, rather than viewing the weak job market and giving up on job hunting, are continuing to try, but are more than ever before staying in (or returning to) education while doing so. This allows them to continue building up their skills which will help them get work when the economy picks up: Usually when the economy is weak we see an increase in the number of people giving up on looking for work \u2013 but that is not happening at the moment with the youth. Despite the weak employment growth the participation rate of youth is increasing. Furthermore, while they\u2019re trying to get work, more and more of them are either staying in or returning to education. The youth are already earning and learning \u2013 and doing so without the government needing to force them to.",

      "bodyText": "As the financial authorities poke around HSBC \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority joined the queue on Monday \u2013 one question should be near the top of the agenda: is it time to abolish the unwritten rule that says only an insider is allowed to chair the bank? The last time this question was debated was 2010, when then-chairman Stephen Green left to join the government. A fine old squabble erupted when it became clear that Michael Geoghegan, then the chief executive, would not be offered the job. Green himself had made the jump from chief executive to chairman, as had Sir John Bond before him. Sir Keith Whitson, another former HSBC chief executive, was appalled that external candidates were being considered and wrote to the Daily Telegraph to say so. \u201cHSBC\u2019s success is not the result of bringing in outsiders to chair the board,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is because it has created a unique culture of commitment, loyalty and experience among its top executives and promoted from within.\u201d In the end, the insiders-only principle was obeyed. The finance director, Douglas Flint, got the nod as chairman and Stuart Gulliver, the head of investment banking, replaced Geoghegan. The Flint/Gulliver double-act continues to this day. But, while Whitson\u2019s praise for HSBC\u2019s \u201ctruly amazing culture\u201d sounded credible in 2010, the words jar horribly today. Since then the bank has been fined $1.9bn (\u00a31.2bn) by the US authorities after leaving its Mexican unit wide open to money-laundering by drug cartels; as a result, HSBC operates under a deferred prosecution agreement with the US department of justice. Now the shabby practices in the Swiss private bank in 2005-07 have been exposed. Would history have been different if HSBC had had an independent non-executive chairman? Impossible to say, of course. The board, it might be argued, had plenty of big-hitters among its conventional non-executives to hold the executives to account. But having an independent chairman is not a pointless piece of nit-picking on the part of corporate governance wonks. The system is designed, in part, to protect against group-think and to serve as a visible check on the power of insiders. HSBC, after its massive expansion drive in 1999-2003, might have benefited from having an experienced outsider in the chairman\u2019s seat asking awkward questions such as: are you sure you know what\u2019s going in every corner of your empire? As it is, Flint, when HSBC reports full-year results next Monday, will have to deal with questions about his own credibility. He has been on HSBC\u2019s board since 1995, and so was there during Mexico, Switzerland and the disastrous purchase of the US sub-prime lender Household. It is a point to remember when HSBC says it put \u201ca more rigorous control structure\u201d in place in the Swiss private bank \u201cbeginning in 2008\u201d. Flint was a member of the board that bought the Republic and Safra banks in 1999 and let them run for eight years with less rigorous controls. As it happens, Flint\u2019s position should be safe, assuming he puts on a convincing show in front of MPs two days later: even US authorities, in the midst of the money-laundering scandal, praised HSBC\u2019s level of co-operation (not that the bank had any choice, of course). But next time around, an outside chairman is essential. The governance code is framed as an invitation to comply or explain. HSBC\u2019s traditional explanation \u2013 that it is better than all other banks \u2013 no longer works. No big deal for William Hill James Henderson, William Hill\u2019s chief executive, never got round to telling shareholders why he thought bidding for 888 Holdings was a good idea. Now he doesn\u2019t have to. The deal is off and the possibility of revival looks remote if one of 888\u2019s founding Israeli shareholders is holding out for 300p a share. William Hill had offered 200p, or \u00a3700m. The semi-official reasons for William Hill\u2019s interest were that 888 has some whizzy technology and an acquisition would quicken the march overseas. Well, OK, it might be worth paying a modest takeover premium for that. But 15 times earnings \u2013 as implied by 200p a share \u2013 was surely about as far as it could go. First, it has taken a vow to steer clear of unregulated markets on the grounds that your business can evaporate on a politician\u2019s whim; in 888\u2019s case, about a third of its revenues are unregulated. Second, William Hill likes to put everything under its own brand, so presumably valued 888\u2019s at roughly zero. Henderson, then, gets top marks for showing financial discipline in negotiations. But he has also advertised the fact that he feels his firm\u2019s technology could do with an upgrade, despite the group having the much-admired Playtech, another Israeli outfit, as a supplier.

The NHS remains the most popular response to the question of the \u201csingle issue that will concern you most when it comes to casting your vote\u201d, but \u201cjobs, prices and wages\u201d has now overtaken immigration as the second priority for voters this month \u2013 and that may be helping the Conservatives win back some support, from Ukip in particular. Ed Miliband will be dismayed not to see any immediate pay-off in Monday\u2019s poll for his gamble to confront the wealthy businessmen who have been lining up to attack him, such as Boots boss Stefano Pessina, whom he denounced for avoiding British taxes in Monaco. But the poll contains warnings to business people who imagine that they can sway voters, and may even encourage Miliband to press on. A mere 21% of respondents, who are disproportionately Conservatives, respectfully listen to businesses that weigh into politics on the basis that they know \u201cwhat is best for the economy\u201d. That compares with a crushing majority of 70% who agree that \u201cbusinessmen are just in it for themselves, and what they say will not influence my vote\u201d. ICM Unlimited interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 13-15th February 2015. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.",

Fenland district council said Tesco had agreed to set up a community fund that will give grants to local charities, community groups and clubs in Chatteris, where the retailer built a 47,000 sq ft store, which it no longer wants, and Whittlesey, where it has scrapped plans for the development of a 36,000 sq ft store. A Tesco spokesman said the money provided to Fenland council was not compensation and had been provided as part of its normal community funding scheme. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at new ways we can help local charities and community groups, whether it\u2019s food banks or local hospices, and we\u2019re proud to support a range of great local causes in every part of the country. \u201d The payment is one of the first of several expected to emerge as towns around the country negotiate with Tesco over the future of 49 abandoned development sites and 43 stores which are to close. In Bridgwater, Somerset, two local councils are in talks with Tesco over an \u00a311m deal to buy a piece of land where plans for a new store have been abandoned, while in Banff, Aberdeenshire, negotiations continue over a \u00a310m land deal. Meanwhile, people in Kirkby, near Liverpool, are not impressed by an iron sculpture of a dead tree which forms the centrepiece of the supermarket\u2019s promise to complete improvement works in their town centre after walking away from plans for a new store. The tree, which is part of a \u00a3320,000 spruce up of the town centre paid for by Tesco and the local Knowsley council, is thought to have cost up to \u00a360,000. Locals commenting on the Knowsley Market Facebook page dismissed it as an \u201ceyesore\u201d and a \u201ctotal waste of money\u201d. Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones named the piece by Geoff Wood among the UK\u2019s six worst pieces of public art, saying it \u201csays nothing meaningful to or about Kirkby and its citizens\u201d. Dave Kelly, chairman of pressure group 1st 4 Kirkby, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that the council and Tesco were spending money on artworks when there were more pressing matters at hand. He called on Tesco to help fund a feasibility study into saving 72 empty homes linked to its development site which are currently scheduled for demolition despite plans for the new supermarket being axed. \u201cThe tree is the wrong thing in the wrong place at the wrong time. If Tesco is looking to leave a legacy because it has abandoned the town, it would be far more appropriate to look into saving those homes,\u201d Kelly said. Tesco announced the dramatic plans to axe stores and developments as part of a bid by its new chief executive, Dave Lewis, to revive the fortunes of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket which is suffering from falls in sales and profits. As many as 9,000 jobs are expected to go as part of a plan to slash \u00a3250m of running costs while Tesco is also ditching its defined benefit pension scheme. All the major supermarkets are trying to trim their operating costs as they try and support profits while cutting prices for shoppers. The rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as an economic climate which has put pressure on most people\u2019s spending power is driving a price war which is also being fuelled by deflation in food commodity prices.",

      "body": "<p>Shares in 888 Holdings tumbled after the online gambling company said talks about a \u00a3720m takeover by high-street bookmakers William Hill had ended.</p> <p>Discussions between the two broke down because a large shareholder in 888 thought the price was too low, said 888, whose shares fell 11% to 151.75p after the news.</p> <p>The Gibraltar-based online poker and gaming company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/10/888-shares-william-hill-considering-takeover-bid-750m\">announced last week that William Hill had approached</a> it about a possible offer of 200p a share plus a 3p dividend. Its board held talks with Britain\u2019s largest high street bookmakers and 888\u2019s main shareholders with the aim of agreeing a recommended offer.<br></p> <p>In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, 888 said: \u201cDue to a significant difference of opinion on value with a key stakeholder, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the terms of a possible offer and the board of the company has agreed with William Hill to terminate discussions.\u201d</p> <p>The gambling website was founded by the Israel-based Ben-Yitzhak and Shaked families, which together control about 60% of the company. The holding of the latter family is made up of two trusts that each own 24.34%, one representing Avi Shaked and the other the children of his late brother. The Ben-Yitzhaks have about 10.5%.</p> <p>Industry insiders say that the Shakeds keep in in close contact with 888 management about the business. It is thought that Avi Shaked \u2013 who is known to have met with the company\u2019s corporate advisers \u2013 proved to be the block on the William Hill approach as he pressed for a higher offer, believed to be about 300p a share.</p> <p>Analysts have expected takeovers in the betting sector after changes late last year to the way the UK taxes online gambling. The introduction of the point of consumption tax lets HM Revenue &amp; Customs tax profits made by online betting companies from UK gamblers, even though the bets are mainly placed with websites based offshore in low-tax jurisdictions.<br></p> <p>The collapse of the talks has scuppered what would have been the first big deal for William Hill since <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/business/2014/jul/04/william-hill-ralph-topping-retires-james-henderson-new-betting-ceo\">James Henderson succeeded Ralph Topping as chief executive last year</a>. Topping had led a string of takeovers, including Sportingbet\u2019s Australian business and the acquisition of the 29% of a joint venture with Playtech it did not already own. </p> <p>888 has been the subject of takeover approaches several times before.

      "bodyText": "Shares in 888 Holdings tumbled after the online gambling company said talks about a \u00a3720m takeover by high-street bookmakers William Hill had ended. Discussions between the two broke down because a large shareholder in 888 thought the price was too low, said 888, whose shares fell 11% to 151.75p after the news. The Gibraltar-based online poker and gaming company announced last week that William Hill had approached it about a possible offer of 200p a share plus a 3p dividend. Its board held talks with Britain\u2019s largest high street bookmakers and 888\u2019s main shareholders with the aim of agreeing a recommended offer. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, 888 said: \u201cDue to a significant difference of opinion on value with a key stakeholder, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the terms of a possible offer and the board of the company has agreed with William Hill to terminate discussions.\u201d The gambling website was founded by the Israel-based Ben-Yitzhak and Shaked families, which together control about 60% of the company. The holding of the latter family is made up of two trusts that each own 24.34%, one representing Avi Shaked and the other the children of his late brother. The Ben-Yitzhaks have about 10.5%. Industry insiders say that the Shakeds keep in in close contact with 888 management about the business. It is thought that Avi Shaked \u2013 who is known to have met with the company\u2019s corporate advisers \u2013 proved to be the block on the William Hill approach as he pressed for a higher offer, believed to be about 300p a share. Analysts have expected takeovers in the betting sector after changes late last year to the way the UK taxes online gambling. The introduction of the point of consumption tax lets HM Revenue &amp; Customs tax profits made by online betting companies from UK gamblers, even though the bets are mainly placed with websites based offshore in low-tax jurisdictions. The collapse of the talks has scuppered what would have been the first big deal for William Hill since James Henderson succeeded Ralph Topping as chief executive last year. Topping had led a string of takeovers, including Sportingbet\u2019s Australian business and the acquisition of the 29% of a joint venture with Playtech it did not already own. 888 has been the subject of takeover approaches several times before. It held talks with Ladbrokes in 2011 about a possible bid that would have valued the Israeli business at around \u00a3150m. That followed another aborted approach by Ladbrokes in 2006. But despite the setbacks, company insiders were keen to keep 888 in acquisition play on Monday, saying that the company was not \u201cbid-proof\u201d and that it expected others could make moves to buy the website. They also played down the suggestion of any fallout between the Shaked family and the 888 board. Details of the talks with William Hill emerged last week, even though the deal was thought to have gone into hibernation by that point. A draft stock exchange statement confirming the discussions had been prepared as long ago as December, but was not required until the media revealed the existence of the talks. Brian Mattingley, 888\u2019s chief executive who is scheduled to become executive chair later this year, said: \u201cThe company is in good health and continues to trade comfortably in line with expectations. The company will announce its full-year results on 24 March 2015 and the board of the company looks forward to the future with confidence.\u201d William Hill shares edged up 0.8% to 385.6p.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is scrutinising working practices inside HSBC in the wake of revelations that the Swiss subsidiary of Britain\u2019s biggest bank helped its clients avoid tax. Stopping short of launching an investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority said the leak of the bank account details \u201chas served to reinforce the importance of firms operating with the right culture across all of their operations\u201d. The FCA \u2013 which has admitted it learnt about about the tax scandal through the media \u2013 is also cooperating with the Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and HMRC. \u201cThe FCA is working closely with the firm and other agencies which have an interest in this matter to ensure that any questions this may raise in relation to any current practices and culture of HSBC are addressed,\u201d the FCA said.

      "bodyText": "Japan pulled itself out of recession in the last three months of 2014, but the rebound was weaker than expected as household and corporate spending failed to move up a gear. The preliminary reading for gross domestic product (GDP) showed a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.6% in October to December, which Tokyo said translates into an annualised 2.2%. The annualised figure was much smaller than a 3.7% increase forecast in a Reuters poll and underlines the challenge premier the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, faces in shaking off decades of stagnation. Analysts said the fragile recovery was the hangover from last spring\u2019s sales hike that shocked Japanese consumers and triggered a six-month spending freeze. The economic minister, Akira Amari, said the economy was on track for a recovery with signs that consumer sentiment was finally picking up. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts Takuji Aida and Kiyoko Katahira said Abe\u2019s decision to push back a second sales tax hike by two years to 2017, would give the economy a strong boost. \u201cGiven that PM Abe has decided to postpone the second tax hike to April 2017 from October 2015, the downside pressure in 2015 has largely been removed,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe GDP growth rate for 2015 should be supported by robust consumption and trade, and we forecast growth of around 1.5% year on year. \u201cAbe has announced he will not delay the second tax hike again. In other words, he has made a strong commitment to reflate the economy,.\u201d But some analysts warned that weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure remained a worrying sign. \u201cThese are somewhat disappointing figures,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThe situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.\u201d However, the rebound from recession will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The central bank has proved to be one of the most aggressive in printing money to make borrowing cheaper and to drive down the value of the yen. Like most central banks, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has seen inflation fall below its 2% target following the collapse in oil prices that has dramatically cut fuel costs and a slowdown in China that has reduced the price of other commodities. Abe said he hoped the central bank continued with its bold monetary easing campaign to boost lending and inflation back to its target. Speaking in parliament, Abe praised the BoJ\u2019s aggressive stimulus programme for helping revive the economy and wipe out the public\u2019s \u201csticky deflationary mindset\u201d. He acknowledged that some weakness in household spending, but added that he saw signs of recovery in the economy, such as improvements in consumer sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ll strive to ensure that wages keep rising this year and next, so that the warm breeze of recovery blows throughout the nation,\u201d Abe said.",

    "webTitle": "Etsy IPO stokes fierce debate as some say artisan craft site is selling its soul", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Etsy, the online marketplace popular with hipsters across the globe, is preparing for the biggest technology initial public offering (IPO) in New York since 1999. But many of the website\u2019s artisan traders complain that the highly principled company is selling out its ideals for a quick buck. The Brooklyn-based company, founded in 2005 by painter, carpenter and photographer Rob Kalin after he struggled to find anywhere to sell his handmade wooden computers, is expected to this month file for an IPO that could value it at about $2bn. While many of Etsy\u2019s sellers are excited about the opportunity to buy shares, others worry that floating on the stock market goes against the website\u2019s founding purpose, as a community to help struggling artists sell their work \u2013 not a vehicle to make big profits for investors. \u201cEtsy is betraying its original artists by selling out to make money,\u201d said Joy Appenzeller Bauer, an artist who has been selling her work on Etsy since 2009. \u201cFinancially this may make some people very rich, but it is not what Etsy was meant to be about. Artists and crafters are now just window dressing to give the website the appearance that [items] are handmade, but in most cases they are not. They have become the online version of Pottery Barn.\u201d Appenzeller Bauer, from Chicago, claimed Etsy\u2019s future was being driven by the interests of its shareholders, including venture capitalists Accel Partners, Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have anything to do with art or Rob [Kalin]\u2019s vision. This is just a way for them to cash in. If I were an investor I would be worried that the [Etsy] community is very concerned and angry about the IPO plans.\u201d Jessica Kennedy, who sells vintage tablecloths and napkins on Etsy from her home in San Francisco, said she thought the IPO plans were great for Etsy and the company would be \u201csmart enough not to change how it operates to keep sellers and customers happy\u201d. \u201cI know a lot of the members are angry and complaining,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they [Etsy] have been very smart in how they\u2019ve conducted business. I think it [the IPO] will be good for the members. But Etsy is not that great at communication in general, and telling us how they are changing things.\u201d Kennedy said she would definitely buy shares in the company if and when it floats. \u201cGiven the opportunity to buy shares absolutely I will,\u201d she said. Cat Gibson, who sells vintage items from her home in Austin, Texas, said going for an IPO was the logical thing for Etsy to do as the company grows, but said she worried that going public will force the company to change. \u201cI would applaud it [the IPO], but I wouldn\u2019t want the company to have to answer to the shareholders,\u201d said Gibson, 60. \u201cIt will almost have to become an eBay in order to satisfy shareholders. It\u2019s almost already happened anyway. Etsy was meant to be an alternative to eBay.\u201d What Etsy\u2019s sellers think of the company\u2019s IPO plans matters. Etsy made $1.35bn in sales in 2013 by charging sellers 20 cents per listing and a 3.5% commission on sales. Etsy does not publish its profit figures, but has said it has turned a profit since 2009.

The company has twice parted ways with Kalin, its founder and former chief executive, following disagreements over the direction of the company. Kalin, who could not be reached for comment, has said trying to maximise shareholder value was \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run a company where you had to use that as an excuse for why it was doing things,\u201d he said in an interview with Inc.com.

      "body": "<p>Etsy, the online marketplace popular with hipsters across the globe, is preparing for the biggest technology initial public offering (IPO) in New York since 1999. But many of the website\u2019s artisan traders complain that the highly principled company is selling out its ideals for a quick buck.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/14/etsy-ipo\">Etsy reportedly preparing $300m IPO</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Brooklyn-based company, founded in 2005 by painter, carpenter and photographer Rob Kalin after he struggled to find anywhere to sell his handmade wooden computers, is expected to this month file for an IPO that could value it at about $2bn.</p> <p>While many of Etsy\u2019s sellers are excited about the opportunity to buy shares, others worry that floating on the stock market goes against the website\u2019s founding purpose, as a community to help struggling artists sell their work \u2013 not a vehicle to make big profits for investors. </p> <p>\u201cEtsy is betraying its original artists by selling out to make money,\u201d said Joy Appenzeller Bauer, an artist who has been selling her work on Etsy since 2009.</p> <p>\u201cFinancially this may make some people very rich, but it is not what Etsy was meant to be about. Artists and crafters are now just window dressing to give the website the appearance that [items] are handmade, but in most cases they are not. They have become the online version of Pottery Barn.\u201d</p> <p>Appenzeller Bauer, from Chicago, claimed Etsy\u2019s future was being driven by the interests of its shareholders, including venture capitalists Accel Partners, Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures. </p> <p>\u201cThese people don\u2019t have anything to do with art or Rob [Kalin]\u2019s vision. This is just a way for them to cash in. If I were an investor I would be worried that the [Etsy] community is very concerned and angry about the IPO plans.\u201d </p> <p>Jessica Kennedy, who sells vintage tablecloths and napkins on Etsy from her home in San Francisco, said she thought the IPO plans were great for Etsy and the company would be \u201csmart enough not to change how it operates to keep sellers and customers happy\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI know a lot of the members are angry and complaining,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they [Etsy] have been very smart in how they\u2019ve conducted business. I think it [the IPO] will be good for the members. But Etsy is not that great at communication in general, and telling us how they are changing things.\u201d</p> <p>Kennedy said she would definitely buy shares in the company if and when it floats. \u201cGiven the opportunity to buy shares absolutely I will,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/people/gsalehunter?ref=pr_profile\">Cat Gibson</a>, who sells vintage items from her home in Austin, Texas, said going for an IPO was the logical thing for Etsy to do as the company grows, but said she worried that going public will force the company to change. </p> <p>\u201cI would applaud it [the IPO], but I wouldn\u2019t want the company to have to answer to the shareholders,\u201d said Gibson, 60. \u201cIt will almost have to become an eBay in order to satisfy shareholders. It\u2019s almost already happened anyway. Etsy was meant to be an alternative to eBay.\u201d</p> <p>What Etsy\u2019s sellers think of the company\u2019s IPO plans matters. Etsy made $1.35bn in sales in 2013 by charging sellers 20 cents per listing and a 3.5% commission on sales. Etsy does not publish its profit figures, but has said it has turned a profit since 2009.

    "webTitle": "UK growth to pick up as cheaper oil cheers consumers, CBI says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Low oil prices and inflation will help Britain record its fastest growth since the financial crisis, according to the CBI. The employers\u2019 lobby group has upgraded its outlook for 2015 on the back of falling costs for households and businesses, echoing comments by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, last week that the slump in crude oil prices was \u201cunambiguously positive\u201d for the global economy and for the UK. As oil prices have halved since a $115-a-barrel peak last summer, the CBI now expects the UK economy to grow by 2.7% this year, up from its 2.5% forecast in November. This would mean greater GDP growth than in 2014, when the economy expanded 2.6%, its fastest pace since 2007. The brighter outlook for growth provides a fillip to the Tories as they head towards May\u2019s general election on a promise to shore up the economic recovery and boost living standards after years of falling real wages. But there were stark warnings that political volatility at home and abroad was hurting business confidence, with the election expected to be one of the most closely fought in recent times and with Greece in tense talks on its debt repayment plan. \u201cFalling unemployment coupled with improving wage growth and rock bottom inflation should mean that people see more money in their pockets. But businesses are looking on anxiously as insecurity continues to troll the eurozone and instability remains elsewhere,\u201d said Katja Hall, the CBI deputy director general. The business group expects consumer price inflation (CPI) to stay below 1% throughout most of 2015 and household spending to continue to provide much of the momentum in the UK economy. But in the latest blow to the government\u2019s hopes of rebalancing the economy away from overreliance on consumers, the CBI\u2019s forecasts \u201cunderwhelming\u201d growth in manufacturing and little help from exports. The Treasury, however, described the lCBI forecasts as \u201cfurther proof that our long-term economic plan is working\u201d. A spokeswoman added: \u201cThis is welcome news for households and families, but the job is not yet done so we must keep working through the plan that is delivering economic security in an uncertain world economy.\u201d The CBI\u2019s forecast is the same as that from the International Monetary Fund in January. The CBI\u2019s optimism about real wages growing again comes before official figures this week that are expected to show inflation eased further last month. After hitting a 14-year low of 0.5% in December, inflation was probably even softer, at 0.3%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. Separate official figures later in the week are expected to show annual wage growth holding at 1.7% in the three months to December. The recent pickup in pay for some workers follows years of average wages falling in real terms, and Labour politicians say the \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d is far from over with working people \u00a31,600 a year worse off since 2010. Analysis on Monday claims wage stagnation will cost the Treasury at least \u00a333bn in revenue. The TUC said if growth in earnings had been in line with a forecast made in June 2010 by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, income tax and national insurance receipts would total \u00a3308.4bn in 2015. But the Treasury is now expected to collect \u00a3275bn, according to the analysis carried out for the TUC by thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe chancellor has failed to reduce the deficit because of his failure to get wages growing. He spent the last five years shrinking pay packets and as a result he plans to spend the next five shrinking the state to a level not seen since the 1930s.\u201d Prime minister David Cameron was criticised last week for borrowing the TUC\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cBritain needs a pay rise\u201d as he urged business leaders to use lower energy costs to increase wages. Critics said the prime minister\u2019s focus on short-term price moves failed to address the underlying problem of Britain\u2019s poor record on productivity. There is fresh criticism on Monday from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), whose latest labour market survey reveals an increasing divide between companies that can now afford to increase wages by 2% or more and those that are stuck in a pay freeze. Gerwyn Davies, labour market analyst for the CIPD, highlighted a link between those employers able to raise pay and how much importance they placed on good management and investing in employees. \u201cProductivity lies at the heart of an organisation\u2019s ability to increase real wages above the rate of inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, the role for government is not to cajole business into giving more generous pay awards on the back of stronger economic growth and lower costs, but to understand the levers that can help more firms increase their workplace productivity and move up the quality chain.\u201d",

Separate official figures later in the week are expected to show annual wage growth holding at 1.7% in the three months to December.</p> <p>The recent pickup in pay for some workers follows years of average wages falling in real terms, and Labour politicians say the \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d is far from over with working people \u00a31,600 a year worse off since 2010.<br></p> <p>Analysis on Monday claims wage stagnation will cost the Treasury at least \u00a333bn in revenue.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/\">TUC</a> said if growth in earnings had been in line with a forecast made in June 2010 by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, income tax and national insurance receipts would total \u00a3308.4bn in 2015. But the Treasury is now expected to collect \u00a3275bn, according to the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/The%20living%20standards%20tax%20gap%20just%20got%20bigger%20FINAL.pdf\">analysis</a> carried out for the TUC by thinktank the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/\">Institute for Public Policy Research</a>.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe chancellor has failed to reduce the deficit because of his failure to get wages growing. He spent the last five years shrinking pay packets and as a result he plans to spend the next five shrinking the state to a level not seen since the 1930s.\u201d<br></p> <p>Prime minister David Cameron was criticised last week for borrowing the TUC\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cBritain needs a pay rise\u201d as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/10/david-cameron-urges-business-pay-rises-thwart-labour\">urged business leaders to use lower energy costs to increase wages</a>. Critics said the prime minister\u2019s focus on short-term price moves failed to address the underlying problem of Britain\u2019s poor record on productivity.</p> <p>There is fresh criticism on Monday from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (<a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/system/homepage2.aspx\">CIPD</a>), whose latest <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/survey-reports/labour-market-outlook-winter-2014-15.aspx\">labour market survey</a> reveals an increasing divide between companies that can now afford to increase wages by 2% or more and those that are stuck in a pay freeze.</p> <p>Gerwyn Davies, labour market analyst for the CIPD, highlighted a link between those employers able to raise pay and how much importance they placed on good management and investing in employees.</p> <p>\u201cProductivity lies at the heart of an organisation\u2019s ability to increase real wages above the rate of inflation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, the role for government is not to cajole business into giving more generous pay awards on the back of stronger economic growth and lower costs, but to understand the levers that can help more firms increase their workplace productivity and move up the quality chain.\u201d</p>",
