      "bodyText": "Sky has said it will review the future of Sky News if 21st Century Fox\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of the broadcaster is blocked on the grounds of media plurality. Fox\u2019s bid for Sky is currently being investigated by the Competition Markets Authority with particular reference to the Murdochs\u2019 commitment to broadcasting standards, and the deal\u2019s impact on media plurality. The CMA has said in its issues statement that if the deal is blocked its assumption is that Sky News will continue to compete against rival news organisations including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. Sky responded to the statement, which set out the scope of the CMA\u2019s six-month investigation, by saying: \u201cThe CMA should not simply assume the \u2018continued provision of Sky News\u2019 and its current contribution to plurality, \u2018absent the transaction\u2019. \u201cSky would likely be prompted to review the position in the event that the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky\u2019s broader business,\u201d Sky said in a five-page submission to the CMA published on Tuesday. The CMA must evaluate whether Fox\u2019s bid to take full control of Sky \u2013 leading to the Murdochs\u2019 controlling the Times, Sunday Times, Sun, Wall Street Journal and Sky News \u2013 would result in a reduction in the plurality of news available to UK consumers. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, referred the proposed takeover to the CMA in September. The media regulator, Ofcom, had already raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over the two options for solving media plurality issues, known as behaviourial and structural remedies. In June, Ofcom said a full structural spinoff of Sky News, which was accepted as a remedy at the time of the last bid in 2011, would not solve the issue this time. The media regulator was concerned that the loss-making Sky News was likely to become a smaller operation if run as a separate business, and could therefore make the situation worse. Ofcom also rejected Fox\u2019s proposal of a behavioural remedy: the appointment of independent board members at Sky News and a five-year funding guarantee. But the regulator gave Fox a potential fix by suggesting it could strengthen its initial proposal by extending the funding offer \u2013 the aborted 2011 deal came with a 10-year funding guarantee that was accepted by ministers \u2013 and beefing up its plans for board independence. The CMA is due to publish the provisional findings of its investigation in December.",

      "bodyText": "It used to be said that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire would not survive intact beyond the founder\u2019s lifetime. Now, it seems, it may not get that far. The stunning news is that Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox held talks with Disney about a sale of the bulk of its business \u2013 the movie studio, TV production and the international operations including the 39% stake in Sky in the UK. All that would remain would be Fox\u2019s broadcast network and its news and sports assets in the US \u2013 a substantial operation in its own right, but not the stuff of empires. The talks with Disney are said to have failed over price, but that factor can always change. If Murdoch has truly concluded that Fox can\u2019t compete against today\u2019s bigger media battalions, other bidders will circle. Fox\u2019s shares rose 10% on Monday, expecting a contest. Murdoch has, in effect, advertised that he\u2019s a seller. This turn of events is extraordinary. We had assumed Murdoch\u2019s attempt to seize 100% of Sky was a prelude to one last, and bigger, deal \u2013 a final expansionary adventure before control was fully passed to sons Lachlan and James. Selling is also entirely out of character: Murdoch rarely does tactical retreats. This one, if it happens, would be forced by events. Plan A for Murdoch was a takeover of Time Warner but the attempt in 2014 was a flop. The initial $80bn (\u00a360bn) bid was too low. Warner also made hay with the argument that Fox\u2019s non-voting shares were a second-class currency that gave the Murdoch family too much control; investors seemed to agree. The Warner episode was a brutal demonstration of Fox\u2019s limited financial muscle in a world where US media companies are combining and getting bigger. Disney, for example, is worth $170bn, against Fox\u2019s $50bn. Meanwhile, Fox\u2019s ability to conduct share-based deals \u2013 as opposed to the \u00a311.7bn cash offer for Sky \u2013 has continued to wither. Its share price is lower than it was at the time of the Warner failure. That reflects the market\u2019s view that media tides are running against Fox. Netflix and Amazon are changing viewing habits with their direct-to-consumer models. Disney will see an opportunity to slam Fox\u2019s film and TV assets into its own ESPN operation to take on Netflix with a new streaming service. But the same strategy wouldn\u2019t work in reverse: Fox is too small to bulk up now. \u201c21st Century Fox is embracing industry transformation head-on,\u201d declared Rupert and Lachlan, the joint chairmen in the last annual report. It sounded like fighting talk \u2013 it now reads more like wishful thinking. If the Murdoch empire is really to be shrunk, there is a long list of follow-on questions. What happens to the Sky bid? How would the rump Fox be run? And how would the Murdoch succession be affected? The answers are all as clear as mud. Any new owner of the 39% of Sky is formally obliged to continue with the bid, but there\u2019s scope to let the clock run down. As for Fox, it would be hard to re-combine it with the UK newspaper business, which was detached in 2013 after the phone-hacking scandal: Murdoch might be willing to gather all the news assets under one roof, but would struggle to convince US shareholders. And succession, who knows? If you offered James any slice of the current stable of assets to run, Fox News would probably be the very last he\u2019d choose. The Murdoch family drama rolls on. SSE job cuts loom as it plans to offload retail Here\u2019s one corporate solution to the looming price cap on energy bills: hand your troubled retail supply business to your shareholders via a demerger. SSE\u2019s plan to shuffle off its household energy supply business comes with a novel twist. On the way to a separate stock market listing, the demerged operation will collect npower\u2019s smaller and poorer supply business. In combination, the scope for cost savings should be greater. So, even in the new world of price caps, it might be possible to squeeze out a few dividends for shareholders from a total customer base of 13 million. Those investors who are still sceptical at least get the chance to sell their stock. That, at least, is one happy-ish reading. An alternative view is that the mash-up is a case of two weak businesses leaning on each other for support. The npower operation is loss-making and its German owners have always seemed more interested in their power generation assets in the UK, which are not part of the deal. Household supply is more important for SSE but is still expected to contribute only 15% of group profits this year, so this is hardly a case of demerging the family silver. Generation, renewables and the networks business are SSE\u2019s bigger assets. The need for SSE to do something, however, is obvious: among big suppliers, it has the biggest proportion of customers on standard variable tariffs, the ones that will be capped. The other imperative is to move quickly in case other members of the big six get the same idea about combining. Competition regulators might tolerate a big five, especially if SSE and npower can produce a plausible case that they will compete harder as a result, but a four would be tricky. In the meantime, SSE says it will be \u201cmindful\u201d of the \u201cconcerns of employees\u201d. Very sweet, but the proposed deal only makes financial sense if you\u2019re intending to cut jobs.

      "bodyText": "I read with a sense of deja vu the letter by Tim Worstall (6 November) in which he suggested that charging zero tariffs on imports would make us richer. I\u2019m still confused about how this might be the case. True, charging zero tariffs on foreign goods should make them cheaper, provided that we ignore the drop in the value of the pound associated with Brexit (which, of course, makes imported goods more expensive), but how do we pay for these goods if other countries insist on tariffs on our products, potentially reducing our exports? Further, as tariffs are a form of tax, how might we compensate for the loss of revenue? Surely zero import tariffs with existing export tariffs would adversely affect our trade balance, and make the country \u2013 or at least those of us who are not rich \u2013 poorer. Imports alone do not generate wealth for any but the few rich importers. Or is that the point? It would seem to be logical that it is not imports that is the problem in post-Brexit British trade, but exports, with the tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Karl Jones Liverpool \u2022 As a business that has long struggled with high EU import tariffs making us uncompetitive, I was interested to read your piece suggesting families could see \u00a3930 a year added to their shopping bill (Cost of Brexit: \u00a3930 a year on shopping bills, 4 November). Our understanding is that the UK government will have consumer welfare as a top priority when making choices about post-Brexit legislation. That is why the recently published customs and trade white papers propose giving the government the tools to lower tariffs and establish tariff rate quotas \u2013 to avoid the outcome the article predicts. World Trade Organization rules do not \u201crequire\u201d the UK to apply the European Union\u2019s maximum import tariff. Members are free to apply that as a maximum, or anything below that, down to zero \u2013 either permanently or temporarily. Of course, these decisions will need to be balanced against their impact on UK farmers. But it is wrong to suggest that the government is planning to penalise poor families in the event of no deal with the EU, especially if the only other reason to do it is to keep bargaining chips for some future far-off free trade agreement negotiation.

I\u2019m still confused about how this might be the case.</p> <p>True, charging zero tariffs on foreign goods should make them cheaper, provided that we ignore the drop in the value of the pound associated with Brexit (which, of course, makes imported goods more expensive), but how do we pay for these goods if other countries insist on tariffs on our products, potentially reducing our exports? Further, as tariffs are a form of tax, how might we compensate for the loss of revenue?</p> <p>Surely zero import tariffs with existing export tariffs would adversely affect our trade balance, and make the country \u2013 or at least those of us who are not rich \u2013 poorer. Imports alone do not generate wealth for any but the few rich importers. Or is that the point?</p> <p>It would seem to be logical that it is not imports that is the problem in post-Brexit British trade, but exports, with the tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.<br><strong>Karl Jones</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a business that has long struggled with high EU import tariffs making us uncompetitive, I was interested to read your piece suggesting families could see \u00a3930 a year added to their shopping bill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/03/no-deal-brexit-could-add-930-a-year-to-uk-shopping-bills-say-experts\" title=\"\">Cost of Brexit: \u00a3930 a year on shopping bills</a>, 4 November).</p> <p>Our understanding is that the UK government will have consumer welfare&#xa0;as a top priority when making choices about post-Brexit legislation. That is why the recently published customs and trade white papers propose giving the government the tools to lower tariffs and establish tariff rate quotas \u2013 to avoid the outcome the article&#xa0;predicts.</p> <p>World Trade Organization rules do not \u201crequire\u201d the UK to apply the European Union\u2019s maximum import tariff. Members are free to apply that as a maximum, or anything below that, down to zero \u2013 either permanently or temporarily.</p> <p>Of course, these decisions will need to be balanced against their impact on UK farmers. But it is wrong to suggest that the government is planning to penalise poor families in the event of no deal with the EU, especially if the only other reason to do it is to keep bargaining chips for some future far-off free trade agreement negotiation.<br><strong>Gerald Mason</strong><br><em>Senior vice-president, Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This mornings\u2019s weak retail sales report helped to deprive us of another record closing high on the FTSE 100. The blue-chip closed down 49 points at 7513. Other European markets also dropped. Next, M&amp;S both shed 1% and Kingfisher lost 2.9%, while security firm G4S tumbled 4.7% after lowering its forecasts. Tomorrow M&amp;as releases its own sales figures, so traders will be keen to discover how it is faring..... On that note, goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting. GW SSE\u2019s hopes of combining its UK operations with nPower could fall foul of comjpetition authorities. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons these concerns could sink the deal. He says: Cutting the big six down to a big five would hardly help competition, which is exactly what the government wants. A merger would create the UK\u2019s largest household energy supplier with a 24% market share, ahead of British Gas\u2019s 22%. The problem and arguably the rationale is that the big six are losing customers at a record pace to smaller suppliers. Smaller suppliers now account for more than 8% of market share, up from 1% just three years ago, according to Ofgem data. The big six also face a hit from price caps \u2013 consolidation has its appeal in this kind of environment \u2013 just look at the gambling industry\u2019s raft of deals. Npower has been on the ropes for some time, racking up losses and losing customers quickly following well documented customer service troubles and higher costs. Cost cutting has been severe but not enough to full offset worsening market conditions and reduced margins. Profits in the first half fell 114% from a year ago and it\u2019s on course for a third consecutive annual loss. Years of problems have led to restructuring but it\u2019s clearly not working quickly enough. There\u2019s big news in the British energy market this afternoon, with SSE and npower announcing plans to create a new UK energy provider. If they succeed, it would leave Britain with just five major suppliers. That could threaten competition at a time when public anger over rising energy bills is palpable. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: SSE and npower, two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies, are planning to combine their household energy supply businesses in a potentially seismic shake-up of the market. The two firms said they are in well-advanced talks to create a new independent energy supply firm. The new business would combine the 13 million customers they currently supply with electricity and gas. If the move goes ahead it would see the end of two of the biggest brands in the energy retail market, and is likely to raise competition concerns as the so-called big six that own 80% of the energy market shrinks to the \u201cbig five\u201d.... More here: Over in New York, the main US stock indices have hit new record highs at the start of trading. The long equities rally has driven world stock markets to a new record high. The MSCI All-Country World Index burst through the 500-point mark for the first time today. That follows a series of record highs on Wall Street, and yesterday\u2019s rally in London which pushed the FTSE 100 to a record close. Earlier today, Japan\u2019s Nikkei also popped higher to its highest closing point in 25 years. Investors are in an optimistic mood following after a series of big companies beat expectations recently (Apple, Amazon, Caterpillar, Mastercard, BP and Goldman Sachs to name but a few). Perhaps surprisingly, the rally has continued despite some central banks preparing to unwind their monetary stimulus programme. Government bond prices have also rallied in recent years, of course, as this chart from g+ Economics shows: G+\u2019s Lena Komileva says the financial universe has \u201ctilted in recent months\u201d, with the US Federal Reserve unwinding its balance sheet, the ECB slowing its quantitative easing scheme next year, and the Bank of England raising interest rates last week. She warns that there could be volatility ahead, as the process of normalising monetary policy continues. Global bonds - equity correlations have been virtually 1 over the past year (see above chart), following virtually uninterrupted linear growth, pretty much void of volatility, despite historically tight credit spreads and a growing negative-yield bonds universe. This is the type of artificial liquidity environment where asset bubbles and systemic crises are born. As QE tapering gets underway expect a gradual pivot in market sensitivity back towards domestic fundamentals and real risk pricing. It is little surprise that central banks want to exit the current markets environment and follow a return to normal economic activity with policy normalisation, as fast as possible, without putting reflation objectives at risk. Over in Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has reacted furiously to claims \u2013 issued by parliament\u2019s state budget office no less \u2013 that the country faces economic collapse if its staggering debt load is not substantially reduced. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens The budget office\u2019s dramatic warning that bankrupcy looms unless Greece gets debt relief was dismissed outright by Tsakalotos. In comments to the leftwing daily, Efimerida twn Syntakton, the Greek finance minister described the claim as a \u201cmistake\u201d based on \u201coutdated figures.\u201d \u201cThis is a error,\u201d he said insisting that the office had been lead to the wrong conclusions on account of \u201cerroneous calculations\u201d over the amount of debt repayments Greece will be called to make between 2021 and 2026. In a subsequent announcement the finance ministry said the House office had employed data from 2013 before short-term debt relief measures were agreed by eurogroup finance ministers in May 2016 and when the interest rates on payments was much higher. Parliament\u2019s president Nikos Voutsis went further accusing the state budget office of fear-mongering, saying: \u201cI am surprised at the use of invalid data and ensuing public relations stunt.\u201d In its quarterly report released Monday the budget office warned that bankruptcy was inevitable because interest payments on maturing debt after 2021 were so high. \u201cWithout substantial debt relief, Greece will go bankrupt,\u201d it warned. At 180%, Greece has the highest debt to GDP ratio of any EU member state. But with less than a year to go before the country exits a third international bailout progamme, Athens\u2019 leftist-led coalition is keen to change the narrative to one of hope after years of gruelling austerity meted out in exchange for rescue funds. I mentioned earlier that house price shortages were keeping UK prices up.... ...and bang on cue, online estate agents HouseSimple.com have confirmed that this is an issue. Its Property Supply Index found that the total number of new properties marketed by estate agents across the UK fell by 4.3% in October. The number of listings fell in 75% of UK towns and cities, including a 37.4% drop in Torquay and 37.0% in Oxford. In Wolverhampton, property listings have fallen for five months in a row. Alex Gosling, CEO of online estate agents HouseSimple.com. says: \u201cThe housing market is in desperate need of a prolonged period of supply growth rather than isolated months where seller numbers rise, only to fall back the following month. We probably won\u2019t see numbers jump again this year, but steady levels in November and December would at least give the market a strong base going into the New Year, particularly with some heavy Brexit headwinds heading our way. This month\u2019s Black Friday sales will be crucial for UK retailers, especially as Amazon is gunning for them with 10 days of sales and a pop-up store in Soho. High Fletcher, global head of consultancy and innovation at consultancy firm Salmon says retailers might profit by launching their own promotions pronto.... A strong focus on digital and innovation will be vital for consumers wanting a quick and convenient service \u2013 the figures are suggesting, after all, a shift from buying items they want to rather buying items they need. As consumers increasingly flock online to purchase goods, retailers should be looking to start Black Friday sales sooner rather than later to boost the slump in non-food sales, perhaps by even creating their own \u2018peak days\u2019 to stave off the competition from Black Friday stalwarts such as Amazon. The next month or so will be a game-changer for many in the retail business. Shares in several major British retailers have dropped today, following the news that sales fell in October. Kingfisher, which operates the B&amp;Q DIY chain, and Marks &amp; Spencer are both among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. That has helped to pull the blue-chip index down by 16 points to 7546, denting hopes that we could see a record alltime high today. Security firm G4S are the biggest faller after downgrading its full-year sales growth forecasts this morning, guidance from between four and six per cent to three and four per cent. Associated British Foods are also out of favour, after warning this morning that sugar profits would fall in 2017-2018 due to lower EU prices. That has taken the shine off Primark\u2019s decent performance. Incidentally, Primark\u2019s UK sales rose by 10% on a total basis, not a like-for like basis as I wrote earlier (now corrected). In another sign that shoppers are cutting back, sales at John Lewis\u2019s department stores fell by 3.7% last week compared to a year earlier. Takings in the seven days to 4th November fell to \u00a3102.03m, from \u00a3105.98m in 2016. Homeware sales shank by 7% and electrical and home technology takings tumbled by 8.4% -- despite the iPhone X launch boosting mobile phone sales. The spooky season provided some cheer, though; John Lewis\u2019s Halloween sales jumped by 24% year on year. One week\u2019s sales can be deceptive, but this chart shows that sales have been lagging 2016 for several weeks now... Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis group, reported a 0.5% drop in total sales last week. Eurozone retail sales have beaten forecasts, in another sign that Europe\u2019s economy is strengthening. Eurozone retail sales jumped by 0.7% in September, according to new figures from Eurostat. On an annual basis ,sales volumes were 3.7% higher than a year ago. In contrast, retail sales across the UK shrank by 0.8% in September, according to figures released last month. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, agrees that the shortage of UK houses are keeping prices up. On the face of it, these figures are quite encouraging because they continue to demonstrate the market resilience that we have grown accustomed to over the past few months. However, when you look behind the numbers you realise that much of the growth is supported by continuing shortage of supply which we are also finding on the high street. \u2018Looking forward there is no doubt that people will continue to trade but more nervously, particularly in the light of higher mortgage costs and pressure on real income.\u2019 Every weekday morning, Business Today delivers the biggest stories, smartest analysis and hottest topics direct to your inbox.

The drop in retail sales last month shows that UK shoppers are holding onto their cash until they see a real bargain, says Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: She explains: \u201cDespite retailers best efforts it\u2019s not surprising households have tightened their purse strings in light of inflation rising and the lack of wage growth. Everyone is dubious about parting with their cash \u201cjust in case\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re coming into what is typically the busiest period of the year for retailers, however bargain blindness has hit the retail sector hard as the expectation of rock bottom prices means we\u2019re less and less willing to part with our cash if we have to pay full price. \u201cWe\u2019re less likely to buy and expect discounts which causes the perfect storm for retailers.\u201d Discount fashion chain Primark has defied the slowdown in UK retail sales. It has reported a 10% rise in sales across its British stores in the last year [corrected]. Parent company Associated British Foods says Primark\u2019s share of the UK clothing market \u201cincreased significantly\u201d -- suggesting it is grabbing sales from other retailers. After a good first half, third quarter trading was strong in the lead-up to Easter, with the growth also benefiting from comparison with prior year results that were affected by poor weather and an earlier Easter holiday. Fourth quarter trading was equally strong, fully reflecting the success of our consumer offering. This was driven by the ability of our buying, merchandising and design teams to identify and deliver key seasonal trends. The consumer response to our new autumn/winter range has been encouraging. In total, Primark posted a 14% rise in sales on a \u201cconstant currency\u201d basis (stripping out foreign exchange moves) across Europe and the US. Like-for-like sales were only up by 1% though If Halifax are right, then house prices are rising much faster than wages (up 2.1% in the last year) and interest rates (now 0.5%). Lucy Pendleton, Founder Director of independent estate agents James Pendleton, says the lack of supply of new homes is pushing prices up. Here\u2019s her take on the news that prices rose by 4.5% in the last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve since had a rate rise but what you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t one last hurrah as people rush to grab the best mortgage rates. It\u2019s that same old ball and chain around the UK property market\u2019s neck - weak supply. \u201cThe countdown on rates may have helped support demand but mortgage approvals were down. We know stiff competition for homes exists but to see approvals and prices diverge in such dramatic fashion is surprising. \u201cThere will also be an echo from September\u2019s back-to-work bounce, as deals brokered before the summer holidays complete in the Autumn, but such a strong second month is uncharacteristic and shows the market in surprisingly rude health.\u201d UK house price inflation has accelerated again, according to the latest survey from Halifax. The lender reports that house prices rose by 4.5% in the last quarter, compared to a year ago. That\u2019s up from 4% a month ago, and the fastest annual increase since February. During the month, prices picked up by 0.3%. It suggests that buyers weren\u2019t deterred by (accurate) predictions that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this week. These housing surveys can be volatile, so should be treated cautiously. Last week, Nationwide also reported that house prices had risen -- but only at an annual rate of 2.5%. Brits may be cutting back on clothes, but they\u2019re still finding money for essentials such as, err, posh tonic water. Fever-Tree, the upmarket mixer maker, has told the City that its results this year will be \u2018materially\u2019 ahead of market expectations. It looks like its 5th profit upgrade this year The company, founded just 12 years ago, reckons that it\u2019s dominating the rest of the market, saying: The exceptional performance in the UK, the Group\u2019s largest market, has been particularly impressive with the rate of sales growth and momentum strong across both the on and off trade. The mixer category is now the fastest growing category across the UK soft drinks sector with Fever-Tree responsible for 97% of the value growth in retail over the last 12 months. Shares have jumped 10% in early trading, to \u00a321.40. Three years ago they floated at just 134p.... UK fashion retailer New Look has also reported a drop in sales over the last six months, another sign that the sector is going through a tough patch. New Look posted a loss after tax of \u00a372.7m for the six months to 23rd September this morning, after suffering a 4.5% drop in revenues. The retailer firm also revealed that Alistair McGeorge, former boss, been parachuted in as executive Chairman. McGeorge says: \u201cToday\u2019s results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK high street. Whilst we\u2019re not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight, I am confident we will implement the necessary changes to get the company back on track. Today\u2019s financial results, though, show that McGeorge has a challenge on his hands: Revenue -4.5% to \u00a3686.0m (H1 FY17: \u00a3718.1m) New Look Brand like-for-like sales -8.6% UK like-for-like sales -8.4% Own website sales -7.6% Third Party E-commerce sales +17.0% Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, says the drop in UK retail sales in October is a \u201creal disappointment\u201d \u201cClothing sales were particularly hard hit. After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year. Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular. He suggests that customers might be holding back until the \u2018Black Friday\u2019 deals arrive. \u201cOverall growth online was lacklustre at best, although health and beauty products continued to stand out as a strong performer. The burning questions for retailers will be whether shoppers are holding off their purchases until Black Friday, and whether retailers can recover from this month\u2019s poor performance to end the year on a high. Black Friday (an idea imported from America) lands on 24th November, so we\u2019ll soon know whether October\u2019s meagre pickings were just a blip or something more serious.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The storm clouds gathering over the UK\u2019s retail sector have darkened, with a new survey showing that Brits cut back last month. Retail sales shrank by 1.0% on a like-for-like basis in October, compared to a year ago, according to the British Retail Consortium. Worryingly, non-food retail sales shrank by 0.4% over the last quarter on a like-for-like basis -- the worst reading since the BRC started counting in January 2011. That includes a 2.9% slump in sales of non-food items within stores (rather than online). Although food sales did rise, the report is another indication that Britain\u2019s consumers are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, and economic uncertainty. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, says the report will alarm shop owners: \u201cIt was a meagre month in October for retail sales as shopping activity slumped. With total growth at its lowest since May and below the 12-month average, retailers will have cause for concern as they prepare for the crucial run up to Christmas. \u201cThe decline was driven by the worst performance of non-food sales since our record began in January 2011, as consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops. The growth in food sales meanwhile, adds some colour to this otherwise anaemic picture, but these figures are very much buoyed by inflation. She blames the jump in inflation -- which hit 3% in September as the fall in the pound drove up import costs. \u201cReal consumer spending power has been on a downward trend in the last year as the acceleration in inflation has caused shoppers to become ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford. Many now face higher borrowing costs, given the rise in interest rates, which will only serve to heap further pressure onto household finances. Here\u2019s our report: Foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale isn\u2019t impressed either: Also coming up today.... European stock markets are expected to open higher, after the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high last night. We\u2019ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s property market when Halifax publishes its monthly house price figures. Trader will also be watching the oil price, which nudged a two-year high yesterday after last weekend\u2019s Saudi political shake-up. Overnight, US president Donald Trump backed Riyadh....

That includes a 2.9% slump in sales of non-food items within stores (rather than online).</p> <p>Although food sales did rise, the report is another indication that Britain\u2019s consumers are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, and economic uncertainty.</p> <p><strong>Helen Dickinson,</strong> chief executive of the <strong>British Retail Consortium</strong>, says the report will alarm shop owners:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt was a meagre month in October for retail sales as shopping activity slumped. With total growth at its lowest since May and below the 12-month average, retailers will have cause for concern as they prepare for the crucial run up to Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline was driven by the worst performance of non-food sales since our record began in January 2011, as consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops. The growth in food sales meanwhile, adds some colour to this otherwise anaemic picture, but these figures are very much buoyed by inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p>She blames the jump in inflation -- which hit 3% in September as the fall in the pound drove up import costs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cReal consumer spending power has been on a downward trend in the last year as the acceleration in inflation has caused shoppers to become ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford. Many now face higher borrowing costs, given the rise in interest rates, which will only serve to heap further pressure onto household finances.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s our report:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/retailers-budget-christmas-brc\">Retailers urge 'shoppers' budget' as figures point to squeeze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Foreign exchange expert <strong>Kit Juckes</strong> of <strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong> isn\u2019t impressed either:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/status/927778570734374913\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yipper Dee doo dah......not....UK retail sales falter in October \u2013 BRC <a href=\"https://t.co/BHHJ8oIg8k\">https://t.co/BHHJ8oIg8k</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fastFT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@fastFT</a></p>&mdash; Kit Juckes (@kitjuckes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/status/927778570734374913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Also coming up today....</h2> <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, after the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high last night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IpekOzkardeskay/status/927799636378533888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European opening call <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LCGTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LCGTrading</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$FTSE</a> +18 points at 7580<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$DAX</a> +42 points at 13510<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CAC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$CAC</a> +10 points at 5517<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IBEX</a> +42 points at 10358</p>&mdash; Ipek Ozkardeskaya (@IpekOzkardeskay) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IpekOzkardeskay/status/927799636378533888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>We\u2019ll get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s property market when Halifax publishes its monthly house price figures.</p> <p>Trader will also be watching the oil price, which nudged a two-year high yesterday after last weekend\u2019s Saudi political shake-up.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SSE and npower, two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies, are planning to combine their household energy supply businesses in a potentially seismic shake-up of the market. The two firms said they were in well-advanced talks to create a new independent energy supply firm. The new business would combine the nearly 13 million customers they currently supply with electricity and gas. If the move goes ahead it would see the end of two of the biggest brands in the energy retail market, and is likely to raise competition concerns as the so-called big six that own 80% of the energy market shrinks to the \u201cbig five\u201d. The combination of German-owned npower and UK-listed SSE, Britain\u2019s second biggest supplier, would create a behemoth of a similar size to the current market leader, British Gas. SSE\u2019s share price jumped by more than 3% as the possible deal was announced. Both companies have opposed the government\u2019s plans for a price cap on energy prices, which Theresa May has said she is imposing to end \u201crip-off\u201d standard variable tariffs. Among the big six, SSE has the highest percentage of customers on such poor-value tariffs. The firms said the new company would be listed on the London Stock Exchange but stressed no final decisions had yet been taken. \u201cThe discussions between SSE and [npower owner] Innogy are continuing and are well-advanced but no final decisions have been taken and no binding agreements regarding the terms of any combination have been entered into,\u201d SSE said in a statement to the Stock Exchange. The company added that it was mindful of the impact on staff and customers, and would inform them of developments as soon as possible. The big six suppliers have been haemorrhaging customers over the past few years in the face of cheaper, more digital savvy and greener energy companies. These new operators now have 20% market share, up from 1% a decade ago. But the big six have still been piling up the profits as the companies cut costs and charged higher prices to customers who had not switched away from standard variable tariffs. While SSE made a substantial profit margin of 6.9% in 2016, npower reported an operating loss of \u00a390m last year as it lost nearly 80,000 customers and struggled to get a grip on costs. Industry figures had previously said the brand had become so tarnished that a rebrand was likely. Experts said that SSE stood to benefit the most. \u201cWe see this as a positive move for SSE and Innogy, although the relative scale of the UK supply operations within both entities means SSE is significantly more exposed to any upside,\u201d said analysts at RBC Capital Markets. If the merger does go ahead, the newly-created supplier would have nearly 12.7 million customers, putting it within touching distance of the current biggest supplier, British Gas, which has 13.7 million. Industry figures said that because the new entity would not be bigger than British Gas, it was unlikely to be blocked by the government\u2019s competition watchdog. They said that the move was probably driven by an attempt to cut costs through economies of scale but warned the two firms were likely to face problems integrating their IT systems. This week SSE wrote to Greg Clark, the business secretary, informing him that from the next financial year it was going to stop rolling customers on to standard variable tariffs when their fixed deals come to an end. In the longer term, it said it was considering dumping standard variable tariffs entirely. One comparison site said the move could potentially benefit npower customers. \u201cThis merger could in fact be good news for customers. SSE currently have lower prices than npower as well as better service levels,\u201d said Mark Todd of Energyhelpline. Octopus Energy, a challenger supplier, said the mooted merger cemented the case for price caps. Greg Jackson, the firm\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThis clearly strengthens the need for government action on pricing in energy. Both of these companies are ones with questionable customer records \u2013 npower has the highest standard variable tariff, and SSE have the highest proportion of customers on standard variable tariffs.\u201d A spokeswoman for energy regulator Ofgem said it would not rule on the potential merger: \u201cOur role is to represent the interest of consumers. It is not part of our jurisdiction to decide on a merger. However, we would advise relevant authorities if we were concerned that a merger would not be in consumers\u2019 interests.\u201d The announcement comes as industry data shows that more than 600,000 people switched energy supplier in October, up 10% on the month before. A third of those switching moved to smaller suppliers. A poll by Opinium for challenger firm PurePlanet has found that half of customers with the big six are considering ditching them for another supplier. For households with British Gas, which hiked its prices in September, 29% are thinking of leaving in the next six months, the research found. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

Among the big six, SSE has the highest percentage of customers on such poor-value tariffs.</p> <p>The firms said the new company would be listed on the London Stock Exchange but stressed no final decisions had yet been taken.</p> <p>\u201cThe discussions between SSE and [npower owner] Innogy are continuing and are well-advanced but no final decisions have been taken and no binding agreements regarding the terms of any combination have been entered into,\u201d SSE said in a statement to the Stock Exchange.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T14:10:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Electricity supplier market shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T14:10:16/embed.html\">Electricity supplier market shares</a> </figure>  <p>The company added that it was mindful of the impact on staff and customers, and would inform them of developments as soon as possible.</p> <p>The big six suppliers have been haemorrhaging customers over the past few years in the face of cheaper, more digital savvy and greener energy companies. These new operators now have 20% market share, up from 1% a decade ago.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/31/big-energy-firms-profit-profit-ofgem-big-six-electricity-gas-switch\">big six have still been piling up the profits</a> as the companies cut costs and charged higher prices to customers who had not switched away from standard variable tariffs.</p> <p>While SSE made a substantial profit margin of 6.9% in 2016, npower reported an operating loss of \u00a390m last year as it lost nearly 80,000 customers and struggled to get a grip on costs. Industry figures had previously said the brand had become so tarnished that a rebrand was likely.</p> <p>Experts said that SSE stood to benefit the most. \u201cWe see this as a positive move for SSE and Innogy, although the relative scale of the UK supply operations within both entities means SSE is significantly more exposed to any upside,\u201d said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T14:11:21/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Gas supplier market shares\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-20T14:11:21/embed.html\">Gas supplier market shares</a> </figure>  <p>If the merger does go ahead, the newly-created supplier would have nearly 12.7 million customers, putting it within touching distance of the current biggest supplier, British Gas, which has 13.7 million.</p> <p>Industry figures said that because the new entity would not be bigger than British Gas, it was unlikely to be blocked by the government\u2019s competition watchdog. </p> <p>They said that the move was probably driven by an attempt to cut costs through economies of scale but warned the two firms were likely to face problems integrating their IT systems.</p> <p>This week SSE wrote to Greg Clark, the business secretary, informing him that from the next financial year it was going to stop rolling customers on to standard variable tariffs when their fixed deals come to an end. In the longer term, it said it was considering dumping standard variable tariffs entirely.</p> <p>One comparison site said the move could potentially benefit npower customers. \u201cThis merger could in fact be good news for customers. SSE currently have lower prices than npower as well as better service levels,\u201d said Mark Todd of Energyhelpline.</p> <p>Octopus Energy, a challenger supplier, said the mooted merger cemented the case for price caps. Greg Jackson, the firm\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThis clearly strengthens the need for government action on pricing in energy. Both of these companies are ones with questionable customer records \u2013 npower has the highest standard variable tariff, and SSE have the highest proportion of customers on standard variable tariffs.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for energy regulator Ofgem said it would not rule on the potential merger: \u201cOur role is to represent the interest of consumers. It is not part of our jurisdiction to decide on a merger. However, we would advise relevant authorities if we were concerned that a merger would not be in consumers\u2019 interests.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement comes as industry data shows that more than 600,000 people switched energy supplier in October, up 10% on the month before. A third of those switching moved to smaller suppliers.</p> <p>A poll by Opinium for challenger firm PurePlanet has found that half of customers with the big six are considering ditching them for another supplier. For households with British Gas, which hiked its prices in September, 29% are thinking of leaving in the next six months, the research found.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Who are the big six?</h2> <h2><strong>SSE</strong></h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 7.7 million<br><strong>Who owns it:</strong> UK-listed<br><strong>Chief executive:</strong> Alistair Phillips-Davies<br><strong>Where it is based:</strong> Perth, Scotland<br><strong>Profits last year (earnings before interest and tax):</strong> \u00a31.54bn<br><strong>What they\u2019re in:</strong> Energy supply, generation and networks</p> <h2>Scottish Power</h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 5.2 million<br><strong>Who owns it:</strong> Iberdrola (Spain)<br><strong>Chief operating officer:</strong> Keith Anderson<br><strong>Where it is based: </strong>Glasgow<br><strong>Profits last year: </strong>\u00a31.25bn<br><strong>What they\u2019re in:</strong> Energy supply, generation and networks</p> <h2>npower</h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 5 million<br><strong>Who owns it: </strong>Innogy (Germany)<br><strong>Chief executive: </strong>Paul Coffey<br><strong>Where it is based:</strong> Swindon<br><strong>Profits last year:</strong> \u00a390m loss<br><strong>What they\u2019re in:</strong> Energy supply and generation</p> <h2>British Gas</h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 13.7 million<br><strong>Who owns it:</strong> Centrica<br><strong>Chief executive:</strong> Mark Hodges<br><strong>Where it is based:</strong> Staines-upon-Thames<br><strong>Profits last year:</strong> \u00a3574m (NB \u00a31.46bn for parent company Centrica)<br><strong>What they\u2019re in: </strong>Energy supply and generation</p> <h2>EDF Energy</h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 5.2 million<br><strong>Who owns it:</strong> \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (France)<br><strong>Chief executive:</strong> Simone Rossi<br><strong>Where it is based:</strong> London<br><strong>Profits last year:</strong> \u00a38m loss<br><strong>What they\u2019re in:</strong> Energy supply and generation</p> <h2><strong>E.ON</strong></h2> <p><strong>Number of customers:</strong> 6 million<br><strong>Who owns it:</strong> E.ON (Germany)<br><strong>Chief operating officer:</strong> Michael Lewis<br><strong>Where it is based:</strong> Coventry<br><strong>Profits last year:</strong> \u00a3337m<br><strong>What they\u2019re in:</strong> Energy supply and generation</p>",

But aficionados of Nutella are up in arms after discovering that the recipe has been secretly changed, with more sugar and fat \u2013 but fewer hazelnuts. Ferrero, Nutella\u2019s Italian manufacturer, admitted it had carried out \u201cfine-tuning\u201d but insisted the nutritional value of the new version was similar to its predecessor. The recipe tweaks had been spotted by the eagle-eyed German consumer group Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre and revealed on its Facebook page. It claimed the new recipe has increased the content of powdered skimmed milk from 7.5% to 8.7%, and sugar from 55.9% to 56.3%. Furious Nutella fans took to Twitter to criticise the changes, using the hashtag #boycottNutella. @RoshhNosh said: @AllesParr tweeted: Not a good idea to mess with #Nutella lovers! Another wrote: \u201cIf the rumours of #Nutella changing their recipe are true, I am boycotting them.\u201d And another fan said Ferrero \u201cshould be reducing sugar content in this day and age\u201d. In a statement Ferrero confirmed the changes had been made but insisted that \u201cthe quality ... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same\u201d. The nutritional content of Nutella has not been without controversy. Earlier this year fans were shocked by a \u201cdeconstructed\u201d photo of its raw ingredients \u2013 shown in layers of a jar \u2013 that revealed the high sugar content. \u201cWe are shocked to see Nutella has ramped up the amount of sugar in its already sweet product,\u201d said Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar. \u201cBased on their original formulation which has less sugar than the new formula, just two slices of bread with Nutella (24g sugar) contains the entire maximum daily intake of 7 to 10-year-olds. Eaten over the duration of a week that\u2019s 168g of sugar \u2013 the equivalent amount found in two and a half boxes of Maltesers (120g box). Nutella is high in sugar and should not be eaten every day.\u201d Nutella also contains palm oil, which causes concern because of possible links to cancer as well as its damaging environmental impact. But Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. Chocolate fans can be unsettled by tweaks to their favourite products. In November last year the confectionery giant Mondel\u0113z sparked uproar by changing the shape of the popular Toblerone bar, a move fans described as \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cjust plain dumb\u201d. And in 2015 consumers of Cadbury\u2019s Fruit &amp; Nut chocolate bars reacted with fury after the company changed the recipe for the first time in 90 years to include sultanas. Other recent changes to Jaffa Cakes and Walnut Whips have also irked devotees. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Is Xavier Rolet being forced out as London Stock Exchange chief? | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Did the board of the London Stock Exchange demand that its chief executive quit against his wishes? This simple question, you would assume, could be answered with little fuss. All that is required is an answer from either the chairman, Donald Brydon, or the chief executive himself, Xavier Rolet. Yet, more than a fortnight after the LSE announced that Rolet will leave at the end of next year, nobody wants to speak clearly. The silence makes one think the Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI) is on to something. It is the hedge fund and long-standing LSE shareholder that claims that Rolet has been hustled unhappily towards the exit under the guise of \u201csuccession planning\u201d. It thinks a better plan would be to keep him. There was certainly a weird aspect to how the LSE announced Rolet\u2019s exit last month. As pointed out here at the time, the group applauded the chief executive\u2019s \u201cremarkable achievements\u201d at length but didn\u2019t find space to address the central question: if he\u2019s so good, why\u2019s he going? It\u2019s a fair question. Rolet is only 57 and his nine years as boss are widely regarded as a huge success. The share price has improved from 500p to \u00a338 on his watch and the LSE these days is a broader-spread \u00a314bn operation. Now that TCI is threatening to call a meeting of shareholders to try to unseat Brydon, you\u2019d expect the LSE to clarify its thinking. Instead, the exchange issued a defensive statement that danced around the subject by asserting that \u201ca proper governance process\u201d was followed to orchestrate \u201can orderly succession\u201d. Sorry, but that doesn\u2019t answer TCI\u2019s point about why a succession was needed in the first place. The affair would evaporate in an instant if Rolet declared that, actually, he wants to leave. He could say, for example, that nine years is a long inninings for a chief executive and that he wishes to spend more time with his vineyard; or he could argue that turnover in the boardroom is healthy; or he could say that the collapse of the LSE\u2019s planned merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse earlier this year made next year a good time to go. But he hasn\u2019t made any of those points publicly \u2013 and nor has the company explained itself. TCI should keep pressing. It may turn out there is no mystery, but shareholders deserve better than the LSE\u2019s lofty obfuscation. Industrial strategy white paper needs to shed the woolly thinking Brexit, understandably, dominates conversation between government and business, and did so again at the CBI\u2019s conference on Monday. But let\u2019s not forget about that big initiative arriving soon \u2013 the government\u2019s all-singing industrial strategy, due to be unveiled alongside the budget later this month. If excitement about this supposedly pioneering adventure is less than fevered, that\u2019s because the government\u2019s green paper in January was so muddled. Are we heading down the US route, where government procurement favours the home team and universities and business are encouraged to form close ties? Or is the German approach \u2013 with its emphasis on research, development and training \u2013 deemed better? Or perhaps we\u2019re going French and signing up to big infrastructure projects. All three themes were present in January\u2019s document but they came across as series of good intentions, as opposed to an actual strategy that might survive a change of government. On that score, the CBI makes a good suggestion: create an independent Industrial Strategy Office modelled on the Office for Budget Responsibility to report and advise on progress. One advantage in this idea is that governments would be obliged to explain what they are hoping to achieve and what targets \u2013 on productivity, or whatever \u2013 they are willing to measured against. Some formal rigour might us also spare the tiresome spectacle of ministers reheating old announcements, or pulling in unrelated spending that would have happened anyway, and calling it an industrial strategy. There were too many of those tricks in the green paper. The business secretary, Greg Clark, let\u2019s hope, understands that a white paper that is equally woolly will be no use to anybody.",

      "body": "<p>Did the board of the London Stock Exchange demand that its chief executive quit against his wishes? This simple question, you would assume, could be answered with little fuss. All that is required is an answer from either the chairman, Donald Brydon, or the chief executive himself, Xavier Rolet.</p> <p>Yet, more than a fortnight after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/19/lses-french-boss-xavier-rolet-says-its-time-to-go-but-why\">the LSE announced that Rolet will leave at the end of next year</a>, nobody wants to speak clearly. The silence makes one think the Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI) is on to something. It is the hedge fund and long-standing LSE shareholder that claims that Rolet has been hustled unhappily towards the exit under the guise of \u201csuccession planning\u201d. It thinks a better plan would be to keep him.</p> <p>There was certainly a weird aspect to how the LSE announced Rolet\u2019s exit last month. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/19/lses-french-boss-xavier-rolet-says-its-time-to-go-but-why\">pointed out here at the time</a>, the group applauded the chief executive\u2019s \u201cremarkable achievements\u201d at length but didn\u2019t find space to address the central question: if he\u2019s so good, why\u2019s he going?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/03/arqiva-bakkavor-float-market-ipo\">UK firms pull multibillion-pound floats in latest sign of stock market jitters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a fair question. Rolet is only 57 and his nine years as boss are widely regarded as a huge success. The share price has improved from 500p to \u00a338 on his watch and the LSE these days is a broader-spread \u00a314bn operation.</p> <p>Now that TCI is threatening to call a meeting of shareholders to try to unseat Brydon, you\u2019d expect the LSE to clarify its thinking. Instead, the exchange issued a defensive statement that danced around the subject by asserting that \u201ca proper governance process\u201d was followed to orchestrate \u201can orderly succession\u201d. Sorry, but that doesn\u2019t answer TCI\u2019s point about why a succession was needed in the first place.</p> <p>The affair would evaporate in an instant if Rolet declared that, actually, he wants to leave. He could say, for example, that nine years is a long inninings for a chief executive and that he wishes to spend more time with his vineyard; or he could argue that turnover in the boardroom is healthy; or he could say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/29/london-stock-exchange-deutsche-borse-merger-blocked-ec\">the collapse of the LSE\u2019s planned merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a> earlier this year made next year a good time to go. But he hasn\u2019t made any of those points publicly \u2013 and nor has the company explained itself.</p> <p>TCI should keep pressing. It may turn out there is no mystery, but shareholders deserve better than the LSE\u2019s lofty obfuscation.</p> <h2>Industrial strategy white paper needs to shed the woolly thinking</h2> <p>Brexit, understandably, dominates conversation between government and business, and did so again at the CBI\u2019s conference on Monday. But let\u2019s not forget about that big initiative arriving soon \u2013 the government\u2019s all-singing industrial strategy, due to be unveiled alongside the budget later this month.</p> <p>If excitement about this supposedly pioneering adventure is less than fevered, that\u2019s because <a href=\"https://beisgovuk.citizenspace.com/strategy/industrial-strategy/supporting_documents/buildingourindustrialstrategygreenpaper.pdf\">the government\u2019s green paper</a> in January was so muddled.</p> <p>Are we heading down the US route, where government procurement favours the home team and universities and business are encouraged to form close ties? Or is the German approach \u2013 with its emphasis on research, development and training \u2013 deemed better? Or perhaps we\u2019re going French and signing up to big infrastructure projects.</p> <p>All three themes were present in January\u2019s document but they came across as series of good intentions, as opposed to an actual strategy that might survive a change of government. On that score, the CBI makes a good suggestion: create an independent Industrial Strategy Office modelled on the Office for Budget Responsibility to report and advise on progress.</p> <p>One advantage in this idea is that governments would be obliged to explain what they are hoping to achieve and what targets \u2013 on productivity, or whatever \u2013 they are willing to measured against. Some formal rigour might us also spare the tiresome spectacle of ministers reheating old announcements, or pulling in unrelated spending that would have happened anyway, and calling it an industrial strategy.</p> <p>There were too many of those tricks in the green paper. The business secretary, Greg Clark, let\u2019s hope, understands that a white paper that is equally woolly will be no use to anybody.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s hard-pressed retailers have urged the chancellor to deliver a budget for shoppers later this month after the latest snapshot of activity in the high street showed consumers under further pressure in October. The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like sales in October had fallen 1% compared with the same period last year. The key pre-Christmas trading period had started poorly for both stores and online traders, the BRC said, warning that the recent rise in interest rates from the Bank of England threatened to make consumers even more cautious. \u201cConsidering the intrinsic link between consumer spending and economic growth, the chancellor should reflect on this disappointing state of play and deliver a budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living. In other words, a shoppers\u2019 budget,\u201d said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson. The figures were released as car sales posted their seventh successive monthly decline, falling more than 12% in October against a backdrop of weak consumer and business confidence. The BRC-KPMG monthly retail sales monitor found that in-store sales of non-food items were down 2.1% on a year earlier \u2013 the sharpest rate of decline since BRC records began recording the category in January 2012. Annual growth in total non-food items \u2013 which includes internet shopping \u2013 stood at 0.2%, the lowest since the BRC started measuring the data in 2011, shortly after the economy began to recover from its deepest post-war recession. Although official retail sales figures do not always reflect survey evidence, the BRC-KPMG report adds to recent evidence that the squeeze on real incomes caused by higher inflation is making consumers unwilling to spend. The CBI reported last month that retail sales were dropping at their fastest pace since the economy was contracting sharply in the spring of 2009. Meanwhile, the credit card company Barclaycard said on Tuesday that consumer spending growth of 2.4% was running below the current 3% inflation rate as households cut back on \u201cnice-to-have\u201d goods and concentrated their limited budgets on essentials. Philip Hammond\u2019s scope for a giveaway budget on 22 November will be constrained by an expected cut to about 1.5% a year in the economy\u2019s potential growth rate by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Even so, retailers are pressing the chancellor for measures that would increase consumer demand or cut retailers\u2019 costs. Referring to a total October growth number of 0.2%, which includes stores open for less than year, the BRC\u2019s Dickinson said: \u201cIt was a meagre month in October for retail sales as shopping activity slumped. With total growth at its lowest since May and below the 12-month average, retailers will have cause for concern as they prepare for the crucial run up to Christmas.\u201d Dickinson added that consumers appeared to have spent their cash on outdoor experiences and excursions during half term rather than visit the shops. Over the three months to October, food sales increased 2.4% on a like-for-like basis but the BRC said spending figures in supermarkets had been boosted by price inflation. \u201cReal consumer spending power has been on a downward trend in the last year as the acceleration in inflation has caused shoppers to become ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cMany now face higher borrowing costs, given the rise in interest rates, which will only serve to heap further pressure onto household finances.\u201d Meanwhile, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the car market was on course for its first annual decline since 2001 and would continue to weaken in 2018 before stabilising in 2019, as sales for October declined by 12.2% year on year. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cDeclining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel. Consumers need urgent reassurance that the latest, low-emission diesel cars on sale will not face any bans, charges or other restrictions, anywhere in the UK.\u201d Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, said: \u201cWith the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision seeing the first hike in ten years, we are likely to see a continuation of the sector\u2019s slowdown, with consumers having less disposable income to spend. The autumn budget also nears closer and retailers will most likely be hoping for some form of relief, particularly after the challenges business rates created.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has followed the John Lewis festive playbook with a Paddington Bear-fronted Christmas campaign that embraces instore events, cuddly toys and a charity tie-in. \u201cPaddington and the Christmas Visitor\u201d will be linked to 90 products including a \u00a312 soft toy version of Paddington and a \u00a342 duffel coat. An expected \u00a3200,000 in profits from one of the items \u2013 a \u00a33 book \u2013 will go to the NSPCC to help fund its Childline service . M&amp;S will host children\u2019s book readings in store and encourage staff to carry out \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d such as free marmalade sandwiches in the cafe\u0301 . The tactics echo those of John Lewis, whose festive campaigns have become a media event envied by other retailers. John Lewis spends about \u00a36m on its annual campaign and has recently vied with Sainsbury\u2019s to be the most-watched Christmas ad. Last year\u2019s John Lewis advert, featuring Buster the boxer bouncing on a trampoline, attracted more than 20m YouTube views and helped to raise money for The Wildlife Trusts. John Lewis also sells millions of pounds worth of merchandise linked to its ads. In 2014, the department store group sold \u00a32.5m of goods linked to its Monty the Penguin ad, including 48,000 soft toys. The M&amp;S campaign will make its TV debut on Tuesday alongside the Pride of Britain awards on ITV. The ad will also be shown before cinema screenings of Paddington 2, which opens in British cinemas later this week. In the ad, Paddington stumbles upon a burglar, whom he mistakes for Father Christmas, and helps him deliver a bag of stolen presents back to where they belong. Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, director of marketing at M&amp;S, said: \u201c We wanted something which was fun, festive, entertaining, but family-centric. \u201d Paddington takes over from Mrs Claus, a character played by Janet McTeer, who fronted last year\u2019s adverts. In previous years, the high street chain has relied on celebrities including Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry to pull in shoppers. The change from the stylish Mrs Claus to a child-focused ad comes despite the success of last year\u2019s effort, which helped M&amp;S to report its first increase in Christmas clothing sales for six years.

The ad will also be shown before cinema screenings of Paddington 2, which opens in British cinemas later this week.</p> \n<p>In the ad, Paddington stumbles upon a burglar, whom he mistakes for Father Christmas, and helps him deliver a bag of stolen presents back to where they belong.</p> \n<p>Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, director of marketing at M&amp;S, said: \u201c We wanted something which was fun, festive, entertaining, but family-centric. \u201d</p> \n<p> Paddington takes over from Mrs Claus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/11/ms-marks-spencer-john-lewis-christmas-ad-mrs-claus\">a character played by Janet McTeer</a>, who fronted last year\u2019s adverts. In previous years, the high street chain has relied on celebrities including Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry to pull in shoppers.</p> \n<p>The change from the stylish Mrs Claus to a child-focused ad comes despite the success of last year\u2019s effort, which helped M&amp;S to report its first increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/08/good-christmas-marks-and-spencer-surprise-retailers-festive-sales\">Christmas clothing sales</a> for six years.</p> \n<p><em><sup>This article contains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">affiliate links</a> to products.
