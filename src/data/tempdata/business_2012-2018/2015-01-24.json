      "bodyText": "The head of Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 group has warned that bosses must take tackling inequality seriously, or run the risk that a widening gap between rich and poor will damage their companies. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the business community understood that it had a responsibility to help people to earn more. \u201cThere have been a lot of conversations here about inequality having reached a point where it is not acceptable from a moral point of view and that, in a commercial sense, it\u2019s bad for business,\u201d said Cridland. At the end of a week in which Oxfam released a report showing the richest 1% of people in the world were on course to own more wealth than the other 99%, Cridland said inequality was seen as \u201cone of the reasons why business does not have the standing it would like to have\u201d. Cridland said he had made a point in Davos of promoting the CBI report A better off Britain, which last November called on firms to do more to tackle inequality by providing childcare and boosting the skills of employees. \u201cPeople were genuinely surprised and impressed about what the CBI had to say.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, were among those in Davos raising the issue of worsening inequality. Cridland said that tackling inequality would benefit businesses in terms of both their reputation and their commercial prospects. \u201cI am not sure this would have been natural territory for us five years ago. \u201cI have been banging on for a year about higher earnings growth. I have been doing that in part because it is a sensible part of economic rebalancing to have sustainable consumption. It is important that low-paid workers are able to play their part as active consumers in our economy.\u201d Cridland said a third of those who were on the minimum wage when it was first established in 1999 were still on it, but added that there should also be a focus on those struggling on slightly higher incomes. He said high pay was a problem when it was not deserved, and drew a comparison with the wages earned by footballers. \u201cThe ordinary person struggling to buy a ticket for a football match thinks it is OK so long as the team is successful. If the team is not successful, they wonder why they are paying so much. There is less tolerance of business if people are not doing well.\u201d Last week\u2019s jobless figures showed unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in more than six years, but earnings growth is well below pre-recession levels. The CBI chief said: \u201cI am particularly interested in the escalator that takes people who are unemployed or low-paid on to better-paid work. Something has gone wrong with it. There are two or three missing steps in the middle.\u201d There was a tendency for semi-skilled posts to be filled by those who would once have been considered overqualified for them. \u201cHow does the barista become the skilled project leader or the sales team participant in a tech business, unless they are students in full-time employment, which some of them are?\u201d It was up to the state, Cridland said, to provide basic education, but it was for business to help people make progress in their careers: \u201cBusiness has to look at how it can help people up the escalator.\u201d",

So goodnight from Zurich airport (with its excellent Wi-Fi, pizza and weissbier), and thanks for your company this week. GW, JT and LE. This afternoon\u2019s session on the Global Financial Outlook failed the gender balance test, alas: Elsewhere in Davos....Sir John Sawers, chief of M16 until last year, has appeared on a panel at Davos to talk about the future of intelligence agencies. Jill Treanor writes: Sawers said the way technology companies reacted to the criticism which followed the Snowden leaks has led to reduction in corporation with the security services and added to the threat posed to society. He told the audience in Davos the securities agencies performed a \u201cpublic good\u201d and insisted that friend-on-friend collection of the kind exposed by Snowdon was a \u201cvery small proportion\u201d of the surveillance conducted by the agencies. He said there needed to be discussion about the supervision and oversight of agencies. He said the laws had been strengthened to give he parliamentary committee chaired by Sir Malcom Rifkind greater oversight, more power to two judges providing oversight. \u201cIt\u2019s like having an on-going judge-led inquiry into the work of the intelligence agencies,\u201d said Sawers. He said the reduced cooperation from technology companies in the wake of Snowden leaks meant \u201cintelligence collection was not as good as before\u201d. But he defended the need to collect data. \u201cOur lives would be much simpler if they used a simple system badguy.com\u201d. It was not just about collecting data,he said, as people still mattered, as did having a diverse workforce, They individuals involved, he said, were phenomenally brave and committed. It is not the first time he has spoken since leaving the agency. He told the FT last week that there should be restrictions on the availability of totally encrypted communications that are inaccessible to governments. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to have no-go areas for the police in our communities but [totally private means of communication] would be creating no-go areas for evil doers of any sort online \u2014 terrorists, criminals, paedophiles \u2014 to carry out their business,\u201d he said last week. The panel is wrapping up now. Nothing sensational, but I suspect Mark Carney\u2019s comments about QE fuelling risk-taking, inflation coming back to target, and cheap oil helping growth will all make some headlines. Or at least a few more tweets. The panel now moves onto technological issues, and the impact that innovation is having on the financial sector. Mark Carney says that we must avoid an Uber-style situation in the financial systems. Heads-up, UK readers. Mark Carney just told Davos two significant things about UK monetary policy and future interest rate rises. We currently have very low inflation in the UK (just 0.5%). We have the will and responsibility to look through this period of low inflation, and we will get inflation back to target in the forecast horizon. And secondly, Carney adds that \u201cIt is not lost on us that wages are picking up, as we forecast, in the most recent data\u201d. That adds up to a hint that UK interest rates may not stay at their current record low for as long as some in the markets now expect, I think. Kuroda says he\u2019s fully confident about the US economy, given how broad-based its growth is. We\u2019ve not heard much about the US yet, says moderator Larry Fink. That minor colony. We\u2019ll have it back, Mark Carney jokes. He seems in quite a good mood today...was in great form when we ran into him earlier today Mark Carney also cites the adjustment in the energy markets that we have all seen. He says: it is realistic to expect....that oil is lower for longer. Given where cash costs actually are across the globe and given where demand is likely to be. That creates an opportunity that is considerable and possible undervalued for the global economy. In Europe, there is a transition from everything being about monetary policy to everything being about stuctural policy. And in the UK, there is a transition from household spending driving growth to investment driving growth, he adds. Mark Carney says he is cautiously optimistic about global economic prospects this year - if the IMF is right that the world GDP will increase by 3.5%. He cites the prospect of a rise in US interests as a crucial factor (assuming it happens). As the BoE governor puts it: The increased diverge in monetary policy will lead to a benign increase in volatility and will test capital flows across the global economy, including to emerging economy.... And it will test the strength of the financial system. In a hundred years time, when we return to this podium, we probably will not remember this financial crisis, as it is just one among many, argues the IMF\u2019s Min Zhu. But this will remember that this is the year that emerging markets take half of the global GDP. Via Twitter, a quick summary of Mark Carney\u2019s comments (full details here) Kurodo also agrees that Japan needs to have its deficit in hand, given its huge national debt pile. Kuroda also insists that Japan is making pretty good progress in implementing Prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s third arrow, of structural reforms. He cites progress in getting more women into work, new laws to increase competitiveness are coming. We hope people are slightly more patient. We should not be patient, the IMF\u2019s Min Zhu shoots back, taking the opportunity to give Kuroda an economics lesson. Japan has received a big stimulus from the fall in oil prices, he points out: I think there is a good window for Japan to firmly implement structural reforms. I think the Japanese should not be that patient. And you are also also very sensitive to rises in borrowing costs, the IMF senior policymaker warns. Another reason to ast fast. That\u2019s quite a ticking off for Japan from Zhu. Larry Fink, the moderator, jokes that he hopes he\u2019s as strict with other countries too. Kuroda responds. Yes we shouldn\u2019t be too patient when pushing these structural reforms through. But the impact will take time.. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan says delegates have been too gloomy this year. He welcomes the ECB\u2019s new asset-purchase scheme, and also points to the drop in the oil price. Together they could \u201cgreatly improve global economic outlook\u201d Britain has been in a race against time to strengthen the economy before people become trapped in unemployment permanently, Mark Carney says. He says the job is going well, citing the jump in employment over the last couple of years. Isn\u2019t that the Chancellor\u2019s trumpet he\u2019s tooting? Mark Carney points out that monetary policy always has an impact on the way income is distributed. (In the case of QE, the ECB will be buying assets, pushing up their value and benefitting those who are already relatively wealthy). We will be tougher regulating banks in future, says Coeur\u00e9. And he cites the need to tackle unemployment, particularly among young people, in Europe. Next question to Mark Carney - will the ECB\u2019s new QE programme fuel financial instability? The Bank of England governor welcomes the ECB\u2019s move, but warns that it might cause more risk taking. We know that stimulus packages can lead to excessive risk-taking, Carney agrees. His concern is that people may make two false assumptions. 1) That there is a \u201ccentral bank put\u201d (which means that a central bank steps in to save the day when markets tumble; the original was the Alan Greenspan put). 2) That there is an illusion of liquidity in certain markets. We have seen sudden moves to illiquidity in some markets, even the US Treasury markets What\u2019s the solution? Steps have been taken, Carney continues. We have shored up the banks at the core of the financial system, with recapitalisation and stress tests. And Carney, as head of the Financial Stability Board as well as the Bank of England, he can get a mark-to-market view of the major banks each day. And we must reduce the amplification channels from the core of the system outwards. First question goes to the ECB\u2019s Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, just two days after the new Quantitative Easing programme was announced. Its been a pretty momentous week, Coeur\u00e9 smiles. It was clear that we had to do something about inflation. We learned from the QE packages in US, UK, Japan, but those experiences aren\u2019t really comparible as the ECB is setting monetary policy over 19 countries. And the ECB cannot do anything to raise Europe\u2019s growth rate in a lasting way, he warns. Only structural reforms and government action can do that. Lawrence Fink is introducing the panel, and reminding them that a year ago this panel didn\u2019t talk about ISIS, or Ukraine, or Oil. And the feeling of the panel was quite optimistic. I hope we\u2019ll do better this time, Fink adds. And we\u2019re off.. Bells are ringing across the conference hall - it\u2019s nearly time for the session on the Global Economic Outlook. On the panel....Bank of England governor Mark Carney, his Japanese counterpart Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF deputy managing director Min Zhu, the ECB\u2019s Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 and Brazil\u2019s finance minister Joaquim Levy. There\u2019s a live feed here: The Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans Pritchard has collared some of the experts on the Davos cybersecurity panel, and found little time for David Cameron\u2019s push to let security services access encrypted data. He writes: President Toomas Hendrik Ilves of Estonia, a cyber-expert whose country was subjected to a crippling attack for 24 hours in 2007, said Mr Cameron\u2019s plan is pointless unless it is part of a co-ordinated global push by all the main powers. \u201cIt is not going to make any difference if Britain does it alone,\u201d he told the Telegraph. And Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith also warned that encryption is too important to mess with: The path to Hell starts at the back-door. It compromises protection for everybody on everything. It\u2019s lunchtime at Davos, ahead of the big afternoon session on the state of the global economy. Mexico are sponsoring the event, so delegates are munching through black bean croquettes, pumpkin in sweet mole, octopus in veracruz sauce, duck breast, fish with roasted cauliflower, and a beef dish. Alas, no time to try the tequila.... There are still police officers manning the entrances of the World Economic Forum today: Some of the world\u2019s top scientists have been talking at Davos today, explaining their challenges and goals. Professor Mario Molina, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the damage that CFCs cause to the ozone layer, warned that scientists must do more to help the public understand the threat of climate change. Speaking to former US vice-president Al Gore, Molina warned that the environment is vulnerable, while the climate system is complex.. It doesn\u2019t take much to do a lot of damage. Molina also called on fellow scientists to speak out: \u201cWe in science are doing a lousy job in communicating the extent of the risks we are facing.\u201d Molina also called for a global solution to tackle global warming, which would force companies around the world to pay for their carbon emissions. Climate change has been a major theme at Davos, ahead of a major conference on Paris. Yesterday, French president Hollande urged businesses to help tackle the threat of climate change. He called for a \u201chuge investment\u201d in green tech to help tackle the biggest challenge of the 21st Century. But finding solutions for such huge problems take time. As Brian Schmidt, Professor, Australian National University, Australia, put it: Science is this great tool for predicting knowledge, but it\u2019s not guaranteed to come up with solutions fast enough. And science can suffer because research progresses at a slower pace than politics, warned Konstantin Novoselov, Research fellow at the Mesoscopic Physics Research Group at the University of Manchester: \u201cScientific research works on a longer cycle than the election cycle....We have to fight for the money from the people who don\u2019t get the benefits.\u201d Unilever chief executive Paul Polman is also banging the drum for gender equality today, alongside Melinda Gates. He\u2019s making some unarguable points, that companies simply have no excuse for not treating women completely fairly, especially if they want to perform well: The results are in..... Many delegates have been trotting around Davos with Fitbits on their wrist; they\u2019re from Swiss bank UBS, which promised to buy African schoolkids bicycles if delegates walked at least 6km on average. And our own Larry Elliott has racked up almost 27km since donning his. Enough for a bike, but not enough to come first : A total of 2,500 bicycles are now heading to Africa - so that\u2019s one good thing to come out of Davos. Back inside WEF, Melinda Gates is telling delegates that you could boost Africa\u2019s GDP by 12% by giving women \u201cparity of employment.\u201d And the key to improving gender equality in the developing world is to ensure that money passes to women. The research shows that they are much more likely to use every extra dollar to help their family, she explains. And she also flags up that progress is being made to cut infant mortality: Outside the conference hall, the task of packing up is beginning. Aberdeen Asset Management is clearing out of its prime spot on the Promenade. Locals may be relieved; Aberdeen have stationed a bagpiper outside the stand all week to serenade passer-bys. (see our Davos Diary for a Vine of him in action) Bobble-hat-tip to The Times\u2019s Business Editor, Richard Fletcher. Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves has defended telling his citizens to put sticky tape over the webcams on their computers to thwart hackers. Last April, Ilves claimed that surveillance was enabled in every computer and iPad unless you taped over the camera. He\u2019s unrepentant about recommending this DIY approach to cybersecurity, which he apparently follows too. He told the Davos panel on cybersecurity that: My domestic newspapers laughed at me and made me look like an idiot. I said \u201ctape over the camera\u201d....and they went  . And, yeah, well....  . Professor Jonathan Zittrain, moderating the session, is with President Ilves; I tape over my camera too, he says. Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith, and internet security guru Eugene Kaspersky, do not. We have special functionality to make sure the camera is turned off, Kaspersky declares, adding: I smile, I smile to the camera. The session is online here. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of the Estonia, is also speaking on the cybercrime panel at Davos. He urges users to upgrade old systems: If you\u2019ve still got Windows XP, you\u2019re in trouble....It\u2019s like Swiss cheese. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general council shoots back that XP is 14 years old, and no longer supported. Of course people should be upgrading. But a survey last year suggested there are still millions of machines running XP, despite Microsoft\u2019s attempts to lure them into buying a new operating system.... The recent Sony hack shows the perils of not setting up your security properly, Kaspersky adds. It seems that it was not a very sophisticated attack. The enterprise was protected, but it was not protected in the right way. But saying that, banks spend an awful lot of money on IT security and they are still occasionally the victim of very sophisticated hacks, he says. The game has changed. Fifteen years ago, cybercriminals were working alone, targeting individuals I said before there is criminal malware, and there is state-sponsored malware, and the difference is between a car and a space shuttle, reiterates Kaspersky, adding: And now, unfortunately, the evolution of cybercrime has come to a level where they are very professional. And they develop extremely complicated, highly professional attacks, and that makes my work more difficult. But how can a user actually be sure that a security product is only doing what it should? Eugene Kaspersky says that individuals can check their web traffic to see if anything unusual is happening. And he\u2019ll roll the red carpet out for government ministers: If you\u2019re a state you are welcome to come to our company and check the source code. Russian security expert Eugene Kaspersky is speaking on the cybercrime panel now. He cites Smart TVs are the next target for hackers. So are you keeping up, asks moderator Jonathan Zittrain. Unfortunately, my business is very good No, Zittrain says - I don\u2019t mean are you keeping up with orders. Are you actually covering the threats? Yes, I use my products on my computers, and I\u2019m completely connected. Kaspersky adds that \u201cyou need your brain turned on all the time when you\u2019re on the internet\u201d But what about governments? If I install Symantec antivirus on my machine, am I installing the US government with it, and if I pick a Russian product, am I installing Vladimir Putin with it? Kaspersky chuckles, then denies it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not, he says, adding that \u201cWe don\u2019t collect private information from the computers Davos would have been better this year if three people had joined the throng -- Thomas Piketty, Mario Draghi and Vladimir Putin. They\u2019re all had better things to do this week, which is a shame as collectively they have set the debate this year. So f you\u2019re reading, chaps, there\u2019s plenty of space this morning. It\u2019s been clear this week that some of our readers have a pretty mediocre view of Davos. The whole concept of powerful people gathering to \u201cimprove the state of the world\u201d, or fret about problems which are either beyond their control..or their fault, certainly grates with some. My colleague Larry Elliott has been coming to WEF since the 90s. He writes that one problem with Davos is that most people have a shared world view: There was nobody at this year\u2019s WEF, for example, arguing that Europe would be better off without the euro. Nobody gives it to the status quo with both barrels. Al Gore on climate change was as radical as it got. This groupthink is potentially dangerous but perhaps inevitable. For Davos man and woman, life is pretty sweet. Which is why there are some who say the true motto of the WEF should be: committed to improving the state of the world provided nothing much changes. Good morning from Davos. It\u2019s the fourth and final day of the World Economic Forum, the annual shindig of leaders, businesspeople, campaigners and economists. It\u2019s a quieter day, really. No big keynote speeches by world leaders are scheduled But we do have one setpiece event - a big session on the World Economic Outlook at 2pm CET, or 1pm GMT. On the panel, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, his Japanese counterpart Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF deputy managing director Min Zhu, the ECB\u2019s Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 and Brazil\u2019s finance minister Joaquim Levy. There are also various discussion groups and debates happening around the Davos conference centre, on issues such as cybercrime, science and inequality. We\u2019ll be covering the main events as we can, and also trying to work out what - if anything - Davos has achieved this year.",
