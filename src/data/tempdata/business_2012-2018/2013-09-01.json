      "bodyText": "George Osborne's much-vaunted \"march of the makers\" appears about to get under way more than two years after the chancellor coined the phrase. Manufacturers are ready to make huge investments in new technology and machinery after a rebound in output and orders in the last three months, according to a survey by the industry's trade body. The EEF found that investment intentions jumped to a six-year high in the last quarter as manufacturing businesses looked to benefit from an improving economy and greater stability in the eurozone. The engineering employers' group said all areas of manufacturing improved in the three months to the end of August, maintaining momentum from the spring. Output expanded at the fastest rate for three years as manufacturers added jobs and looked ahead to expanding orders at home and abroad. Lee Hopley, the EEF's chief economist, said a strong performance by the car and power-generation sectors was now married to strong growth by steelmakers and engineers. Domestic growth outstripped exports with a balance for domestic orders of +20% against +15% for exports. The chancellor suffered much jeering in the House of Commons in the months after his 2011 budget speech when he said manufacturing should lead the recovery and become the focus of new investment. Almost immediately a nascent boom in output was snuffed out and the sector became a drag on GDP growth. Since last summer the services sector has proved the only reliable source of growth with manufacturing appearing to recover, only to fall back again. But since the spring a sustained recovery appears to be under way. Hopley said: \"Industry's prospects have brightened considerably in the past few months and it's particularly positive that this improving trend can be seen across all manufacturing sectors. There is growing confidence that improving trading conditions will continue into the final months of this year and then accelerate through the gears in 2014.\" However, she warned that investment intentions needed to translate into action for the recovery to continue: \"While the signs of recovery that have emerged so far this year are positive, the need for better balanced growth from net trade and investment remains. As companies become more confident about their growth prospects, we need to see this translate into commitments to invest in new capacity, and for this to take place in the UK.\" The Bank of England's interest rate setting committee is due to meet this week and is expected to keep its stimulus of low interest rates and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing (QE) on hold on Thursday as it waits to see whether the recovery continues into the autumn. With all sectors of the economy moving ahead, the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC), headed by governor Mark Carney, is split between members who consider the economy can recover without further stimulus and a minority who believe continued weakness in the banking sector favours an expansion of QE. Analysts said the MPC is unlikely to act in its first meeting after having agreed to hold the stimulus package in place until unemployment falls to 7%, which the Bank does not expect until 2016. Hopley said a balance of 32% of companies reported increased output, up from 12% in the last quarter and the highest since the beginning of 2010.

    "webTitle": "Barbers and bookies fill gaps on high streets as independent shops shut", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's high streets are in the midst of a revolution as traditional independent shops are rapidly being replaced by service providers such as barbers, bookmakers, coffee shops and nailbars. Independent clothing stores, shoe shops and newsagents are shutting at a record rate with nearly 200 closing in the first half of this year, about the same number as in the whole of 2012, according to a report. But despite predictions of the death of the high street, the total number of independent outlets has crept up by 424 \u2013 or 0.4% \u2013 as entrepreneurs opened cafes, beauty salons, bookies, pawnbrokers and mobile phone outlets, said the British Independent Retailers Association and research firm the Local Data Company (LDC). \"This is fundamental structural change. No longer will shopping be the primary reason to visit a town centre. We are seeing the death of traditional shops and the rise of services which offer the personal touch, the things you can't buy at the supermarket or online,\" said Matthew Hopkinson, director of LDC. He said 8% of independent stores had either opened or closed in the last six months, a dramatic increase in the rate of \"churn\" from 1% in the first half of last year. The evidence of rapid change comes in a week when the future of the high street will be hotly debated. Mary Portas, the \"queen of shops\", will appear before a parliamentary committee on Monday to discuss progress since her review of the high street nearly two years ago, and on Wednesday the veteran retailer Bill Grimsey will outline a battery of tactics to help revive town centres. Grimsey, the former boss of Wickes and Iceland, has said nearly half the country's 44,000 retail businesses are \"zombie companies\" in the commercial equivalent of negative equity, with \u00a32.3bn of liabilities, and a quarter of those under threat can be expected to fail in the next three years. Amid estimates that 14% of shops in Britain stand empty, Grimsey will call on the government to give a 50% discount on business rates to retailers opening in premises that have been vacant for a year. He also wants the immediate introduction of a business rates revaluation due for 2015 and a freeze on rates from next year. He will suggest councils use their capital reserves to help fund small businesses. Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said independent stores were leading change in town centres as big chain stores pulled out. \"They are the best hope that our high streets have. But the margin between openings and closings, between vibrant health and sickness in the town centre environment, is just 0.4% in the first half of this year, far too fine a margin for comfort,\" said Weedon. Just a 10% decline in the number of independent stores would result in nearly 30,000 empty high street premises, double the current number. The report shows that independent stores are suffering more in some parts of the country than others. Surprisingly, given its resilience during the economic downturn, London and the south-east saw the greatest loss of independent stores while Wales saw the biggest rise, up 3.3% after a 3.3% drop in 2012. Weedon said: \"The Westminster government should take a look at the thoughtful work that the Welsh government has put into considering using business rate income for some good by supporting retailers opening in units that have been empty for over a year, while reining back on the massive rate discounts that have made the charity shop sector a leader in high street growth.\" He criticised plans for another rise in business rates next year which he said would add \u00a3200m or more to independent stores' costs after a \u00a3175m lift last April. The government is likely to come in for criticism this week as the high street continues to struggle amid worries that few of Portas' 28 recommendations have been put into action. When she appears before the communities and local government select committee, she will discuss the progress of the 27 \"Portas pilots\" schemes which each received \u00a3100,000 to fund new ideas to regenerate the high street. Another 326 town teams received \u00a310,000 each. While some projects have clearly brought results, others have been criticised for being slow to spend the cash and for wasting it on questionable initiatives, such as the \u00a31,600 Peppa Pig costume hired by Dartford council to appeal to families. In February, the first wave of 12 Portas pilot towns were revealed to have spent only 12% of the money handed to them and only two had managed to cut the number of empty shopping outlets. Amid concerns that the pilot towns were not getting enough support, the government set up the Future High Streets Forum, a group of retailers, academics and trade bodies, to help speed up the pace of response to the high street's problems. On Sunday Eric Pickles, the communities and local government minister announced teams of local experts would this month start training the leaders of the 326 Portas \"town teams\" in use of planning powers to reshape the high street to adapt to changing consumer behaviour. The government has also mooted changes to planning law to allow councils to convert empty shops into housing and cut business rates for some small businesses. Recently Pickles called on local councils to cut parking charges which he said \"undermine the viability of town centres\". Caffeine culture goes independent It calls for a celebratory full-roast choca mocha \u2013 in their fightback against chains such as Starbucks and Costa, independent coffee shops have become the fastest-growing small businesses on the high street. The number of boutique coffee shops in Britain's top 500 town centres grew by nearly 500% in the first half of this year compared with last year, according to the Local Data Company, as 60 new businesses sprang up fuelled by Britons' passion for caffeine. Matthew Hopkinson, director, of LDC, said: \"The pace of growth of independents is interesting in the light of the fact that coffee chains are also continuing to grow rapidly. It demonstrates there is a gap in the market for new and innovative ways of doing something that has been done before.\"With money tight for many during the economic downturn many independent retailers have suffered. But coffee shops are benefiting from their ability to offer a fairly cheap and cheerful treat backed by more personality, quirkiness and the loyalty built up through personal relationships between owner-managers and their customers. Tom Hiskey, who reviews independent cafes around the country for his Cosy Coffee blog, said better knowledge about coffee has also helped independent shops to thrive. \"Awareness of good coffee has shot up in the last few years. There was a massive concentration of new independent shops in London and people saw the benefits of being able to chat to the owners, and found it was cosier and more personal than going to Starbucks. Now there are similar places springing up around the country,\" he says. Gina Sleightholme, co-owner of Brew &amp; Brownie in York, which opened two months ago, said: \"We were inspired by the kind of places we liked going to in London when we went to visit friends and relatives there was nothing really like that in York. \"There are hundreds of traditional tea rooms for tourists but not something more attuned to younger people.\" She added that the cafe has been much busier than expected. Meanwhile, Dan Fellows, who has set up the first coffee shop for independent roasters Origin Coffee in Porthleven, Cornwall, said the tiny 10-seat establishment was benefiting from interest in its coffees from around the world and variety of brewing methods. \"We've had really good feedback and it has been busy and it gives us an opportunity to see how our ideas about brewing coffee work directly with customers,\" he said. Although specialist coffee bars are the fastest growing independent stores, Costa Coffee said in June it had opened 39 new shops in the UK in the first three months of the year and Starbucks has said it was committed to opening 300 UK shops by 2016. For those entrepreneurs whose businesses really take off, coffee shops also offer a potential route to riches by building small chains that can catch the eye of major investors \u2013 as with Tesco's investment in Harris + Hoole, a UK chain founded by Australian siblings Nick, Andrew and Laura Tolley. \"If you do get it right and expand like Harris + Hoole you can get on the radar of the Tescos of this world who want to buy into the excitement and loyalty of a new brand,\" said Hopkinson. But Harris + Hoole, which is now open in some branches of the UK's biggest supermarket, has attracted criticism from those who felt they were fooled into supping at what they believed to be an independent caf\u00e9, with different sensibilities to a large chain. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2013. An earlier version said a 1% decline in the number of independent stores would result in nearly 30,000 empty high street premises. The first figure has been corrected to 10%.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's high streets are in the midst of a revolution as traditional independent shops are rapidly being replaced by service providers such as barbers, bookmakers, coffee shops and nailbars.</p> <p>Independent clothing stores, shoe shops and newsagents are shutting at a record rate with nearly 200 closing in the first half of this year, about the same number as in the whole of 2012, according to a report.</p> <p>But despite predictions of the death of the high street, the total number of independent outlets has crept up by 424 \u2013 or 0.4% \u2013 as entrepreneurs opened cafes, beauty salons, bookies, pawnbrokers and mobile phone outlets, said the British Independent Retailers Association and research firm the Local Data Company (LDC).</p> <p>\"This is fundamental structural change. No longer will shopping be the primary reason to visit a town centre. We are seeing the death of traditional shops and the rise of services which offer the personal touch, the things you can't buy at the supermarket or online,\" said Matthew Hopkinson, director of LDC.</p> <p>He said 8% of independent stores had either opened or closed in the last six months, a dramatic increase in the rate of \"churn\" from 1% in the first half of last year.</p> <p>The evidence of rapid change comes in a week when the future of the high street will be hotly debated. Mary Portas, the \"queen of shops\", will appear before a parliamentary committee on Monday to discuss progress since her review of the high street nearly two years ago, and on Wednesday the veteran retailer Bill Grimsey will outline a battery of tactics to help revive town centres.</p> <p>Grimsey, the former boss of Wickes and Iceland, has said nearly half the country's 44,000 retail businesses are \"zombie companies\" in the commercial equivalent of negative equity, with \u00a32.3bn of liabilities, and a quarter of those under threat can be expected to fail in the next three years.</p> <p>Amid estimates that 14% of shops in Britain stand empty, Grimsey will call on the government to give a 50% discount on business rates to retailers opening in premises that have been vacant for a year. He also wants the immediate introduction of a business rates revaluation due for 2015 and a freeze on rates from next year. He will suggest councils use their capital reserves to help fund small businesses.</p> <p>Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said independent stores were leading change in town centres as big chain stores pulled out. \"They are the best hope that our high streets have. But the margin between openings and closings, between vibrant health and sickness in the town centre environment, is just 0.4% in the first half of this year, far too fine a margin for comfort,\" said Weedon.</p> <p>Just a 10% decline in the number of independent stores would result in nearly 30,000 empty high street premises, double the current number.</p> <p>The report shows that independent stores are suffering more in some parts of the country than others. Surprisingly, given its resilience during the economic downturn, London and the south-east saw the greatest loss of independent stores while Wales saw the biggest rise, up 3.3% after a 3.3% drop in 2012.</p> <p>Weedon said: \"The Westminster government should take a look at the thoughtful work that the Welsh government has put into considering using business rate income for some good by supporting retailers opening in units that have been empty for over a year, while reining back on the massive rate discounts that have made the charity shop sector a leader in high street growth.\"</p> <p>He criticised plans for another rise in business rates next year which he said would add \u00a3200m or more to independent stores' costs after a \u00a3175m lift last April.</p> <p>The government is likely to come in for criticism this week as the high street continues to struggle amid worries that few of Portas' 28 recommendations have been put into action.</p> <p>When she appears before the communities and local government select committee, she will discuss the progress of the 27 \"Portas pilots\" schemes which each received \u00a3100,000 to fund new ideas to regenerate the high street. Another 326 town teams received \u00a310,000 each.</p> <p>While some projects have clearly brought results, others have been criticised for being slow to spend the cash and for wasting it on questionable initiatives, such as the \u00a31,600 Peppa Pig costume hired by Dartford council to appeal to families.

      "bodyText": "September is a dangerous month. Five years ago this month, Lehman Brothers went belly-up. Twelve months earlier there was the run on Northern Rock. Black Wednesday in September 1992 saw Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism; the pound left the gold standard in September 1931. The signs are that September 2013 will also be an interesting month. That's interesting as in scary. There are five potential flashpoints: Syria, the G20 summit, emerging markets, the Federal Reserve meeting to discuss scaling down the US stimulus, and the German election. Any one of them has the potential to damage the global economy. Let's start with Syria. Military action by the west against the Assad regime could affect growth in two ways: directly, through higher oil prices, and indirectly, by depressing business and consumer confidence. On the face of it, there is no real reason why the air strikes favoured by Barack Obama should have led to the price of crude rocketing. Syria is not a major oil producer and there would only be an impact on oil supplies if Iran tried to close the Strait of Hormuz. This seems unlikely. But commodity markets quite often ignore economic fundamentals. There is already a Syria premium built into the price of Brent crude, which was changing hands at just under $120 a barrel in London last week. Any hint of the conflict spreading beyond Syria will see the cost of oil rise further, and while talk of $150 a barrel seems overly pessimistic there have been plenty of examples of rumour, fear and speculation combining to ramp up prices. Capital Economics estimates that $150 crude would knock a percentage point off global growth, turning a lacklustre performance into something close to stagnation. The impact on sentiment is impossible to gauge. There were no long-lasting effects on confidence from the much more extensive military action in Iraq a decade ago, but that was before the Great Recession of the past five years. Businesses looking for a fresh excuse to keep investment plans on hold may find that Syria provides it. That is more likely to be the case if the G20 summit in St Petersburg ends in acrimony. The conclave of developed and developing countries was supposed to usher in a new epoch of more co-operative global governance, and so it did \u2013 for the first 12 months after the G20's inaugural meeting in Washington in 2008. Since then it has been downhill all the way. G20 countries have failed to agree a joint line on economic stimulus versus austerity, and in the end member countries have simply done their own thing. But this time the summit could get really nasty if Vladimir Putin cuts up rough over US policy towards Syria, and gets backing from China. On past form, the chances of a big diplomatic bust-up are high, in which case expect markets to respond in their time-honoured fashion by seeking out safe havens in gold, the Swiss franc and the US dollar. This would exacerbate the problems of the more vulnerable emerging market economies, which have already seen sharp falls in their currencies against the dollar. India, which saw the rupee sink to a record low last week, and Indonesia, which raised interest rates to defend the rupiah, are the most exposed. Both India and Indonesia have deep-seated structural problems and these have been exposed by the Fed's announcement that it was contemplating scaling back \u2013 or tapering \u2013 its asset purchases under the quantitative easing programme. Money has flowed out of emerging markets and back into the US as a result, prompting fears of a rerun of the Asian currency crisis of 1997. These fears are almost certainly overblown. The trouble in the late 1990s was caused by countries with fixed exchange rate regimes trying to cope with vast hot money flows, which came flooding in and then flooded out again. The worst-affected nations had high levels of foreign currency debt and insufficient reserves with which to fight the speculators. None of that holds true today. There has been no repeat of the big capital flows seen in the 1990s, while floating exchange rates and substantial reserves mean emerging market economies are far better placed to defend themselves. Which is just as well, since collectively the emerging markets are far more important to the health of the global economy than they were in 1997. As Nick Parsons of National Australia Bank notes, 30 years ago the advanced world made up 70% of global GDP, with emerging markets the other 30%. Today the split is 50-50. As a result, he says, the Fed needs to be careful at its meeting on 18 September. \"US policymakers must increasingly be aware of their global responsibilities. The world economy, more than at any point in history, depends crucially on the success of the emerging market bloc and its fast-growing, populous nations. In 1998 the world economy withstood the Asian crisis. An emerging market crisis now \u2013 with policy stimulus in the developed world largely exhausted \u2013 would be a global, not merely a local concern.\" Of all September's potential pitfalls, policy error by the Fed is the one troubling markets the most. A year ago that would not have been the case, when pundits would have put the German election on 22 September at the top of their list of concerns. That is no longer the case as fears of a breakup of the euro have faded and Europe has emerged from an 18-month double-dip recession. But the eurozone's economic recovery is fragile and the need for a third bailout for Greece shows that the debt crisis is far from over. A tougher approach to indebted countries by the new government in Berlin would not be helpful. Action by the Fed is likely to be modest. The US central bank is not proposing to stop stimulating the economy, merely to trim the amount of support it provides. The likeliest outcome is that asset purchases will initially be tapered from $85bn a month to $75bn (\u00a355bn to \u00a348bn), the equivalent of a doctor slightly reducing the dosage of a powerful drug in the hope that eventually the patient can be weaned off the medication altogether. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, has adopted a reassuring bedside manner in his dealings with the stimulus junkies of Wall Street. He has talked through exactly what he plans to do and when he plans to do it. He has made it clear that he doesn't expect markets to stand on their feet overnight. Even so, there is still no certainty about the way things will pan out. Central banks have been using large doses of experimental drugs, and nobody knows for sure whether there will be hazardous side-effects. In a month's time we should have some sort of inkling of just how dangerous those side-effects might prove to be. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2013.

      "bodyText": "Back in the hazy, innocent days before the financial crisis, a small gathering of journalists was treated to an enthusiastic, chart-packed presentation about fund managers' next big money-making ideas. Most prominent among them was Turkey. Left out of Goldman Sachs's then premier league of Bric nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 Turkey was nevertheless poised to reap the benefits of its stable political situation, its ideal geographical position between Europe and Asia, and, in the analysts' view, its readiness for financial development. We were shown charts of the low percentages of Turkish consumers with mortgages, credit cards and washing machines \u2013 with the promise that as the economy became more financially advanced, they would soon catch on to the credit habit; and savvy investors should be poised to reap the rewards. As a cynical leftie hack, your correspondent's first thought was \"woe betide Turkey\". The memory came back last week, as the looming military strike on Syria, in Turkey's backyard, intensified a trend that was already well under way, with foreign investors who once saw the country as a dead cert running for the exits. The Turkish lira has fallen by more than 14% since the start of the year; the stock market is down more than 25%. Over much of the past decade, and particularly in the wake of the financial crisis, Turkey has ridden precisely the kind of boom the City investment gurus were betting on. Foreign capital flooded in. Turkish firms \u2013 including its banks \u2013 were flogged off to foreign buyers. Consumer credit exploded. It came to be seen as one of a batch of countries marching towards a bright financial future. Yet as in so many developing countries that become firm favourites with financial markets, the economic model that helped create the consumer boom of the past decade was always an intrinsically vulnerable one. As Ozlem Onaran of the University of Greenwich puts it: \"To benefit from capital inflows, there has to be a long-term perspective as to what to do with those capital flows.\" Even foreign direct investment, usually considered more serious and stable than flighty investment in shares, only boosts the economy if it provides positive spillovers in terms of job creation, skills and expertise. Onaran argues that if Turkey was going to make the most of its status as a market darling, it should have implemented a careful industrial strategy, to encourage investment into particular sectors and used taxes and tariffs to prevent unfettered inflows from inflating bubbles and pulling the economy out of shape. When hundreds of thousands of protestors packed Istanbul's Taksim Square to complain about the AKP government's autocratic rule earlier this year, the authorities began railing against the \"interest lobby\" \u2013 foreign speculators seeking to profit from Turkey's plight \u2013 and launched an inquiry. But they raised no such questions when the cash was flowing in. As the work of Elif Karacimen at Soas, University of London shows, the country's strong growth over the past decade was fed by a borrowing bubble, as the banking sector, under new, largely foreign ownership, turned away from the staid old model of making steady returns by funding the government's deficit towards more profitable lending on credit cards and mortgages. Ankara proudly managed to pay back the last of its debts to the International Monetary Fund earlier this year, with a $421m final instalment, after decades of bailout deals. But struggling free of its clutches was only a symbolic victory. While official loans have been paid back, private sector debt, owed by Turkish firms to foreign lenders \u2013 and, most alarmingly, often in foreign currencies \u2013 has shot up to unprecedented levels. That marks out Turkey as one of the countries particularly vulnerable to the Federal Reserve's plans to \"taper\" the flow of super-cheap money that has poured into emerging markets. In the short term, that will leave the authorities wrestling to manage a financial, and potentially even a political, crisis as the plunging currency makes foreign-denominated debts impossible to service. As the IMF put it recently: \"Turkey remains vulnerable to capital flow reversal due to its large external financing needs; should this occur, it could lead to a hard landing.\" But even if the worst outcome is averted, this latest spasm in emerging markets, with its echoes of the Asian crises of 1997-98, should force a rethink on a series of knotty issues. Developing-country governments should be encouraged to use capital controls, which remain anathema to neoliberal purists \u2013 though the IMF's position has softened somewhat \u2013 to protect themselves against the most damaging effects of sudden stop-start surges of short-term investment. And surely it must also be time for policymakers to heed the growing calls, from bodies such as Unctad, for a more concerted effort by developing nations to use every tool at the state's disposal to shape and develop the economy's productive potential, instead of heeding the siren calls of rapacious foreign speculators. That will mean developing an active industrial policy; but if growth is to be sustainable \u2013 and consumption-led, not fuelled by credit bubbles \u2013 it must also mean paying attention to the distribution of incomes. In Turkey, the AKP government has been kind to many of the poorest Turks and relative poverty has fallen; but middle-earners have seen their living standards stagnate while what Turkish economist Yilmaz Aky\u00fcz calls a select \"Islamic bourgeoisie\" thrives. He believes the country may be helped through the looming crisis by western allies keen to secure its assistance in the Syrian crisis, and holds out hope that once the worst is over, the plunging lira will help the country's competitiveness. But he acknowledges that the boom of recent years has only been achieved by selling off assets and running up debts, and that now, \"for Turkey, the honeymoon is over\".",
