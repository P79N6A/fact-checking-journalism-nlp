      "bodyText": "A former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland sent mocking emails as he attempted to manipulate the price of Libor, according to court filings in Singapore which add to the controversy surrounding the benchmark interest rate. Inspected by the Bloomberg news agency before they were sealed, the filings also show an RBS trader quipping \"hahahah\", describing Libor as a \"cartel\" and claiming that hedge funds would be \"kissing\" a colleague if the rate was reduced. The remarks are contained in instant messages, similar to emails, some of which were sent in the months before RBS was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds in October 2008. With reforms to Libor expected to be unveiled on Friday, the filings in the Singapore court show how traders around the globe appeared to find it easy to move the interest rate benchmark for at least four years.

      "bodyText": "The Treasury has seized on signs of life in the mortgage market as evidence that its radical funding for lending scheme (FLS) is working. The Bank of England's latest quarterly credit conditions survey, conducted in August and early September, showed a \"significant\" increase in the availability of secured lending, including mortgages. \"The Bank's figures today show that the number of mortgages out there for people looking to buy a home has increased significantly over the last three months, and that the Funding for Lending Scheme will help ensure that this continues in the coming months,\" said a Treasury spokesman. The balance of lenders reporting an increase in mortgage availability was the highest since the survey began in 2007. The rise was strongest among buyers with a deposit of less than 25% of the value of their home \u2013 those who have often struggled to borrow in recent months. However, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna pointed out that the bank said there was no evidence that more credit is flowing to businesses \u2014 the borrowers George Osborne is keenest to help. \"Firms across the country have been crying out for finance for many months and we hope the scheme does not go the way of ministers' Project Merlin and credit easing schemes, that failed to increase access to finance for businesses in the way hoped,\" he said. Malcolm Barr, UK economist at JP Morgan, said: \"The sharp move up in actual and expected mortgage availability will cheer the monetary policy committee, though [they] will wonder why the impact of the scheme should appear to be so asymmetric across sectors,\". September sales boost A separate survey released by the CBI shows that retailers saw a modest increase in sales in September after a dismal August when sales were affected by the Olympics, as consumers stayed at home to watch the Games. The CBI's latest distributive trades survey showed that 33% of retailers recorded rising sales rising in September, while 27% saw a fall. The positive balance of +6% was stronger than the -3% of August. The CBI added that retailers were also expecting stronger demand in the month ahead, boosting hopes that the economy could bounce back to growth in the third quarter of the year. Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Given the importance of consumer spending to the economy, this supports hopes that GDP growth in the third quarter will more than offset the 0.5% quarter-on-quarter contraction suffered in the second quarter when it was hit by special factors (the extra day public holiday and wet weather that hit construction and retail sales). \"The CBI survey also lifts hopes that the economy is seeing modest underlying growth.\" Chris Williamson, of the data provider Markit, said: \"Ongoing retail sales growth should help to drive economic growth and raises the likelihood that the UK has risen from its double-dip recession in the third quarter and, from a consumer angle at least, will start the fourth quarter on a reasonably sound footing.\" Official figures due to be released on Thursday are expected to show that the economy contracted less sharply in the second quarter of the year than the Office for National Statistics' previous 0.5% estimate. Analysts are also keenly awaiting the first signal of whether the economy expanded in the third quarter of the year, bringing the double-dip recession to an end. The first estimate of third-quarter GDP will be published late October.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Lloyd's of London insurance market has reported its strongest six month period for five years after a respite from claims for natural catastrophes that drove the market to a loss a year ago. The three centuries-old market, which insures a wide range of potential incidents through its syndicates, received claims as a result of the Costa Concordia cruise liner which capsized off the coast of Italy causing 32 fatalities. But none of the claims in the first half were on the scale of last year when claims of nearly \u00a37bn were made, caused by the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand as well as severe weather in the US. The value of claims fell to \u00a34.6bn while profits reached \u00a31.5bn, a dramatic improvement on the loss of \u00a3679m a year ago which it has described as the costliest six month period in its history. Richard Ward, chief executive of Lloyd's, was quick to contrast the market's fortunes with a year ago. \"The result has certainly been helped by the favourable claims climate. But it is testament to the market's disciplined underwriting that, in the face of continuing low premium rates, coupled with low interest rates and the most challenging economic climate for a generation, it is able to return the strongest half year result in five years.\" The weather over the next six months will have a significant impact on its full year figures and the market released its figures as the UK was hit by a storm that the Met Office described as the most intense to cross the country for over 30 years. Chairman John Nelson, a former investment banker who earlier this month called for sweeping changes to the culture of the financial services industry, warned that the market could not \"count on an extended period of low claims activity lasting until the end of 2012\". \"This is particularly the case whilst interest rates remain at historically low levels, meaning we cannot rely on investment income to make up for underwriting deficits,\" Nelson said. Investments made \u00a3619m, up from \u00a3548m, and better than expected because of the turmoil in the eurozone, which has driven down yields on government bonds in countries perceived to be relative \"safe havens\". Lloyd's has been preparing for the potential fallout from any disintegration from the eurozone and is working on the basis that it will have the same impact on its market as claims from a single hurricane, Ward said. The market has already reduced its exposure to the eurozone but finance director Luke Savage said there could still be claims. \"If there is a break-up one can only assume that there will be a proliferation of claims against banks for bad advice, as there was after the dotcom bubble, and the sub-prime situation in the US,\" Savage told Reuters. The impact of losses to crops caused by the drought in the US's so-called corn belt will not be fully known until the second half of the year, although the market's initial estimate was that it would be containable. The closely watched combined ratio \u2014 used to measure the profitability of its underwriting \u2014 was 88.7%, which demonstrates that the business was running at a profit compared with the reading of over 100% \u2014 which represents break even \u2014 a year ago. Earlier this month Nelson warned that bankers had \"believed their own spin\" in the run up to the banking crisis and \"the problem has been that they have recently been receiving the sort of financial rewards which rightly belong to the capital providers themselves\".",

But it is testament to the market's disciplined underwriting that, in the face of continuing low premium rates, coupled with low interest rates and the most challenging economic climate for a generation, it is able to return the strongest half year result in five years.\"</p> <p>The weather over the next six months will have a significant impact on its full year figures and the market released its figures as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/north-england-floods-homes\" title=\"\">UK was hit by a storm that the Met Office described as the most intense to cross the country for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>Chairman John Nelson, a former investment banker who earlier this month called for sweeping changes to the culture of the financial services industry, warned that the market could not \"count on an extended period of low claims activity lasting until the end of 2012\".</p> <p>\"This is particularly the case whilst interest rates remain at historically low levels, meaning we cannot rely on investment income to make up for underwriting deficits,\" Nelson said.</p> <p>Investments made \u00a3619m, up from \u00a3548m, and better than expected because of the turmoil in the eurozone, which has driven down yields on government bonds in countries perceived to be relative \"safe havens\".</p> <p>Lloyd's has been preparing for the potential fallout from any disintegration from the eurozone and is working on the basis that it will have the same impact on its market as claims from a single hurricane, Ward said.</p> <p>The market has already reduced its exposure to the eurozone but finance director Luke Savage said there could still be claims.</p> <p>\"If there is a break-up one can only assume that there will be a proliferation of claims against banks for bad advice, as there was after the dotcom bubble, and the sub-prime situation in the US,\" Savage told Reuters.</p> <p>The impact of losses to crops caused by the drought in the US's so-called corn belt will not be fully known until the second half of the year, although the market's initial estimate was that it would be containable.</p> <p>The closely watched combined ratio \u2014 used to measure the profitability of its underwriting \u2014 was 88.7%, which demonstrates that the business was running at a profit compared with the reading of over 100% \u2014 which represents break even \u2014 a year ago.</p> <p>Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/sep/06/banks-change-lloyds-london-tell-them-so\" title=\"\">Nelson warned</a> that bankers had \"believed their own spin\" in the run up to the banking crisis and \"the problem has been that they have recently been receiving the sort of financial rewards which rightly belong to the capital providers themselves\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Russian partners inside the TNK-BP joint venture are talking to financiers about raising money to make a potential $20bn (\u00a312.4bn) cash offer for BP's stake in the oil and gas business as early as next month. The revelations have been met with a steely silence from BP which has developed a profound scepticism about the Moscow-based oligarchs who are still suing the British company in a Siberian court. The Russian partners who control the Alpha Access Renova (AAR) consortium had previously been offering to purchase half of BP's 50% stake in TNK-BP \u2013 but rival interest from state-owned Rosneft has forced it to think again. \"They [AAR] have decided they will make a cash offer for the full BP stake and are beginning to talk to banks,\" said sources close to the Moscow-based consortium. Asked why they had changed their minds, the source said: \"Clearly circumstances have changed and we are dealing with a bidding situation with Rosneft offering cash and shares and BP making clear it is not interested in selling only half of its stake.\" The BP share in TNK-BP is generally thought to be worth $20bn-$25bn but AAR shareholders Mikhail Fridman, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik, have apparently not yet decided exactly how much they will offer. AAR had previously said it was willing to pay $10bn for a 25% stake in TNK-BP, Russia's third-largest oil company. BP, which needs cash to help pay for potential liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, has already talked to Rosneft and Vladimir Putin about a cash and share swap worth $20bn. BP, which has had a turbulent relationship with AAR, may see benefits from retaining a stronger foothold in Russia through a tie-up with Rosneft even in the face of a full cash offer from the oligarchs. The company declined to comment but outside industry sources said BP senior officials were wary that any offer from AAR was likely to come with strings attached. The previous offer of $10bn from AAR was conditional on $3bn being subtracted to take account of the court case in Omsk being dropped by AAR. Claims were made against BP in West Siberia on the grounds that the British company's now-failed attempt to set up a rival joint venture with Rosneft had damaged the TNK-BP share price. Under the TNK-BP shareholder agreement, only AAR could have an offer accepted before a 90-day deadline from the date when BP announced it wanted to sell its stake elapsed on 17 October. Other bidders may then step in with formal offers, creating the prospect of a bidding contest. Bankers have told Reuters that it would be possible for AAR to finance a significant portion of any purchase by leveraging up TNK-BP, which has paid out $19bn in dividends since BP came into the venture in 2003. But other commentators are sceptical and argue that Kremlin politics could be the deciding factor in any asset sale. There has also been suspicions that Fridman and the other oligarchs would ultimately like to sell their 50% stake in TNK-BP also and have hinted it would see Rosneft as the ultimate buyer. Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft and traditionally close to Putin, was quoted by Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, last week as saying his company would \"consider\" any offer of sale by AAR. TNK-BP posted a record $14.6bn in profits last year and its gross debt was $8bn at the end of 2011, all of it unsecured and most of it long-term. That indicates, some bankers say, TNK-BP's ability to sustain a higher debt burden to finance a possible buyout by AAR.

      "bodyText": "A Federal Reserve official's scepticism about the US central bank's efforts to stem the financial crisis alarmed Wall Street on Tuesday, as the International Monetary Fund warned that the global financial system remains as risky as it was before the credit crisis. US investors recorded their biggest sell-off in three months after Charles Prosser, hawkish president of the Fed's Philadelphia branch, said the bank's revival strategy, including $40bn a month of mortgage bond purchases, were unlikely to do much for economic growth or unemployment. In its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, published on Tuesday, the IMF argues that despite a blizzard of new regulations the banking system is still vulnerable. \"Although the intentions of policy makers are clear and positive, the reforms have yet to effect a safer set of financial structures, in part because, in some economies and regions, the intervention measures needed to deal with the prolonged crisis are delaying a 'reboot' of the system on to a safer path,\" the document says. The IMF was one of the global institutions blamed after the \"great crash\" of 2008-09 for exaggerating the benefits of financial globalisation and failing to issue strong enough warnings about the risks. In its latest analysis the group finds that the world's banks are just as big and intertwined and just as reliant on short-term wholesale funding (rather than more solid savers' deposits) as they were prior to the financial crash. \"Although some countries, notably the US, have reduced their dependence on short-term funding, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the structure of the system has not changed in healthier directions,\" it reports. The IMF points out that in many countries, including the UK, troubled banks were swallowed up by stronger rivals at the height of the crisis, leaving the financial sector even more concentrated than it was before 2008. \"Overall, risks in the financial system remain.

The potential future use of structured and some new derivative products could add to complexity and a mispricing of risk.\" With leading economies, including those of the US, UK and eurozone, struggling to generate sustainable economic growth, the IMF is also concerned about potential side-effects of the low interest rates and other radical monetary policies central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are using to stave off a deeper downturn. \"If the central bank initiatives are not accompanied by resolute actions to thoroughly restructure the impaired segments of the financial system and solve deep-seated remaining problems in financial institutions they may inhibit adjustments in the structure of banking systems,\" the IMF says.
