It follows a trend that started with Labour\u2019s Better Regulation Taskforce and has seen successive Tory governments progressively wash their hands of inspection services via privatisation and deregulation. Many poultry factories already have industry-paid inspections rather than government-employed meat hygiene service inspections. The lessons have not been learned. It was the total failure of the industry setting its own standards and regulating itself that led to last year\u2019s chicken bug scandal when the Food Standards Agency watchdog found nearly eight out of 10 fresh chickens bought from UK supermarkets were contaminated with the potentially lethal food-poisoning bug campylobacter, costing the NHS nearly \u00a3900m. Not one individual poultry or supermarket chain was found to be meeting national targets; more than 240,000 people a year were being made ill and up to 100 people were dying. Yet only when the agency started to name and shame individual companies did the industry act. Even then it reluctantly claimed that it was difficult to control disease in birds. History shows that health and welfare problems in the food industry start when governments encourage companies to police themselves. Salmonella in eggs, BSE in cattle, foot and mouth and swine flu all followed cuts in animal welfare standards or inspection services. They became national scandals in the 1980s and 1990s, and a generation of children were put off eating meat, disgusted at at the treatment of animals and the potential danger. That British distaste for animal cruelty led governments to progressively raise welfare standards that are now higher in the UK than in much of the rest of the EU. But the few giant poultry groups that dominate an industry that provides nearly 50% of all the meat we eat have always complained that this puts them at a competitive disadvantage. Never mind there is a strong demand for quality meat in Britain and little evidence that the industry is losing money directly from cheap imports, they hope by lowering standards to be able to sell more in Europe. But the move by the environment secretary, Liz Truss, lets us see what will surely happen if the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), now being negotiated, is allowed to drive more deregulation and further water down food and farming standards. If the EU and the US reach agreement, we are likely to see giant US agribusiness exporting products to Europe of a much lower standard in terms of hygiene and welfare. Should Britain exit the EU, we can now see clearly that lower welfare standards will become standard here, too.",

    "webTitle": "BHS pension: why the regulator wants Sir Philip Green to contribute more", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Sir Philip Green negotiates over a multimillion-pound payment into the troubled BHS pension scheme, regulators will be casting an eye over the \u00a3580m extracted by Green\u2019s family and other shareholders from the ailing retailer over the past 16 years. BHS has been given six months to reach a deal over the funding of the scheme and the pensions regulator wants Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 a year ago, to provide a large cash injection. Green is understood to have offered \u00a340m in cash to help support the fund \u2013 which has 20,000 members - and to write off a \u00a340m charge held by his Arcadia Group over BHS assets. But the regulator wants more and its bid for further support is likely to be strengthened by a Guardian analysis which suggests the amount Green\u2019s family earned from BHS is more than the retailer\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit, as measured on a buyout valuation. When Green bought BHS in May 2000, the group\u2019s fund was in surplus. In the year to March 2001, accounts for BHS Group filed at Companies House indicate a surplus of at least \u00a35m and a year later that had risen to \u00a312.2m. But when pension trustees wrote to members in December last year, they warned that the company\u2019s two funds had a combined deficit of \u00a3225.6m. After buying the business in May 2000, shareholders extracted just over \u00a3422m in dividends between 2002 and 2004 \u2013 the vast majority of which went to Green\u2019s family. A company controlled by Green also earned nearly \u00a310m in interest payments from a \u00a319.5m subordinated bond issued to BHS in May 2000. The Green family also collected \u00a3151.4m in rent from 12 stores owned by its Carmen Properties entity. The stores were bought for \u00a3106m in 2001 and sold last year as part of the deal under which the business passed to Retail Acquisitions. The Green family sold the Carmen properties to Retail Acquisitions for \u00a370m as part of the takeover deal, and the billionaire has pointed out that that marks a near \u00a340m loss \u2013 although it was more than offset by the rental income. Another entity under the Green family\u2019s control, Mildenhall, collected nearly \u00a33m from ground rent on one of BHS\u2019s head offices over seven years. Green\u2019s Arcadia Group also wrote off \u00a3200m of a charge over BHS assets as part of the takeover deal with Retail Acquisitions. Arcadia retained a further \u00a340m of inter-company debt which is likely to be written off. It also left \u00a365m of cash in the business as well as about \u00a3100m of freehold and long leaseholds. Arcadia also agreed to pay \u00a35m a year into the pension fund over three years, alongside a matching \u00a35m payment from Retail Acquisitions. BHS\u2019s pension fund appeared well supported until 2008, the year of the financial crash. That year, the scheme had a surplus of \u00a33.4m. But as BHS was absorbed into Green\u2019s Arcadia Group and the outlook for pension fund holdings of equity investments deteriorated, the deficit soared. By 2009 it stood at \u00a3137.9m. In that year BHS agreed to inject additional contributions of \u00a32.5m, rising to \u00a37.3m in 2012, when trustees set out a 23-year recovery plan for the deficit. Pension expert John Ralfe said many pension funds had suffered over that period but he believes the BHS fund made mistakes: \u201cThey chose to bet on equities, rather than matching long-dated bonds. But in 2012 they set out a recovery plan of 23 years, which is far too long. The company should have been putting more money in, more quickly.\u201d Pensions experts said 15 years was generally considered a long period for a recovery plan. A spokesperson for BHS\u2019s former owners said: \u201cThere was an independent board of trustees who had sole control of the pension funds and they made the decisions. If a deal was agreed of \u00a3x to be paid that was the deal. They were free to do whatever they liked.\u201d Chris Martin, the chairman of BHS\u2019s pension fund trustees, was not in post at the time the recovery plan was agreed, but said he understood BHS was not in a financial position to pay more. \u201cI\u2019m aware that the company was cash constrained,\u201d he said. \u201cThe duration of the recovery plan was balanced against the level of investment risk to reach a period suitable for the circumstances of the scheme.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Pension Protection Fund may take stake of at least 33% in BHS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The state-backed Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is poised to take a stake of at least 33% in BHS as the struggling department store chain faces a complex battle to restructure its retirement scheme and secure its survival. The retailer\u2019s future effectively lies in the hands of pension regulators and its former owner, Sir Philip Green, who could provide funds to fill the pension deficit of \u00a3571m. BHS faces months of wrangling over the deficit, despite creditors voting through a vital company voluntary arrangement (CVA) this week. In return for the BHS pension scheme entering the state-backed lifeboat, the PPF will take a stake of at least 33% and wants cash to be contributed towards the deficit. The PPF was created under the 2004 Pensions Act to provide protection if funds become insolvent and is paid for from a levy on employers. It has warned BHS that it could push the company into administration if it does not stump up support for its pension scheme by the end of September. A source close to the PPF said it was prepared to take that step: \u201cIf the circumstances are right, then yes they will do it. We now have a window of opportunity. Hopefully it will be used wisely.\u201d The PPF can crystallise the pension deficit, creating \u201csection 75 debts\u201d that BHS would be obliged to pay. However, the PPF is likely to accept a compromise deal \u2013 whereby BHS or a third party stumps up cash to fill some of the deficit. Given the strain on BHS, which has been loss-making for several years, it is unlikely to be able to meet this demand. However, Green and his family, the retailer\u2019s former owners, could provide the funds. The pensions regulator is understood to be exploring whether Taveta, the investment firm held by Lady Tina Green, Green\u2019s wife, should be forced to put cash into the pension scheme. Green is reported to have offered \u00a380m, \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m as a loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets. The pensions consultant John Ralfe said: \u201cIt looks like Taveta, the former owners, now has a six-month window to offer a large chunk of money to plug the BHS pension deficit. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t happen it seems inevitable that BHS will fall into administration and the pensions regulator will start the process of making a legal claim through the courts.\u201d The agreement that involves the PPF taking control of a pension scheme from an employer is known as a regulated apportionment arrangement. It must be approved by the regulator as well as the PPF. The BHS pension scheme has already entered an assessment scheme with the PPF, which could last up to two years. It will be one of the largest pension schemes in Britain to ever enter the protection fund. The situation is complex because typically the PPF would be dealing with a company that has gone bust, rather than one that is still trading. A spokesperson from the regulator said: \u201cWhere an employer which sponsors a pension scheme is subject to a qualifying insolvency event, we may be involved in discussions with the parties involved. However, we will only comment on individual schemes and/or companies if and when it is appropriate to do so. \u201cWe are able to confirm that we are aware of the situation but have no further comment to make at this time.\u201d Whatever the outcome, pensions for the 20,000 members of the BHS scheme will be protected. Under the PPF, however, benefits would be cut by 10% for most existing staff, with senior management enduring a larger reduction. BHS considered creating a new pension scheme as an alternative to entering the PPF last year, according to sources. This scheme would have offered smaller cuts to pensions than entering the PPF but still saved the company money compared with the existing scheme. The proposal was drawn up under a programme dubbed internally as Project Vera, which examined options for the scheme. However, the likelihood of this proposal getting passed by the regulator was slim. BHS is thought to have shelved the idea and is focused on entering the PPF. The retailer won a stay of execution this week when creditors approved its survival plan, a CVA securing the short-term future of BHS\u2019s 10,000 staff. The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. Up to 40 of these could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners. BHS also needs to raise \u00a3100m to fund its operations and a turnaround plan. It is close to agreeing a \u00a360m loan with Gordon Brothers, the restructuring firm, and raising another \u00a330m though subletting part of its flagship shop on Oxford Street in London. BHS is owned by Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants who bought the business from Green for \u00a31 last year. New documents filed at Companies House reveal that 90% of Retail Acquisitions is owned by Dominic Chappell, a two-time bankrupt. Another 5% is owned by Eddie Parladorio, a lawyer, with 2.5% held by Stephen Bourne, an accountant, and another 2.5% held by lawyer Mark Tasker.",

BHS faces months of wrangling over the deficit, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/bhs-creditors-approve-rescue-plan-company-voluntary-arrangement\">creditors voting through a vital company voluntary arrangement</a> (CVA) this week.</p> <p>In return for the BHS pension scheme entering the state-backed lifeboat, the PPF will take a stake of at least 33% and wants cash to be contributed towards the deficit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/25/bhs-pension-regulator-sir-philip-green-analysis\">BHS pension: why the regulator wants Sir Philip Green to contribute more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The PPF was created under the 2004 Pensions Act to provide protection if funds become insolvent and is paid for from a levy on employers. It has warned BHS that it could push the company into administration if it does not stump up support for its pension scheme by the end of September.</p> <p>A source close to the PPF said it was prepared to take that step: \u201cIf the circumstances are right, then yes they will do it. We now have a window of opportunity. Hopefully it will be used wisely.\u201d</p> <p>The PPF can crystallise the pension deficit, creating \u201csection 75 debts\u201d that BHS would be obliged to pay. However, the PPF is likely to accept a compromise deal \u2013 whereby BHS or a third party stumps up cash to fill some of the deficit.</p> <p>Given the strain on BHS, which has been loss-making for several years, it is unlikely to be able to meet this demand. However, Green and his family, the retailer\u2019s former owners, could provide the funds.</p> <p>The pensions regulator is understood to be exploring whether Taveta, the investment firm held by Lady Tina Green, Green\u2019s wife, should be forced to put cash into the pension scheme. Green is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/13/sir-philip-green-bhs-pension-scheme\">reported to have offered \u00a380m</a>, \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m as a loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets.</p> <p>The pensions consultant John Ralfe said: \u201cIt looks like Taveta, the former owners, now has a six-month window to offer a large chunk of money to plug the BHS pension deficit.</p> <p>\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t happen it seems inevitable that BHS will fall into administration and the pensions regulator will start the process of making a legal claim through the courts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3016aa12397b4f098c1b22a23136e51f2455e99e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3016aa12397b4f098c1b22a23136e51f2455e99e/241_197_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of BHS, is reported to have offered \u00a380m to help plug the retailer\u2019s pension deficit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The agreement that involves the PPF taking control of a pension scheme from an employer is known as a regulated apportionment arrangement. It must be approved by the regulator as well as the PPF.</p> <p>The BHS pension scheme has already entered an assessment scheme with the PPF, which could last up to two years. It will be one of the largest pension schemes in Britain to ever enter the protection fund.</p> <p>The situation is complex because typically the PPF would be dealing with a company that has gone bust, rather than one that is still trading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/bhs-creditors-approve-rescue-plan-company-voluntary-arrangement\">BHS chief asks public for second chance as retailer wins crucial vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson from the regulator said: \u201cWhere an employer which sponsors a pension scheme is subject to a qualifying insolvency event, we may be involved in discussions with the parties involved. However, we will only comment on individual schemes and/or companies if and when it is appropriate to do so.</p> <p>\u201cWe are able to confirm that we are aware of the situation but have no further comment to make at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, pensions for the 20,000 members of the BHS scheme will be protected. Under the PPF, however, benefits would be cut by 10% for most existing staff, with senior management enduring a larger reduction.</p> <p>BHS considered creating a new pension scheme as an alternative to entering the PPF last year, according to sources. This scheme would have offered smaller cuts to pensions than entering the PPF but still saved the company money compared with the existing scheme. The proposal was drawn up under a programme dubbed internally as Project Vera, which examined options for the scheme.</p> <p>However, the likelihood of this proposal getting passed by the regulator was slim.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a shortage that could leave a bad taste in the mouth this summer, as food manufacturers grapple with rocketing vanilla prices that threaten to push up the cost of ice-cream. The price of Madagascan vanilla surged by nearly 150% last year after the island, the dominant producer, experienced a poor harvest. Now food industry executives are reporting a fresh rise in prices as supply tightens. Charlie Thuillier, the founder and managing director of the ice-cream brand Oppo, said the cost of the vanilla extract his company buys has spiked. \u201cThe price has doubled in the last month. We were paying \u20ac35 a litre in February but now it\u2019s \u20ac76,\u201d he said. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world, after saffron, a result of its long and labour-intensive cultivation. Part of the orchid family, vanilla beans are hand-pollinated on family farms. Each flower opens for only one part of one day during the season \u2013 if it is not pollinated on that day, no pod is produced. Once picked, the curing process, which involves drying the beans in the sun by day and allowing them to sweat in a box at night, takes three to six months. Silver Spoon, which distributes the American Nielsen-Massey vanilla brand in the UK, said: \u201cThe market price of vanilla has risen over the past 12 months, and sharply over the last 12 weeks. This has been driven largely by a poor quality harvest in Madagascar. Our hope is that vanilla prices will return to a more stable level in the future.\u201d The main producers of food grade vanilla \u2013 known as black vanilla because of the colour of the dried pods \u2013 are Madagascar, followed by Mexico and Tahiti. As with wine, chocolate and coffee, the vanilla from each country has its own distinctive characteristics but it is Madagascan vanilla that produces the creamy, sweet flavour beloved of Britons. The data company Mintec says Madagascan vanilla bean was changing hands for \u00a3144 a kilogram in January compared with \u00a359 at the start of 2015. \u201cVanilla prices started rising in 2012-13 due to quality concerns and have continued to rise,\u201d said its analyst Jara Zicha. There are three main commercial preparations of whole beans, powder, and extract. Extract, made by steeping the ingredient in alcohol, is sold by the \u201cfold\u201d \u2013 a unit that denotes the weight of vanilla beans per gallon. Soaring prices will hurt companies that use the ingredient in everything from soft drinks to cakes and perfume. But the pain will be felt most acutely by ice-cream makers, as it is the most expensive ingredient in the production process and some will be forced to pass on the increased cost to consumers. Oppo, which counts the tennis player Andy Murray among its investors, buys extract to flavour its \u201cMadagascan vanilla with a hint of baobab\u201d ice-cream. \u201cYou can get vanilla extract all over the world but we chose Madagascar because it had the greatest depth of flavour,\u201d says Thuillier. \u201cManaging the price increase is a bit of a challenge for us but we haven\u2019t changed supplier. If you are doing battle with giants like Unilever you need a product that\u2019s unbelievable. We will sell more.\u201d When prices are high, market experts say, farmers are tempted to pick beans early. That leads to a less intense flavour, compounding problems in the market. The high-value crop is also a target for criminals. \u201cThere are reports that vanilla farmers in Madagascar harvested their 2015 crop prematurely, in fear of losing their production to thieves,\u201d said Zicha. \u201cThis, coupled with inadequate drying in order to increase profits from their crop has led to lower quality vanilla.\u201d A decent vanilla bean crop in Madagascar is judged to be about 2,000 tonnes, whereas in 2015 it was between 1,300 and 1,400 tonnes. This summer\u2019s harvest will be ready for shipment from November and some industry figures anticipate it will be more bountiful. Craig Nielsen, the chief executive officer of Nielsen-Massey Vanillas, told Food Business News magazine: \u201cThe flowering for [the 2016 crop] was good, and prices may start to drop in the fourth quarter.\u201d The combination of high prices and poor quality means some manufacturers are turning to synthetic alternatives. But many food brands are not open to using artificial flavourings. Dave Bishop, the production manager at New Forest Ice Cream, said its vanilla costs have risen by 18.5%. But, he said, there is no option but to pay up: \u201cVanilla is every ice-cream company\u2019s biggest-selling product. You can bring out a niche flavour but vanilla will still be top. You\u2019ve just got to take the hit on it because customers would notice the difference.\u201d",
