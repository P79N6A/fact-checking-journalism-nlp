    "webTitle": "Spain on collision course with Brussels over budget deficit targets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spain is on a collision course with the European commission after Brussels fired a warning shot at the austerity wracked country for planning to overshoot its budget deficit targets. In an early test for the EU's new fiscal regime, the commission said Madrid was engaged \"in a serious deviation\" from previous pledges after Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new conservative prime minister, confirmed the government would fail to meet a budget deficit target this year of 4.4% of gross domestic product agreed earlier with Brussels. Rajoy has set a new target of 5.8% for this year after revealing that last year's deficit was 8.5%. The stand-off between the European authorities and Spain, a vulnerable party in the eurozone's debt crisis, came as Greece raced against the clock to sign up willing creditors for writing down half of its debt to private lenders. Athens has until Thursday evening to conclude a debt swap with its private creditors, reducing its obligations by \u20ac100bn as a central element in its new \u20ac130bn bailout accord with the eurozone. It remained unclear on Monday night whether some 90% of Greece's private creditors would volunteer for the deal by Thursday, casting uncertainty over the prospects for the bailout. But the International Institute of Finance, representing around half of the creditors, said its members would accept the terms, while Athens threatened to invoke legal clauses to force others to follow suit. \"Our target is near universal participation,\" Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, said. \"Whoever thinks that they will hold out and be paid in full is mistaken,\" he told Reuters. With the fate of the Greek bailout hanging in the balance, but likely to go ahead, eurozone finance ministers are to hold talks on Friday once they have learned the participation rate in the \"haircuts\" being suffered by Greece's private creditors. While Greece's position should be clarified this week, other challenges to the EU's fiscal dilemmas are bubbling away, ready to erupt. In recession, wrestling with runaway unemployment rates that are the highest in Europe, and already embarked on huge spending cuts, the Spanish government appears to be up against a European commission keen to make full use of its new powers. The commission has already ordered Belgium to slash its spending and threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of euros in funds to Hungary unless Budapest sticks to its budgetary pledges, making it more difficult to show leniency towards Madrid. The Netherlands is also heading for a confrontation after its finance ministry warned that deficit reduction targets had gone awry. A report by the economic consultancy Lombard Street Research said the Dutch would be better off outside the euro after a decade of low growth. The report said the rising cost of supporting bankrupt European countries, which it put at between \u20ac1.3 trillion and \u20ac2.4tn by 2015, would force the Netherlands to accept much lower standards of living. Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for Ollie Rehn, the monetary affairs commissioner who under the new rules has the right to police national budgets, said: \"All member states should continue to respect their commitments according to the rules \u2026 They should meet agreed budgetary targets and stand ready to pursue further consolidation measures if needed. \"Let's shed all the light on what happened in Spain in 2011 because it's a serious deviation. We need to know the origin of this deviation, the nature of this deviation.\" But Rajoy is asserting national sovereignty over the new EU rules. At an EU summit on Friday when he signed up for the eurozone's binding new fiscal pact, Rajoy failed to let other EU leaders know of his budget revision. He bragged that it was none of their business. \"I'm not going to tell the other presidents or heads of state about the deficit figure that will be included in our budget,\" he said. \"I don't have to. It's a sovereign decision. I'll tell the (European) commission in April.\" The fiscal pact and new laws on \"economic governance\" enacted last year have been criticised as representing an assault on democratic choice in EU countries and as a restriction on sovereignty. The new rules have largely been written in Berlin, but even among Germany's allies in the euro crisis countries are bristling at the constraints on their freedom of manoeuvre. The Dutch, fiscal hawks strongly aligned with Germany throughout the crisis, are also at risk of breaking the rules. Faced with a deterioration in the public finances that could see the Netherlands also penalised for excessive deficits, the minority coalition government of Mark Rutte on Monday launched weeks of negotiations on spending cuts. The populist eurosceptic, Geert Wilders, who props up the government in parliament in return for policy concessions, called for a referendum on staying in the eurozone.",

      "bodyText": "Ivan Glasenberg, the multi-billionaire chief executive of commodity trader Glencore, is to embark on a global investor road show with Xstrata boss Mick Davis in an effort to win over investors reluctant to back their $37bn (\u00a323bn) \"merger of equals\". News of the planned charm offensive came as Glencore announced its first set of full-year results as a public company, in which it gave no indication that it would sweeten its offer for the miner Xtrata. Glasenberg said: \"In April Mike [Davis] and myself will go on a road show to convince investors ... A lot of Xstrata shareholders are not shareholders of Glencore. A lot think Glencore has not got 'tier one' assets. We have got to educate them that Glencore has got tier one assets.\" The company, which released an estimate for 2011 profits last month, confirmed those results, with net income up 7% to $4.06bn and a 28% rise in revenues to $186bn. It will pay a total dividend for the year of 15 cents a share, which will mean that Glasenberg \u2013 who is the biggest shareholder with a 15% stake \u2013 will receive a dividend of $109m. The chief executive added that he had declined a potential bonus of \u00a31.8m, on the grounds that he receives the \"most benefit from the growth of the company\". Glencore is offering 2.8 new shares for every Xstrata share it does not already own \u2013 about two thirds of the company. Some analysts believe Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, is likely to improve its offer in April, with Andrew Keen at HSBC saying 3.3 Glencore shares would be a fairer level. In April, documentation about the proposed tie-up will be sent to investors ahead of a vote in May. However, Glasenberg said the current offer was fair for all shareholders and insisted: \"It ain't a takeover, it's a merger of equals\". When asked why Glencore is offering a premium to Xstrata shareholders if the companies really are equal, he replied: \"Mike [Davis] is a hard negotiator\". He also pointed out that Xstrata executives will get most of the senior jobs. The latest efforts by Glasenberg to sell the Xstrata merger \u2013 a deal which was widely understood to be the reason the company floated last year \u2013 came as Zambia closed a copper treatment plant belonging to Glencore's Mopani Copper Mines for pollution violations. Glencore, which has previously been hit with a host of unwanted headlines involving Mopani over allegations that it has avoided paying \u00a3100m in local taxes, said in a statement it was surprised at the action by the environmental agency and implied it may be forced to lay off staff following the closure. \"The last visit by the Zambian Environmental Management Agency was in early February and the license was duly renewed on 21 February,\" a Glencore spokesman said. \"We are therefore surprised that we are currently required to suspend this project, which we believe may be due to recent unsubstantiated reports in the local press. We are working to resolve this situation as quickly as possible, not least because over 300 jobs depend on it. This project accounts for about 1.5% of Mopani's total production\". Glencore has always denied it owed any taxes to Zambia. Glasenberg, who did not rule out appearing in front of UK MPs conducting an enquiry on taxation in developing countries, insisted that Mopani taxes were no longer an issue in Zambia. Shares in Glencore edged down 0.1p yesterday to 403.45p. They floated at 530p just under a year ago.",

The Misys board will be hoping to match the \u00a34 a share thought to have been offered last summer by US group Fidelity National Information Services in talks which failed to result in a deal. Numis has a 360p target price on the deal, equivalent to \u00a375m of savings from a merger between Misys and Temenos plus a 10% premium on the shares, because both groups have tended to trade above peers. \"Having allegedly spurned a 400p cash bid last summer, it is hard to see Misys's board being overwhelmed by 360p now, but there may be enough shareholders looking for the door that it could work,\" said Numis analyst David Toms.",

More than one hundred years ago, Britain was importing the staple from local co-operatives along with onions and garlic to recreate the dish that in its modern chorizo and seafood form dates back to the early 19th century.</p> <p>These days water shortages mean rice is almost a local novelty. Growing fruit and salad vegetables make up the bulk of food exports as the hills that surround Spain's third largest city provide the perfect environment for oranges, clementines, lemons and other citrus fruits.</p> <p>Cooperatives are the backbone of a key industry the new right wing government of Mariano Rajoy hopes will generate bigger export receipts and keep the country afloat.</p> <p>Rajoy has his work cut out. For the past five years Spanish food and drink exports have been static. Before the credit crunch exports were nudging higher, but without much impetus.

      "bodyText": "The low lying flatlands around Valencia are still given over to growing paella rice. More than one hundred years ago, Britain was importing the staple from local co-operatives along with onions and garlic to recreate the dish that in its modern chorizo and seafood form dates back to the early 19th century. These days water shortages mean rice is almost a local novelty. Growing fruit and salad vegetables make up the bulk of food exports as the hills that surround Spain's third largest city provide the perfect environment for oranges, clementines, lemons and other citrus fruits. Cooperatives are the backbone of a key industry the new right wing government of Mariano Rajoy hopes will generate bigger export receipts and keep the country afloat. Rajoy has his work cut out. For the past five years Spanish food and drink exports have been static. Before the credit crunch exports were nudging higher, but without much impetus. A slump in 2009 was followed by a slow recovery that puts the figures for sales in 2011 only slightly ahead of the peak in 2008. The sluggish recovery of this key industry is one reason Rajoy is ready to battle the EU commission over plans for punitive fines for missing debt targets. He knows it will take time to push exports to new peaks against the headwinds of financial austerity and cheap foreign competition. Without the subsidies that propped up Spanish agriculture in the 1990s, it faces an uphill struggle, one made worse by the intense burdens of doing business in modern euroland. According to Jos\u00e9 Climent, the head of Spain's Cooperativa Agr\u00edcola, the country's largest co-op, the pressure from retailers in northern Europe to supply all year round produce, cut costs and adhere to ever-tighter environmental regulations is crushing co-ops more than the banking crisis. Climent says co-ops are too weak to comply with all the demands from the big chains after years of under investment, though he is doing his best to fight back. It is the bigger industrial concerns that can meet the needs of cost conscious and environmentally-aware consumers. Guy Dixon, commercial director of the family-controlled, private grower MartinAvarro, agrees that his firm, which has extensive citrus farms near Valencia and across the south of Spain, is better placed than the co-ops as supermarkets make ever-more stringent demands on quality, price and pesticide use. MartinAvarro has long established relationships with Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and all the other major chains to supply citrus fruits. When Valencia fruit is exhausted, the company turns to its other Spanish farms to stretch the growing season. Driving out of Valencia past its clementine and lemon groves, it is possible to see the neglect suffered by family-owned plots that make up the region's co-operative membership. Fifteen or 20 trees on a plot no bigger than a tennis court, overgrown with weeds, often augmented by a rusty piece of machinery, is a common sight. Climent believes there is almost a conspiracy against farmers with smallholdings, even when they club together in co-operatives. He exports to Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury in the UK, but reserves most of his vitriol for the German chemicals giant Bayer, which he accuses of lobbying Brussels for more environment-friendly pesticides which are weaker and must be used more often at greater cost to the grower. Climent's member-farms are also under pressure to improve the shape and colour of fruits for the supermarkets while keeping the price low. On this topic, he has another German company in his sights. \"The price of citrus fruits in Europe depends on the price decided by the chief buyer for Aldi. He sets the benchmark.

Analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> In perhaps the most positive single development post the Macondo spill, BP agreed a settlement with the plaintiffs' steering committee at the weekend which, at $7.8bn, is below most market estimates, and does not increase the $37.2bn provision. Whilst uncertainty remains, it is diminishing and fast. Our target price [of 595p] includes a pre-tax deduction of $42bn for the net cost of Macondo to BP. </blockquote> <p>But despite BP's gains, the overall market has lost ground again, on worries about a possible Greek default if it does not reach a deal with its private bondholders.

Among the major companies, BP bounced 8.1p to 504.6p after its $7.8bn (\u00a35bn) settlement relating to the Gulf of Mexico disaster over the weekend, despite concerns that there were still details of the deal, which involves 110,000 private claims, to be worked out. Analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec said: In perhaps the most positive single development post the Macondo spill, BP agreed a settlement with the plaintiffs' steering committee at the weekend which, at $7.8bn, is below most market estimates, and does not increase the $37.2bn provision. Whilst uncertainty remains, it is diminishing and fast. Our target price [of 595p] includes a pre-tax deduction of $42bn for the net cost of Macondo to BP. But despite BP's gains, the overall market has lost ground again, on worries about a possible Greek default if it does not reach a deal with its private bondholders. News that China has cut its growth targets has also helped send the FTSE 100 down 36.31 points to 5874.82. The Chinese news hit mining shares, given the importance of the country for commodity companies. Kazakhmys, which unveiled disappointing figures last week, was down 48.5p to 951.5p while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed 24p lower at 675p. Glencore fell 16.65p to 403.35p after its in-line figures, while its proposed merger partner Xstrata lost 59p to 1137.5p on disappointment there was no news of better terms for the deal. Serco slipped 33p to 527p after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the outsourcing specialist from buy to neutral, saying the share price was up with events. Essar Energy fell 6.7p to 107.1p ahead of its likely demotion from the FTSE 100, based on Tuesday's nights closing prices. Also expected to depart the leading index are Cairn Energy, down 4.9p at 332p, and Hargreaves Lansdown, 0.2p lower at 445.3p. The biggest riser in the leading index was Intertek, up 58p at \u00a323.72 after the testing company reported a 23% rise in full year profits. Oil services group Petrofac put on 21p to \u00a315.95 following a 25% rise in full year profits and a confident outlook statement. Defensive stocks were back in favour, with GlaxoSmithKline up 14.5p at \u00a314.04 and AstraZeneca adding 23.5p to \u00a328.41. Tesco dipped 1.55p to 316.7p despite unveiling plans to create 20,000 jobs over the next two years. Fitch said the move should lure back some customers although Tesco would have to keep adjusting prices to keep its market share close to current levels. Among the mid-caps Dunelm, the homewares retailer, fell sharply after news that former chief executive Will Adderley and his wife had cashed in around \u00a336m worth of shares in the business. Adderley, the son of the company's founder who remains executive deputy chairman, and his wife sold 7.5m shares in a placing managed by UBS. The shares represent around 2.5% of Dunelm's share capital. Adderley told the company the move was to diversify his share portfolio, and he agreed not to sell more shares for at least six months. His remaining stake gives him around 32.4% of the company, while the Adderley family in total retain 56.2%. Dunelm dropped 25.7p to 482.8p. Lower down the market GCM Resources rose 7.63p to 89p on talk of an imminent deal. Finally Energetix added 1.75p to 27.5p after ScottishPower agreed to trial the company's combined heat and power boilers. Energetix claims the boilers can reduce fuel bills and provide income for the customer since they generate electricity which can be sold back to the grid.",

There was nothing wrong with Glencore's full-year results \u2013 profits, ignoring exceptional items, were up 7% at $4.06bn (\u00a32.6bn), as expected \u2013 but nor were there any great revelations about the quality of its assets.
