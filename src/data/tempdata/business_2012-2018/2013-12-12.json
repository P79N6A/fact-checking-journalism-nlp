      "bodyText": "The role of auditors at banks and building societies was called into question on Thursday when a top regulatory body warned it would subject the industry to close scrutiny next year. Five years on from the financial crisis when banks had to be bailed out by taxpayers, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said improvements in the quality of audits of banks and building societies had not been sufficient. It said it would conduct a formal review of the 2013 sets of accounts in the second quarter of next year. \"Over the last five years, the FRC has increased its monitoring of bank and building society audits in its annual programme of audit quality inspections, but the findings have shown they are below the average of all audits inspected,\" the FRC said. The role of auditors has faced scrutiny since the financial crisis when they failed to sound the alarm about the problems being stored up inside banks and building societies which ended up running out of capital to support their losses. The nonexecutive directors who chair the audit committees of banks and building societies are also to face pressure to improve the quality of the audits they commission from the major accountancy firms. The FRC said its ongoing audit inspections had already started to find problems in audits of banks and building societies. It highlighted two main areas of scrutiny \u2013 the way banks decide how large their losses are on bad debts and the accuracy of the information banks are able to provide about their businesses. Lady Hogg, FRC chairwoman, said: \"Concerns about the quality of auditing of banks and building societies persist, not least from our own inspections of audits and despite enhanced corporate governance requirements. \"We are clear that there is scope for improvement and we hope to see a genuine step change in the quality of bank and building society auditing in the UK\". The audit profession is already being forced to under go change by the competition authority which is requiring companies to put their audit work out to tender. HSBC was one of the first major banks to change its auditor \u2013 KPMG \u2013 after more than 20 years. It is most lucrative audit in the FTSE 100 with fees of more than \u00a350m a year and HSBC intends to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers from 2015. PwC also audits Barclays and bailed out Lloyds Banking Group. PwC said: \"The quality of our audit work, including that of our banking clients, is already subject to robust inspection by the FRC's audit quality review team. \"We remain committed to continuing to achieve the highest levels of quality and continue to support measures that seek to improve audit quality and build confidence in the profession and market.\" Deloitte is auditor to Royal Bank of Scotland.

Yes, many Sports Direct stores are scruffy. But, for heaven's sake, we're talking about a football strip, not designer garb that requires catwalks and flashbulbs. The nonsense of Adidas's stance is illustrated by the fact it will still allow its Chelsea training kits to enter the Ashley emporium. Sports Direct, let's hope, will execute a tackle on Adidas in the style of Ron \"Chopper\" Harris, Chelsea's legendary hard man in the 1970s. Refusing to sell a few Adidas lines should do the trick. While we await that confrontation, let's not forget Sports Direct's own contribution to cant. Once again the retailer bragged that its employee share scheme, which has just produced \"life changing\" sums among 1,800 permanent staff, played a large part in the group's commercial success (half-year profits may have disappointed the City but they still rose 14.3% to \u00a3143m). The claim about the role of the bonus scheme is robust, no doubt.

High fashion stores such as River Island and ASOS were offering the biggest average discounts of the 30 sites monitored by INstock in the UK.</p> <p>But the biggest increase in discounting, from an average 15% two weeks ago to 23% this week, came from premium retailers such as Selfridges and John Lewis, driven by House of Fraser, the privately-owned department store.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the accountancy firm PwC found average discounts of 42% being advertised this week compared to 36% at the same time last year and 39% last week across the 100 major high street retailers it monitors, including fashion, department stores and others.</p> <p>Among fashion retailers, Lorna Hall, head of retail and strategy at WGSN, said that some of the biggest discounts were being seen on onesies \"People are realising that their selling window is short.

That's good for them and we thrive in that environment.\" Figures from trend agency WGSN's INstock service, which monitors online stores, have revealed that women's fashion retailers were discounting by an average 32% with fast fashion retailers including H&amp;M, New Look and Dorothy Perkins all putting stock on sale in recent days. High fashion stores such as River Island and ASOS were offering the biggest average discounts of the 30 sites monitored by INstock in the UK. But the biggest increase in discounting, from an average 15% two weeks ago to 23% this week, came from premium retailers such as Selfridges and John Lewis, driven by House of Fraser, the privately-owned department store. Meanwhile, the accountancy firm PwC found average discounts of 42% being advertised this week compared to 36% at the same time last year and 39% last week across the 100 major high street retailers it monitors, including fashion, department stores and others. Among fashion retailers, Lorna Hall, head of retail and strategy at WGSN, said that some of the biggest discounts were being seen on onesies \"People are realising that their selling window is short. There is a lot of stock out there and it's now all about price to get the share of shoppers' Christmas budget.\" Onesies were last Christmas's big novelty hit, but they have been overtaken somewhat by Christmas jumpers this year leading some retail insiders to fear they may be left with large amounts of stock on the shelves. Asda said earlier this week that it expected to sell 10m novelty jumpers over the Christmas period but just 3m onesies, although that is still three times more onesies than they sold last year. However, it appears that clothing retailers' experience is not being reflected right across the retail market. Accountancy firm PwC's survey found that this week 64% of the 100 chains it looks at were on sale or advertising promotions in their shop window, up from 62% last week. That proportion is down on this time last year when 69%were on sale but well up on the 55% seen in 2010. David Oliver, head of retail consulting, at PwC said: \"We are not seeing panic but I do think the market has changed and that consumers have been trained to expect discounts before Christmas so there is certainly a cohort who wait for that to happen.\" \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 13 December 2013 to clarify that the figures on the timing of Asda shoppers' Christmas spend was from a survey.",

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan Chase, the biggest bank in the US, is facing another multi-billion dollar fine, this time deriving from its involvement with notorious Ponzi scheme fraudster Bernard Madoff. The bank has tentatively agreed to pay $2bn to settle allegations it failed to inform US authorities of the jailed fraudsters suspicious activity, according to people familiar with negotiations. A settlement deal with the Justice Department could come as early as next week. The bank declined to comment. Madoff was arrested at his Manhattan penthouse five years ago this week after his $20bn scam came to light. JP Morgan was his bank for two decades and the US authorities suspect it continued to service his business even as it suspected something was wrong. The fraudster himself predicted the bank would one day face a big fine. In a 2011 interview with the Financial Times he said: \u201cJPMorgan doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell of not coming up with a big settlement.\u201d He claimed: \u201cThere were people at the bank who knew what was going on,\u201d an assertion that JP Morgan has consistently claimed is false. According to court papers filed by Irving Picard, the trustee charged with recouping losses for Madoff\u2019s victims, the bank had grave doubts about Madoff 18 months before his scam unwound. The documents quote one banker claiming Madoff\u2019s \u201cOz-like signals\u201d were difficult to ignore. The filings also quote a June 2007 email from a senior JP Morgan banker warning colleagues that another banker \u201cjust told me that there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme.\u201d The bank filed a \u201csuspicious activity\u201d report with UK authorities in 2008 but did not take a similar step in the US. JP Morgan has always denied wrongdoing and disputes Picard\u2019s findings but this week chief executive Jamie Dimon signalled that a deal was in the offing and suggested it was easier for the bank to settle than to fight its corner in court. \u201cYou read about Madoff in the paper the other day. We have to get some of these things behind us so we can do our job,\u201d he told a conference in New York on Wednesday, first reported by the Financial Times. According to a report in the New York Times on Thursday, the settlement would include a so-called deferred-prosecution agreement. Such an agreement would list all of JP Morgan\u2019s alleged criminal wrongdoings but stop short of an indictment as long as the bank acknowledges wrongdoing and pays the fines. The agreement would be the second time in a month that JP Morgan has been forced to acknowledge wrongdoing.

That settlement too required the bank to own up to wrongdoing, something Wall Street has fought against for fear of triggering more shareholder lawsuits. If the fine comes before Christmas it will cap an annus horribilis for JP Morgan. Alongside the $13bn fine for its involvement in the subprime loan scandal, JP Morgan has: paid $4.5bn in November to settle allegations it has mis-sold mortgage bonds to pension funds and other institutional investors; paid $920m in September to settle US investigations into the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading scandal; in the same month, paid another $390m in refunds and $80m in settlement for billing credit card customers for identity theft protection they did not receive; paid $410m in penalties and repayments in July related to alleged manipulation of California and midwest electricity markets; Investors, however, have largely discounted the historic scandals and the bank\u2019s share price is currently close to a year high.",

      "bodyText": "Former City minister Lord Myners is to lead the overhaul of the management structure of the Co-operative Group after scandals at its banking arm that have seen control ceded to its bondholders and its former chairman accused of using illegal drugs. Taking on the high profile role at the mutual for the token sum of \u00a31 a year, Myners indicated that the 20-strong board is likely to be slimmed down as part of his review. With the outflow of current accounts from the Co-op bank following the allegations about former chairman and methodist minister Paul Flowers stabilising, the complex restructuring of the bank should be completed next week. The bank is racing to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall in an intricate deal that will leave the group of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes losing control of the bank and being left with just a 30% stake, with the remainder owned by bondholders, including hedge funds. The changing ownership structure has raised concerns about its ability to retain its ethical stance. Myners, who was City minister in the Labour government from October 2008 until the 2010 general election, refused to pre-empt the outcome of an ongoing review into the group's donations to the Labour Party. Himself a Methodist and a member of the Co-op, Myners is a former high profile fund manager but has a wide range of business interests including chairing an activist shareholder group Cevian as well as having a seat on the board of the controversial Russian mobile phone company MegaFon. His appointment as senior independent director is the latest attempt by country's biggest mutual to rebuild its reputation. He will be joined by two other independent non-executives which will already represent a change in the structure of the board, which is usually made up of 20 elected members from the co-operative movement. \"The board of the Co-op is larger than most company boards but this reflects the democratic tradition of the Co-op. Questions will clearly be raised about how you get the right competency and boardroom skills,\" said Myners. The chairman Len Wardle quit in the wake of the allegations about the private life of Flowers and even before he did so had already suggested his successor should be appointed from outside the movement. But Wardle's sudden departure meant his deputy, Ursula Lidbetter, was named chairman. \"We have made it clear that we need to modernise and to embed the very best standards of corporate governance \u2013 while also ensuring that the voices of all our members and customers resonate through the business,\" she said. Myners' review will look at how the board is \"constituted and chaired\" and is likely to be completed before the next annual meeting in May. The board is already braced for heavy criticism from the review by Sir Christopher Kelly into the events that led to the Co-op bank's \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall \u2013 one of a number of investigations into the bank. City regulators and accountancy regulators are also considering whether to launch inquiries. Euan Sutherland, the chief executive of the Co-op group, said Myners' \"leadership on the governance review will be crucial\". The Co-op did not release details of Myners's salary but it is understood he will be paid a token \u00a31 a year, and will also be entitled to claim expenses. A non-executive director at the group would typically be paid an annual salary of \u00a360,000. Myners \u2013 regarded as a potential next chairman of the overall group \u2013 acknowledged the struggle facing the bank and said he would work with the rest of the board to ensure the group realised its potential. \"Right now it faces serious challenges in terms of business performance and ensuring that the right governance is in place to deliver in the interests of all its members and customers.\"",

Monsignor Nunzio Scarano is currently on trial in Rome charged with corruption and slander.</p> <p>&#xa0;The report, by Moneyval, a Council of Europe body that monitors safeguards against money-laundering and terrorist funding, revealed that the financial clampdown, which began under pope Benedict, had led to a surge in reports of suspect transactions. It said the Holy See\u2019s supervisory body, the Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA), had received 105 notifications of suspect transactions in the first 10 months of 2013, compared to just six last year.</p> <p>&#xa0;The reporting had led to three cases being referred to the Vatican\u2019s prosecutors for investigation. They are known to have included the Scarano affair.</p> <p>&#xa0;But no details were provided of others. A table in the report showedthe Vatican prosecutors had seized a total of \u20ac1.98m in one case, again presumably that involving Scarano.</p> <p>Moneyval said \u201ca very wide range of legislative and other measures have been taken in a short time\u201d to implement recommendations that it made last year. The powers of the FIA were now much clearer.</p> <p>&#xa0;But it said the authority, headed by a Swiss lawyer, Rene (ED: ACUTE ON E) Bruelhart, needed more resources. It was especially important to bring in \u201cexperienced professionals\u201d to monitor the soundness of the Vatican\u2019s financial institutions.</p> <p>&#xa0;It said that the FIA planned to comb through the books of the Vatican \u2018bank\u2019 this month or next. But there appeared to be no firm plan yet for a visit to APSA.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/moneyval/Evaluations/progress%20reports/MONEYVAL(2013)28_HS_ProgRep1_en.pdf\"><strong>The report is online here (pdf)</strong></a>.&#xa0;</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-12T15:55:27.550Z\">at 3.55pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a9d94be4b07fd4d02fa562\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-12T15:42:13.805Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-78446be7-37a9-4e8c-84f6-289255a3b8d1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386862921056/f73ee24e-21a8-403f-bc41-7d132f0f4b56-460x324.jpeg\" alt=\"Street musicians perform in front of a sign for Abanka cash machine in Ljubljana December 12, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street musicians performing in front of a sign for Abanka cash machine in Ljubljana today.

This was identified by the Council as an urgent priority in order for Slovenia to address its excessive macroeconomic imbalances. The assessment, carried out by four leading external consultants within the timeframe specified by the Council and using a credible methodology, has delivered reliable results. This process was conducted in very close cooperation with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority.</p> <p>I look forward to the effective implementation of the strategy for banking sector repair and modernisation outlined today by the Slovenian authorities. This represents a convincing and robust response to one of the key challenges facing the country. It is also critical that Slovenia moves forward with the broader economic reform agenda, in particular strengthening corporate governance and carrying out privatisations and regulatory reforms to improve the business environment. Swift and decisive progress on all of these fronts will be essential to restore confidence, boost investment and create the conditions for sustainable growth and higher employment. The Commission will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the relevant policies, in partnership with the Slovenian authorities.</p> <p>When the Commission concluded eight months ago that the Slovenian economy was suffering from excessive imbalances, I stated that the situation was still manageable provided swift and decisive policy action was taken. While significant challenges remain, I am pleased to say that this has so far been the case. Today it is clear that Slovenia can proceed with the repair of its financial sector without turning to her European partners for financial assistance. This is good news and demonstrates both the paramount importance of decisive action by the authorities and the fact that the overall economic recovery of the eurozone is now solidly underway.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a99779e4b07fd4d02fa535\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-12T11:10:59.526Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Slovenia's smaller lenders are starting to say how much money they'll need to raise, under the recapitalisation plan being announced this morning.</p> <p><strong>Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank</strong> has said it needs \u20ac221m of extra capital, while&#xa0;<strong>Unicredit Slovenia</strong> needs an additional \u20ac14m.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-12T11:20:37.908Z\">at 11.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a99401e4b04dee990ffe66\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-12T10:59:05.799Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Slovenia's finance minister&#xa0;Uros Cufer has told reporters that the country will issue a \u20ac1bn bond to help fund the recapitalisation of its ailing banks.</strong></p> <p>Cufer said the bond has been 'created', but not yet sold.&#xa0;That's via Reuters' Ljubljana bureau.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/411085118569078785\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Slovenian 1 Bln Euro Bond Issued On Wednesday Not Yet Sold - Finmin Cufer</p>&mdash; cigolo (@cigolo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/411085118569078785\">December 12, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That helps explain how Slovenia plans to find its \u20ac3bn share of the&#xa0;\u20ac4.78bn bill.</p> <p>PM&#xa0;Alenka Bratusek's government had allocated&#xa0;\u20ac1.2bn&#xa0;of public funds to the task.

      "bodyText": "That's all for today. Reminder that the details of the Slovenia bank plan are covered here. With Open Europe's analysis, and concerns, arriving later Cheers and goodnight. GW Some late news... Fitch's new top sovereign analyst has warned that it will take time for Britain to win its AAA rating back, having been downgraded to AA+ in April. James McCormack told Reuters that recent growth rates won't send Fitch rushing to upgrade the UK again. He also said that the agency will decide whether to downgrade the US (currently AAA) in the next few months. Here's the details: Fitch followed rival agency Moody's in downgrading Britain to AA+ in April, but since then the country's economy has fired to such an extent that it is now one of the fasting growing in the developed world. \"At the time I think that was the right call to make,\" McCormack told Reuters. \"Projections that we were working off showed debt peaking at a level higher than we previously anticipated and further out than anticipated.\" \"Some of the adjustment that has gone on since then has been a pleasant surprise for everyone ... but one of the things we have said about getting triple-A ratings back is that it is going to take some time.\" He said he certainly would not be rushing to reverse April's downgrade. While the economy was clearly enjoying a hot run, there were questions over whether it could continue. \"We probably need to see medium-term projections of debt-to-GDP coming down in a sustainable way over a period of time,\" he said.\"So one quarter or six-months worth of data is generally not something we are going to change our rating view on.\" Unless the FTSE 100 manages a big rally tomorrow, it will post its 6th weekly fall in a row. That, according to Josh Raymond of City Index, hasn't happened in over five years. European stock markets have closed in the red, pushed down by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve starting to slow its bond-buying stimulus programme . Those better-than-expected US retail sales figures have fuelled expectations that the Fed will taper soon, knocking the Dow Jones index down 122 points or 0.8%. In London, the FTSE closed 62 points lower at 6,445, -0.96%. The big faller was Sports Direct, tumbling 12% after issuing less bullish forecasts today. David Madden, market analyst at IG, explain: Stocks are sliding as the wind of change picks up. Equity markets are edgy ahead of next week's US Federal Reserve meeting; judging by the sea of red on trading screens, investors are pointing towards a taper. Despite the jitters today, hotel firm Hilton successfully floated on the US stock market today. Its shares are up by a respectable 7.5% so far. Back to Slovenia, and the Open Europe think tank is concerned that the economic forecasts used to assess its banks are too optimistic. Even under the adverse scenario, exports are expected to add 1.1% to GDP next year, and 1.3% in 2015 - even though Slovenia is currently in recession. Open Europe has published analysis of the tests, and says: For Slovenia, and others, relying on exports alone to prop up GDP can be a risky game. They added: As a result of this bank recapitalisation, Slovenia's government debt will rise to 75.6% of GDP. Not massive by standards of the eurozone crisis, but high enough that we could see upward pressure on borrowing costs, especially given the poor growth outlook for the economy. It also means that both the public and private sector in Slovenia is heavily indebted. This risks weighing on the economy, and could potentially create a downward spiral as domestic demand, investment and government spending falls. One of the more astonishing figures (to us) is that the stress tests cost \u20ac21 million to conduct, due to fees for the consulting firms such as Oliver Wyman, Roland Berger, Ernst &amp; Young, and Deloitte. So far, then, Slovenia has managed to avoid the need for external aid, despite a significant overhaul of its banking sector. However, the economy remains in a fragile state, and any shocks to the system over the next six months, as the overhaul takes place, could push the economy into a wider and deeper crisis. The Vatican\u2019s efforts to clean up its financial institutions have been welcomed by international watchdogs in a report today. But they expressed surprise that the Holy See\u2019s regulators had not yet made full inspections of either the Vatican \u2018bank\u2019 or the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA), the department that manages the papacy\u2019s assets. Our Southern European editor, John Hooper, reports: Both were embroiled in scandal earlier this year when Italian police arrested an APSA official who allegedly tried to smuggle \u20ac20m in cash into Italy from Switzerland by way of the Vatican bank, properly known as the Institute for the Works of Religion (IOR). Monsignor Nunzio Scarano is currently on trial in Rome charged with corruption and slander. The report, by Moneyval, a Council of Europe body that monitors safeguards against money-laundering and terrorist funding, revealed that the financial clampdown, which began under pope Benedict, had led to a surge in reports of suspect transactions. It said the Holy See\u2019s supervisory body, the Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA), had received 105 notifications of suspect transactions in the first 10 months of 2013, compared to just six last year. The reporting had led to three cases being referred to the Vatican\u2019s prosecutors for investigation. They are known to have included the Scarano affair. But no details were provided of others. A table in the report showedthe Vatican prosecutors had seized a total of \u20ac1.98m in one case, again presumably that involving Scarano. Moneyval said \u201ca very wide range of legislative and other measures have been taken in a short time\u201d to implement recommendations that it made last year. The powers of the FIA were now much clearer. But it said the authority, headed by a Swiss lawyer, Rene (ED: ACUTE ON E) Bruelhart, needed more resources. It was especially important to bring in \u201cexperienced professionals\u201d to monitor the soundness of the Vatican\u2019s financial institutions. It said that the FIA planned to comb through the books of the Vatican \u2018bank\u2019 this month or next. But there appeared to be no firm plan yet for a visit to APSA. The report is online here (pdf). Perform Group, the online sports video supplier, looks more like Underperform Group after a shock profit warning this lunchtime. Its share price has more than halved after it hit investors with the news that revenues this year will be 6% lower than forecast.

Real consumption growth in the fourth quarter is on course to be at least double the third quarter\u2019s 1.4% annualised gain. Perhaps the US jobs market isn't as strong as economists thought? Or perhaps the latest data is just a blip? The weekly unemployment data showed a surprise jump in people signing on for jobless benefit. The initial claims total leapt by 68,000 people, the biggest increase since November 2012. That pushed the initial claims total up to 368,000 in the week to December 7, from 300,000 the previous week. Jamie McGeever of Reuters reckons it's the sixth largest increase since the early 1980s. The continued claims total also rose, to 2.791m from 2.751m. The week in question does include Thanksgiving, so it's a volatile time. In other US economic news... retail sales were a little stronger than expected last month - up by 0.7% versus forecasts of +0.6%. And here's economics editor Larry Elliott's take: A fresh attack on Britain's welfare budget was announced by George Osborne on Thursday as he told MPs he would prefer to cut benefitsthan slash the size of the state to its smallest since the 1940s. In a calculated political challenge to Labour in the runup to the next election, the chancellor said many more billions would need to be shaved from welfare to avoid deeper cuts in spending by Whitehall departments. George Osborne announces fresh attack on welfare budget Back in the UK, politics liveblogger Andy Sparrow has summarised the key points from George Osborne's appearance at the Treasury Committee. George Osborne's evidence to the Treasury committee on the autumn statement - Summary The most important economic line is that the chancellor predicts billions of pounds of additional cuts to the welfare bill in the next parliament. \u2022 Osborne said that welfare spending would have to be cut by billions of pounds after the next general election. He first made the prediction when Labour's Pat McFadden asked him if he accepted the prediction from the Office for Budget Responsibility last week that state spending on services would have to fall to the level it was in 1948. Osborne said he did not accept that - because a future government would choose to cut welfare spending (which is not included in the services metric used by the OBR) instead, allowing more money to be spend on services. I think that assumption is based on what I think is an erroneous judgment about what the political system will do. They are perfectly right that on the current plans that's what it shows. But I think the next government will want to undertake further reductions in the welfare budget and further welfare savings. If you undertake further welfare savings then you don't reach that 1948 number. Fears that the eurozone could be hit with another bailout have eased after independent stress tests on Slovenia's debt-laden banking sector were published. The country's central bank announced that Slovenia's banks need a total of \u20ac4.8bn of fresh capital. That's slightly more than analysts had expected, but the country insists it can raise the funds. Slovenia's three largest banks, all largely state-owned, need \u20ac3bn of fresh capital. Alenka Bratusek's government will to provide the funds -- \u20ac2bn of cash and almost \u20ac1bn in bonds. Junior bondholders are also sharing the pain, being hit for around \u20ac500m. The remaining \u20ac1.6bn is needed by Slovenia's smaller lenders, who have until next June to raise around \u20ac1.1bn in the private markets. The recapitalisation will deal with the bad debts that have piled up in the Slovenian banking sector since it fell into recession. The former Yugoslav province has suffered the consequences of a credit boom before the crisis began. The Slovenian government now faces most of the bill for the clean-up, having not fully privatised its banks since getting independence. Although today's bill is at the upper end of expectations, there were signs of relief in the financial markets. Slovenia's bonds strengthened in value after the results were announced. The European commission has also welcomed the results, saying it is confident that Slovenia can find the funding itself. Commissioner Olli Rehn said: Today it is clear that Slovenia can proceed with the repair of its financial sector without turning to her European partners for financial assistance. This is good news and demonstrates both the paramount importance of decisive action by the authorities and the fact that the overall economic recovery of the eurozone is now solidly underway. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, also said Slovenia wouldn't need help: I welcome the transparent communication of the results and was reassured by the Slovenian authorities that they will use their own sovereign capacity to adequately cover the final capital needs of the banking sector. In other news.... World stock markets are sliding today as traders anticipate the Federal Reserve cutting its bond-buying programme soon. As this image shows, the main European indices are all down, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.6% or 40 points. The EU has agreed landmark rules to handle failed banks - from 2016, bondholders and unsecured creditors will be 'bailed-in', in a move that means taxpayers are much less likely to foot the bill. Eurozone industrial production was surprisingly weak in October, falling by 1.1% More reaction on Slovenia's bank stress tests. Timothy Ash, head of emerging markets research at Standard Bank said: \"This is a credible number, and the market will be relieved that it is on the table now, and realistic,\" Reuters's team in Slovenia flag up that the country's central bank governor, Bostjan Jazbec, insisted that today's stress results (see 10.26am onwards) are fully trustworthy: \"There is no concern or need to doubt these results,\" Jazbec told a news conference. A government statement said the recapitalisation would ensure \"a way out of the crisis,\" but analysts were still digesting the numbers. \"It is hard to see what the total cost is,\" said Igor Masten, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Ljubljana. \"There is much more they will have to clarify.\" Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, has issued his own statement on the Slovenian bank tests. Dijsselbloem (who's also the Dutch finance minister) doesn't indicate that he expects a bailout request from Slovenia: Today, the Slovenian authorities have presented the results of the stress test and asset quality review. I am confident that the recapitalisation of the banking sector, in combination with the implementation of the measures aimed at restructuring the financial as well as the corporate sector, will stabilise Slovenia's banking sector. Stronger banks and an improved business environment will lay the foundation for the economic recovery. I welcome the transparent communication of the results and was reassured by the Slovenian authorities that they will use their own sovereign capacity to adequately cover the final capital needs of the banking sector. A couple more snaps from Slovenia this morning. The stock market selloff has picked up through the morning - the FTSE 100 has now shed 65 points, or 1%, to 6441. The other European markets are also in the red, with the German DAX losing 0.7%. The weak eurozone industrial output date (see 10.11am) hit sentiment, as traders continued to fret that the Federal Reserve will take the plunge and ease back on its stimulus programme this month or in January. Alexander Young, Senior Sales Trader at CMC Markets says traders are also waiting for US retail sales data this afternoon: European indices followed their US counterparts lower this morning, as equity markets attempt to price in the possibility of a Fed taper, the prospect of which is becoming more real by the day. That the market is left to second guess both the timing and the size of any such reduction in the Fed's $85 billion bond purchasing program has created sufficient uncertainty amongst traders to take some risk off the table in advance of todays US data. Back to Slovenia -- and the value of its government bonds is rising as traders digest the details of the recapitalisation plan. The yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds -- the key measure of risk -- has fallen sharply, from 5.6% last night to 5.34% now, a drop of 26 basis points. A 7% yield has been seen as the level at which a country has lost access to the financial markets - so this early reaction backs up Olli Rehn's argument that Slovenia won't need a bailout. It also encouraging for Slovenia as it looks for buyers for the \u20ac1bn bond created to help fund today's bill. Breaking away from Slovenia, the UK's financial watchdog has announced that one man has been arrested today as part of an investigation into possible insider dealing. The Financial Conduct Authority said: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with the assistance of the North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire Police has this morning executed a search warrant in Harrogate. One male, aged 49, has been arrested and is currently in custody to be questioned in connection with an investigation into Insider Dealing and Market Abuse. No further details can be confirmed at this time and no individuals have been charged. The arrests are not linked to any other ongoing insider dealing investigation. European Commissioner Olli Rehn has declared that Slovenia can clearly recapitalise its banking sector without seeking international help. In a statement just released, Rehn welcomed the details of today's stress tests, which found that Slovenian banks need almost \u20ac4.8bn of new capital to cover bad debts (details start at 10.26am). Rehn added that Slovenia still faces challenges (the once-fast growing country is now locked in recession), but was adamant that it won't require a bailout. Here's the full statement from Rehn. I welcome today\u2019s publication of the independent assessment of the health and resilience of the Slovenian banking sector. This was identified by the Council as an urgent priority in order for Slovenia to address its excessive macroeconomic imbalances. The assessment, carried out by four leading external consultants within the timeframe specified by the Council and using a credible methodology, has delivered reliable results. This process was conducted in very close cooperation with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority. I look forward to the effective implementation of the strategy for banking sector repair and modernisation outlined today by the Slovenian authorities. This represents a convincing and robust response to one of the key challenges facing the country. It is also critical that Slovenia moves forward with the broader economic reform agenda, in particular strengthening corporate governance and carrying out privatisations and regulatory reforms to improve the business environment. Swift and decisive progress on all of these fronts will be essential to restore confidence, boost investment and create the conditions for sustainable growth and higher employment. The Commission will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the relevant policies, in partnership with the Slovenian authorities. When the Commission concluded eight months ago that the Slovenian economy was suffering from excessive imbalances, I stated that the situation was still manageable provided swift and decisive policy action was taken. While significant challenges remain, I am pleased to say that this has so far been the case. Today it is clear that Slovenia can proceed with the repair of its financial sector without turning to her European partners for financial assistance. This is good news and demonstrates both the paramount importance of decisive action by the authorities and the fact that the overall economic recovery of the eurozone is now solidly underway. Slovenia's smaller lenders are starting to say how much money they'll need to raise, under the recapitalisation plan being announced this morning. Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank has said it needs \u20ac221m of extra capital, while Unicredit Slovenia needs an additional \u20ac14m. Slovenia's finance minister Uros Cufer has told reporters that the country will issue a \u20ac1bn bond to help fund the recapitalisation of its ailing banks. Cufer said the bond has been 'created', but not yet sold. That's via Reuters' Ljubljana bureau. That helps explain how Slovenia plans to find its \u20ac3bn share of the \u20ac4.78bn bill. PM Alenka Bratusek's government had allocated \u20ac1.2bn of public funds to the task. Last week, Bratusek said the state has \"more than \u20ac5bn on its account\", so could cover a higher bill if needed. It can also impose losses on junior bond holders, to raise another \u20ac500m. Eurozone experts are reacting to the news that Slovenia needs almost \u20ac4.8bn to recapitalise its banks: Here's Reuters' early take from Ljubljana: Slovenia's banks need 4.8 billion euros extra capital, of which 3 billion will go to the top three state banks from government funds and bonds, the government said on Thursday. The figures are within a range the euro zone member has said previously it can afford without seeking an international bailout. The government gave five smaller banks until June to raise 1.6 billion euros in private capital. In its new report, just released, Slovenia's central bank gives some details of the \u20ac4.758bn cost of cleaning up the banking sector of its bad debts. The country's biggest three banks need \u20ac3.12bn, which will be paid through government funds and bonds. Another five banks need a total of \u20ac1.6bn - and have been given until June 2014 to raise the funds on the private markets. Slovenia's central bank also said that the operation will take the country's national debt to 75.6% of GDP. News is breaking on the wires that Slovenia's bank clean-up bill will be \u20ac4.758bn, according to its central bank governor. That's slightly higher than the government had officially expected -- Alenka Bratusek's administration had got permission to spend \u20ac4.7bn. But it is probably still low enough for Slovenia to handle without resorting to a bailout. More to follow (and a reminder that there's a preview of the Slovenian situation at 8.21am) One early news line from George Osborne at the Treasury committee - the 2014 budget will (probably) take place on March 19. Bad economic news from the eurozone -- industrial production in the euro area fell by 1.1% in October, month-on-month. On an annual basis, production was up by just 0.2% compared with October 2012. It was driven by a 2.4% drop in production of durable consumer goods, and a 4% slide in energy production. September's data was revised higher, though, to show a 0.2% fall in output, from -0.5% previously. George Osborne is about to appear before the Treasury Committee to discuss the autumn statement. It's being streamed here. And our politics liveblogger, Andrew Sparrow, is going to cover the session in detail: George Osborne questioned by Treasury committee on autumn statement: Politics live blog Europe's stock markets are all in the red still (FTSE 100 down 35 points or 0.55%). Monex Capital Markets says the markets appear \"genuinely spooked\" by the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week: Most markets across Asia finished the day underwater with even Shanghai slumping just before the close and it's all pointing back to the fall-out that will result when the Fed eventually starts to wind in the massive stimulus program - a move that is taking on even more credibility now the budget wrangling has been deferred for another couple of years. What's more, with very little in the way of fundamental data due for release between now and the weekend break the real risk is that traders become pre-occupied with the inevitable, leading to the acceleration of the current round of selling. Spanish and Italian government bonds are falling in value this morning, following reports that the European Central Bank could crack down on banks who are loading up on sovereign debt. This is pushing up bond yields (the interest rate on their debt). The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is up 6 basis points at 4.1%, from 4.04% last night. Italian 10-year bond yields are up 5 basis points, also to 4.1%, from 4.05%. This comes after Peter Praet, European Central Bank executive board member, told the FT that the ECB could force banks to hold capital against their sovereign bond holdings (often treated as risk-free). This could deter weaker lenders using its money to mop up sovereign debt from crisis-hit countries. 09:17:10 REUTERS - TRADERS SAYS SPAIN, ITALY YIELDS RISE DUE TO FT REPORT ECB COULD ASK BANKS TO HOLD CAPITAL AGAINST SOVEREIGN BONDS Here's a flavour of the FT story: The central bank will try to bring about the change in regulatory thinking using its health check of the eurozone\u2019s 130 biggest lenders alongside any new offer of cheap long-term liquidity. Mr Praet said if sovereign bonds were treated \u201caccording to the risk that they pose to banks\u2019 capital\u201d during the health check, then lenders would be less likely to use central bank liquidity to buy yet more government debt. Both Spain and Italy's bond yields have fallen sharply since the ECB promised in 2012 to do whatever it took to protect the single currency. The vicious circle between sovereigns and national banks has continued to spin since, as lenders mopped up national bonds. Credit Agricole's astute economist, Frederik Ducrozet, explains: The Financial Times says the new rules for EU bank bail-ins (see 9.10am onwards) are a \"landmark\" moment. Their correspondent, Alex Barker, also flags up that the deal is a compromise -- as governments will get more flexibility to recapitalise banks with public money if there's a major crisis. Banks could still be nationalised, but only after sufficient creditors have been 'bailed in'. One of the main sticking points in the six-month talks was the introduction of provisions that allowed governments to pump public money into banks. EU finance ministers sought discretion to recapitalise viable banks on a \u201cprecautionary\u201d basis, while the parliament wanted an option to use \u201cgovernment stabilisation tools\u201d in an emergency. Under the deal, the nationalisation of a bank would be possible in exceptional circumstances, and only after 8 per cent of liabilities of a bank have been bailed-in. Uninsured deposits of individuals (with over \u20ac100k) and small companies are given preferential status in the bail-in pecking order, he adds. AFP has summed up the key points of the new agreement for handling failed EU banks: The new system will take effect from 2016. The \"bail-in\" will primarily require important hits to be taken by shareholders and bond holders of a financial institution in trouble. Small depositors will be explicitly excluded from incurring any costs but depositors with more than 100,000 euros ($137,000) could be affected, though lastly under a pre-defined hierarchy, the European parliament said in a statement. For each member state a fund will be established which will come to the aid of banks in order to help them recover or to wind them down. These funds will be built up through bank contributions and by 2025 should reach the level of one percent of the covered deposits of the banks in that country. All banks will have to contribute but those contributions will be bigger for the banks that take the bigger risks, said Barnier. However the deal does not exclude the possibility of public money being used \"in exceptional circumstances,\" the parliamentary statement said. The days of European taxpayers footing the bill for bank rescue deals could soon be over - or at least become a rarety. Overnight. officials representing the European Parliament and EU member states agreed new rules for future bank rescues. Under the bank resolution and recovery directive, hammered out in Strasbourg overnight, bond holders and large depositors would be in the firing line for losses from the start of 2016 -- earlier than planned (although it already happened in Cyprus this spring). National authorities will establish resolution funds or introduce corresponding levies under the plan, which could be tapped if a bank failed. Governments could still launch bailouts, though, under certain circumstances and with EU approval. EU commissioner Michel Barnier has declared that the plan is a major step towards full banking union, giving authorities the power to \"intervene decisively both before problems occur and early on in the process if they do\". In a statement, Barnier said: This law, which applies to all 28 Member States, is an essential piece of the financial regulatory framework that we are building piece by piece for all banks of the European Union in order to draw the lessons from the crisis. Ensuring that failing banks can be wound down in a predictable and efficient way with minimum recourse to public money is fundamental to restoring confidence in Europe's financial sector. The Single Resolution Mechanism, once in place, will be the authority applying these new rules in the context of the Banking Union. With these new rules in place, massive public bail-outs of banks and their consequences for taxpayers will finally be a practice of the past. More to follow! In the UK, former City minister Lord Myners has agreed to join the board of the troubled Co-op Group, for a \u00a31 salary. Myners will run the governance review into what went wrong at the co-operative's banking operation, which has suffered a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall and the humiliation heaped on former chairman Paul Flowers. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: The bank said Myners, a financial services minister under the previous Labour government and a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer and Guardian Media Group, has joined the board with immediate effect as senior independent director and will oversee the bank's governance review. His appointment comes as the bank attempts to move on from allegations of drugs use by its disgraced former chairman Paul Flowers, a 63-year-old Methodist minister. Former City minister Myners joins Co-op Group board on \u00a31 salary Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, confirms that tapering fears are hitting shares this morning, after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8% last night. Van Dulken said there are: Persistent fears of an early tapering of the US Fed\u2019s QE3 stimulus programme next week, derived from better US macro data and the likelihood of a US budget deal avoiding another government shutdown Pointing also to: Speculation of musical chairs at the Fed, with talk that Stanley Fischer, who famously took the top job at the Israeli central bank and successfully helped the country through the crisis, could replace promoted Janet Yellen\u2019s vice chair position. Also note chatter of Bernanke stepping down next week (6-weeks early), if successor Yellen gained full Senate approval, allowing her to chair the December FOMC meeting. Why though? What\u2019s the rush? FOMC* planning to taper and he doesn\u2019t want to be the one to kick it off, leaving that for incoming Yellen? * - that's the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US monetary policy European stock markets have fallen in early trading, following Asia's lead, as the prospect of the Federal Reserve slowing its bond-buying programme soon looms over trading floors. The FTSE 100 is down 22 points, or 0.35%, while Germany's DAX has lost 0.5%, and Italy's FTSE MIB is off 0.4%. Not big moves, but part of a general trend - the FTSE 100 has lost 2% in December, rather than staging one of its traditional \"Santa Rallies\". Slovenian prime minister Alenka Bratusek has convened her cabinet in Ljubljana to tell minister the cost of recapitalising the country's banking sector. A press conference is expected this morning - perhaps at 10am GMT. Analysts have spend months calculating how much money needs to be pumped into the country's mainly state-owned banks to cover their bad debts. Figure of up to \u20ac5bn have been floated -- if it's much higher, there will be fears that Slovenia will need a bailout. Yesterday, the Slovenian central bank insisted that the recapitalisation bill could be paid swiftly, from existing bank provisions and money set aside by the government. Bratusek's government already has parliamentary permission for a recapitalisation of up to \u20ac4.7bn However, here are concerns that Slovenia will struggle to avoid seeking international help. Reuters has published a good backgrounder - here's a flavour: Analysts...fear a quick fix may only delay the inevitable \u2013 Slovenia is expected to remain in recession until 2015, while the banks, many of them state-owned, write down bad debts and sell their stakes in companies from newspapers to supermarkets. \"A lot of Slovenian companies have staff who are not working and getting paid - most of those are going to get fired after privatisation,\" said Saso Stanovnik, an economist at Slovenian brokerage Alta, referring to the likely sell-off of bank holdings. \"In the long term that will be beneficial as the workers are unproductive. In the short term it's going to generate a lot of unemployment and a lot of unhappiness. \"Forecasts suggest the stress tests may reveal a hole of 4 billion to 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion to $6.9 billion), a sum the government believes it can raise through its own cash reserves of 3.6 billion euros, by burning junior bondholders for some 500 million euros and, if necessary, tapping financial markets. Slovenian daily Vecer, citing sources, said the figure would come in at \u20ac3.5-\u20ac3.9bn, of which \u20ac2.9bn would go immediately to the top three lenders, Nova Ljubljanska Banka, Nova KBM and Abanka. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The Christmas party season has barely begun, but financial markets are already fretting that the punch bowl of easy American monetary policy is about to be drained in the new year, or possibly even next week. Asian stock markets have fallen to a two and a half-month low overnight, on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is ready to start winding back its $85bn/month bond-buying stimulus programme. With a US budget deal on the table of Capitol Hill that will boost spending in 2014, the Fed may conclude that there's less for it to keep its policy so loose. Rumours that former Bank of Israel deputy governor Stanley Fischer is line to become Fed deputy chair are also hitting shares - Fischer's seen as relatively hawkish. The main Asian markets are all in the red, with Japan's Nikkei dropping over 1%... ....while in the currency market the Indonesian rupiah fell to a five year low. Analysts aren't sure whether Fed policymakers will puncture the Christmas spirit next week, or save the hangover until the new year. As Reuters explains: \"Following Friday's employment report, we noted that the odds of tapering at the January FOMC meeting (vs. March) had shifted from less than even to roughly even,\" Societe Generale said in a note. \"In light of the budget deal agreed by Congressional dealers in recent days, the odds have shifted further and we now see the January meeting as the most likely timeframe. \"Market participants will also be keeping an eye out for the possibility of a surprise move by the Fed next week at its final policy meeting for 2013 on Dec. 17 and 18. European market are also expected to drop by around 0.5% when trading begins shortly. Also coming up...... \u2022 the Slovenian government could announce the bill for cleaning up its banks today, which will show whether or not it needs some form of bailout. \u2022 George Osborne, UK chancellor, will be appearing before the Treasury Committee of parliament from 10am to discuss last week's autumn statement \u2022 and we'll be watching Italy, where the wave of 'Pitchforks protests' this week have shown the depths of public opposition to the government: I'll be tracking the main developments through the day:",

      "bodyText": "On Britain's high streets, economic recovery can sometimes seem as mythical as the elves whose jobs depend on it. But the shopkeepers of Deal in Kent at least sense a change in atmosphere from the low point of last year. Ralph Cade, owner of the independent gift shop, Greencades, said: \"There were definitely people that started much earlier in November. I think a lot of people are spreading the cost because money is tight.\" At least he is not seeing a repeat of last year's war of nerves as shoppers waited for last minute discounts. \"We'd usually be taking \u00a3400-500 a day in December and [in 2012] it dropped down to \u00a3150-160.\" Then, two days before Christmas there was a sudden rush. \"By that point it was too late to catch up on what we'd lost.\" This year, it wasn't just the shoppers who started early. Independent shops and smaller chain stores participated in the seaside town's first collective late night opening at the end of November. At a time of rising overheads no retailer can take the chance of another depressed Christmas. In addition to online competition, small businesses in Deal compete with high street giants such as Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith and Boots. The town has felt a relatively low impact from supermarkets with only a mid-size Sainsburys and Co-op just beyond the main shopping streets. There is also increasing competition from bargain retailers: Poundland now stands where once there was a Woolworths, and half a dozen charity shops have replaced other chains in the last two years. Half an hour away, the multiple retail parks of Thanet offer mega-branches of Primark, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco. Canterbury boasts a department store and a high street many times bigger. Less than an hour beyond that lie Lakeside, a self-contained mall, and Bluewater, Europe's largest shopping centre. That helps explain why Greencades has decided to close next year. Cade says: \"I've become like Scrooge really, how I run my business.\" In response the Deal Town Team \u2013 a voluntary group of independent retailers, self-formed after Mary Portas's review into the future of our high streets \u2013 organised for the high street to stay open until 8pm for one evening and hand out mince pies and mulled wine to the accompaniment of dancing and singing frorm local youth groups. Despite attracting a big crowd for the choir, the event failed to inspire much actual shopping. \"I was really surprised that we didn't have more people come out,\" said Cade, himself a member of the town team. \"You do all the things you think you're supposed to do \u2013 put an advert in the local paper, put posters up around the town. The town team spent a lot of time trying to get everyone involved \u2013visiting shops, tweeting, Facebooking.\" Cade was frustrated that bigger towns, their department stores offering complimentary champagne and huge discounts, had \"hijacked a community tradition\". Esme Chilton, owner of nearby grocery-cum-cafe, Allotment, said the event embodied the Town Team's mission statement: getting people to interact with their high street and value it as an integral part of their community. In an online age, she said, \"high street shops are no longer the only option\".Late night shopping made sense precisely because \"people want something a bit different, a bit extra\" from their Christmas shopping trip. The high street is about a mile long, with a pedestrianised zone to the south, populated mostly by chain stores, and a north end dotted with independent shops and eateries. Emma Ford, the owner of the Tamarisk clothes store, said: \"My shop is probably the high end of budget. It's not expensive ... A party dress doesn't really ever go beyond \u00a370.\" Ford offers late-night shopping once a quarter. She focuses on \"making sure you personally know your customer and making the effort to make them feel special \u2026 [Then] there's a massive amount of goodwill and they spend an awful lot of money.\" She took \u00a3300 during the town team's late night opening. Then again, two weeks earlier, she \"took \u00a33,000 in two hours at my shopping evening\". Further south down the high street, the women's clothes shop, M&amp;Co., took nothing during late night opening.\"The high street is getting smaller and smaller,\" says manager Sue Hewins. \"We've already lost a few bigger shops and they're just being replaced by independents, which is great, but people need to support the bigger shops as well to keep us here.\" Earlier this month Deal joined in with \"Small Business Saturday\" - a national day for consumers to support small, independent businesses. Locally, it was also a day of free parking \u2013 one of Portas' key recommendations. For their part, many shopkeepers are certain that this is crucial to their survival. But shoppers showed less enthusiasm for Small Business Saturday, or at least for its fundamental message \u2013 converting browsers into buyers. \"People's perception of your business is far from the reality,\" said Cade. \"All the time that people see nice shops and they see that you're open, they think that you're doing all right.\" In fact, Cade says, his takings were 33% down on the same day last year. Deal's record and sports shops are recent victims of the downturn. But there are reasons for hope - the bicycle shop, Curwen's, and fishmongers, Jenkin's, maintain a healthy trade at the same scale as those that have not endured. Despite the challenge they face as retailers, Cade and Chilton maintain a strong belief in the high street as the foundation of strong local community. Portas continues to campaign for her regeneration plans to be implemented nationwide, and last week came a sign that this town team is in-step with its spiritual leader. Deal was shortlisted as one of ten British high streets competing to be named \"High Street of the Year\" by Portas. The challenge for a small cohort of volunteers organising ambitious events such as a late night Christmas shop then, is not a lack of passion from them or the community. Like many grassroots initiatives in hard times, they more often lack time and people power. Cade said that when they launched \"we really thought that we could make a difference. We thought \u2026 \" Chilton finishes his sentence, \"... other people would get involved.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2013. It originally referred to a nearby mall as Lakeland. It is called Lakeside. This has been corrected.",

I think a lot of people are spreading the cost because money is tight.\"</p> <p>At least he is not seeing a repeat of last year's war of nerves as shoppers waited for last minute discounts. \"We'd usually be taking \u00a3400-500 a day in December and [in 2012] it dropped down to \u00a3150-160.\" Then, two days before Christmas there was a sudden rush. \"By that point it was too late to catch up on what we'd lost.\"</p> <p>This year, it wasn't just the shoppers who started early. Independent shops and smaller chain stores participated in the seaside town's first collective late night opening at the end of November. At a time of rising overheads no retailer can take the chance of another depressed Christmas.</p> <p>In addition to online competition, small businesses in Deal compete with high street giants such as Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith and Boots.</p> <p>The town has felt a relatively low impact from supermarkets with only a mid-size Sainsburys and Co-op just beyond the main shopping streets.</p> <p>There is also increasing competition from bargain retailers: Poundland now stands where once there was a Woolworths, and half a dozen charity shops have replaced other chains in the last two years.</p> <p>Half an hour away, the multiple retail parks of Thanet offer mega-branches of Primark, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco. Canterbury boasts a department store and a high street many times bigger. Less than an hour beyond that lie Lakeside, a self-contained mall, and Bluewater, Europe's largest shopping centre.</p> <p>That helps explain why Greencades has decided to close next year. Cade says: \"I've become like Scrooge really, how I run my business.\"</p> <p>In response the Deal Town Team \u2013 a voluntary group of independent retailers, self-formed after Mary Portas's review into the future of our high streets \u2013 organised for the high street to stay open until 8pm for one evening and hand out mince pies and mulled wine to the accompaniment of dancing and singing frorm local youth groups.</p> <p>Despite attracting a big crowd for the choir, the event failed to inspire much actual shopping. \"I was really surprised that we didn't have more people come out,\" said Cade, himself a member of the town team. \"You do all the things you think you're supposed to do \u2013 put an advert in the local paper, put posters up around the town. The town team spent a lot of time trying to get everyone involved \u2013visiting shops, tweeting, Facebooking.\"</p> <p>Cade was frustrated that bigger towns, their department stores offering complimentary champagne and huge discounts, had \"hijacked a community tradition\".</p> <p>Esme Chilton, owner of nearby grocery-cum-cafe, Allotment, said the event embodied the Town Team's mission statement: getting people to interact with their high street and value it as an integral part of their community. In an online age, she said, \"high street shops are no longer the only option\".Late night shopping made sense precisely because \"people want something a bit different, a bit extra\" from their Christmas shopping trip.</p> <p>The high street is about a mile long, with a pedestrianised zone to the south, populated mostly by chain stores, and a north end dotted with independent shops and eateries. Emma Ford, the owner of the Tamarisk clothes store, said: \"My shop is probably the high end of budget. It's not expensive ... A party dress doesn't really ever go beyond \u00a370.\" Ford offers late-night shopping once a quarter. She focuses on \"making sure you personally know your customer and making the effort to make them feel special \u2026 [Then] there's a massive amount of goodwill and they spend an awful lot of money.\"</p> <p>She took \u00a3300 during the town team's late night opening. Then again, two weeks earlier, she \"took \u00a33,000 in two hours at my shopping evening\".</p> <p>Further south down the high street, the women's clothes shop, M&amp;Co., took nothing during late night opening.\"The high street is getting smaller and smaller,\" says manager Sue Hewins. \"We've already lost a few bigger shops and they're just being replaced by independents, which is great, but people need to support the bigger shops as well to keep us here.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month Deal joined in with \"Small Business Saturday\" - a national day for consumers to support small, independent businesses. Locally, it was also a day of free parking \u2013 one of Portas' key recommendations. For their part, many shopkeepers are certain that this is crucial to their survival. But shoppers showed less enthusiasm for Small Business Saturday, or at least for its fundamental message \u2013 converting browsers into buyers. \"People's perception of your business is far from the reality,\" said Cade. \"All the time that people see nice shops and they see that you're open, they think that you're doing all right.\" In fact, Cade says, his takings were 33% down on the same day last year.</p> <p>Deal's record and sports shops are recent victims of the downturn. But there are reasons for hope - the bicycle shop, Curwen's, and fishmongers, Jenkin's, maintain a healthy trade at the same scale as those that have not endured.</p> <p>Despite the challenge they face as retailers, Cade and Chilton maintain a strong belief in the high street as the foundation of strong local community. Portas continues to campaign for her regeneration plans to be implemented nationwide, and last week came a sign that this town team is in-step with its spiritual leader. Deal was shortlisted as one of ten British high streets competing to be named \"High Street of the Year\" by Portas.</p> <p>The challenge for a small cohort of volunteers organising ambitious events such as a late night Christmas shop then, is not a lack of passion from them or the community. Like many grassroots initiatives in hard times, they more often lack time and people power. Cade said that when they launched \"we really thought that we could make a difference. We thought \u2026 \" Chilton finishes his sentence, \"... other people would get involved.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2013. It originally referred to a nearby mall as Lakeland. It is called Lakeside. This has been corrected.</p>",

B&amp;B was eventually nationalised in September 2008.</p> <p>Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of financial crime and enforcement, said:</p> <p>\"Willford failed to identify and investigate potentially material risks, or alert the board, at a crucial time for the firm. His conduct fell short of the FCA's standards \u2013 senior managers should expect the FCA to take action if they fail to show due skill, care and diligence.\"</p> <p>The FCA set out eight mitigating factors against Willford's failures to inform the board that he had received information showing that the bank's profits were lower than expected and its bad debt provisions almost twice as large as had been expected. Among them was the illness of the chief executive, Steven Crawshaw, who eventually stepped aside on 1 June 2008 citing poor health.</p> <p>But the FCA found that over the weekend of Friday 16 May to Monday 19, Willford had received information showing that the bank was likely to miss its profits expectations but had failed to analyse the information closely enough or passed on the information to the board.</p> <p>It was a \"short but intensely busy period of time\", the FCA said. It stressed that Willford's actions could not be blamed for a profits warning that took place on 2 June 2008, the collapse of the rights issue or its nationalisation in September 2008.</p> <p>\"The size of the fine reflects the length and timing of the misconduct, which took place over three days during the height of the financial crisis,\" the FCA added. On 16 May 2008, Willford received information that suggested that B&amp;B's financial outlook might be weaker than expected. \"As B&amp;B was preparing to raise capital through a rights issue, this should have immediately been raised with B&amp;B's board and investigated to ensure that the information provided to shareholders about the rights issue on 19 May was correct,\" the FCA said.</p> <p>He had received the information by email at 8.48am on Friday 16 May which showed figures provided to him were different to a three-year forecast upon which the bank was operating. The estimated mortgage impairment charge for the first four months in 2008 was \u00a335.7m \u2013 already 63% of the forecast yearly impairment charge in the three-year plan \u2013 while total arrears over three months and possessions was rising and net interest margin, a gauge of profitability, had fallen sharply between March and April. In addition, a new forecast for underlying profit before tax showed that the group was going to struggle to achieve a forecast of \u00a3254m for full-year profits.</p> <p>By 4.17pm he had received another email from the finance team showing that full-year impairment forecast was \u00a3106m \u2013 \u00a349.5m more than the forecast in the three-year plan.</p> <p>\"Together, the draft April 2008 group results pack and the mortgage impairment paper indicated a possible material change in BBG's financial outlook. A decision on whether a material deterioration had in fact occurred was a decision for BBG's board. However, Mr Willford failed formally and urgently to escalate the information available to him, so that the board could consider it before the circular was formally approved on 19 May 2008,\" the FCA said.</p> <p>Willford could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>",

His conduct fell short of the FCA's standards \u2013 senior managers should expect the FCA to take action if they fail to show due skill, care and diligence.\" The FCA set out eight mitigating factors against Willford's failures to inform the board that he had received information showing that the bank's profits were lower than expected and its bad debt provisions almost twice as large as had been expected. Among them was the illness of the chief executive, Steven Crawshaw, who eventually stepped aside on 1 June 2008 citing poor health. But the FCA found that over the weekend of Friday 16 May to Monday 19, Willford had received information showing that the bank was likely to miss its profits expectations but had failed to analyse the information closely enough or passed on the information to the board. It was a \"short but intensely busy period of time\", the FCA said. It stressed that Willford's actions could not be blamed for a profits warning that took place on 2 June 2008, the collapse of the rights issue or its nationalisation in September 2008. \"The size of the fine reflects the length and timing of the misconduct, which took place over three days during the height of the financial crisis,\" the FCA added. On 16 May 2008, Willford received information that suggested that B&amp;B's financial outlook might be weaker than expected. \"As B&amp;B was preparing to raise capital through a rights issue, this should have immediately been raised with B&amp;B's board and investigated to ensure that the information provided to shareholders about the rights issue on 19 May was correct,\" the FCA said. He had received the information by email at 8.48am on Friday 16 May which showed figures provided to him were different to a three-year forecast upon which the bank was operating. The estimated mortgage impairment charge for the first four months in 2008 was \u00a335.7m \u2013 already 63% of the forecast yearly impairment charge in the three-year plan \u2013 while total arrears over three months and possessions was rising and net interest margin, a gauge of profitability, had fallen sharply between March and April. In addition, a new forecast for underlying profit before tax showed that the group was going to struggle to achieve a forecast of \u00a3254m for full-year profits. By 4.17pm he had received another email from the finance team showing that full-year impairment forecast was \u00a3106m \u2013 \u00a349.5m more than the forecast in the three-year plan. \"Together, the draft April 2008 group results pack and the mortgage impairment paper indicated a possible material change in BBG's financial outlook. A decision on whether a material deterioration had in fact occurred was a decision for BBG's board. However, Mr Willford failed formally and urgently to escalate the information available to him, so that the board could consider it before the circular was formally approved on 19 May 2008,\" the FCA said. Willford could not immediately be reached for comment.",

The ruling by judge Mordy Bromberg poses more questions about Toyota's future as it considers whether it can continue to make cars following the decision by GM Holden to shut its local manufacturing operations by 2017. About 2,500 production workers at Toyota's Altona plant in Melbourne were due to have started voting from midnight on Thursday, as the first shift workers clocked on. The injunction runs until early February, although Toyota might yet decide to appeal the ruling. Toyota has put forward a package of workplace changes which cut some allowances and give greater flexibility in working hours and shifts. It reduces overall pay but would still allow two scheduled increases to base pay. The car maker says the package would give annual savings of about $17m. It aims to cut the cost of of its Australian made cars by $3,800 by 2018. A small group of Toyota shop stewards and workers sought the injunction, arguing that the existing workplace agreement at Toyota's Altona plant included a clause which said \"no further claims\" could be made during the life of the agreement. The judge ruled that Toyota was making extra claims to vary wages and employment conditions and that this was in breach of the Fair Work Act. He said that Toyota management could still seek to remove the clause prohibiting extra claims during the life of the agreement. This would allow the company to then seek approval from the workforce for the original package of changes, but this two-step process would take months to complete. Car industry unions have said they are willing to have further discussions on workplace change but have complained that Toyota has not consulted with them. The federal and Victorian governments are likely to criticise the legal action, as they seek to retain Toyota as Australia's last car manufacturer. Toyota Australia President and CEO Max Yasuda said he was disappointed with the ruling. \u201cWe believe that we are within our rights to vary our workplace agreement provided the majority of our employees support the changes through a formal vote,\u201d Yasuda said. \u201cThe company is doing everything that it can to secure the future for our employees and their families. \u201cGM Holden\u2019s planned closure in 2017 will put our manufacturing operations and the local supplier network under unprecedented pressure, so it is now more important than ever before that we make urgent changes. \u201cA decision will be made next year on the next generation Camry and export program and we need to take urgent action if we want to stay at the negotiating table for future investments. \u201cThe proposed changes were designed to remove outdated and uncompetitive terms and conditions that make it difficult to compete with other Toyota plants throughout the world.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Holden is one of the world's oldest transport brands, being established by James Alexander Holden as an Adelaide saddlery business in 1856 before going into coach building.</p> <p>The family business shifted into the new form of horsepower from 1908 and began large-scale local production of car bodies for General Motors of the US in 1917. Its famous emblem of a lion rolling a stone was an art deco-style fable of man inventing the wheel, even though the symbolism was possibly lost on later generations of petrol heads.</p> <p>Holden has been owned by General Motors of the US since 1931 but has retained its image of Australianness to the end. Maybe it came from Holden being the first company to mass-produce a car in Australia in 1948, at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. The then prime minister, Ben Chifley, was on hand to exclaim: \"She's a beauty!\" even though the first model, the FX, was in fact rather bulbous and plain apart from a shark-toothed chrome grille at the front.</p> <p>The early Holdens came amid the rapid growth of suburbia after the second world war and local car production was fostered by bipartisan policies of protectionism for strategic local industries.</p> <p>Other Holden models drove into Australian folklore. The FJ was the subject and title of a 1977 film about young men in Bankstown in western Sydney. Australian boys, and many girls, could tell the difference between an EH or an EJ, along with the HR and HD. A book explored the social history of the Kingswood (Up for Rego, by Richard Strauss), which also supplied the name for a homegrown sitcom. There were epic racetrack battles at Bathurst between the late driving legend Peter Brock and Alan Moffatt in a Falcon.</p> <p>Customised panel vans such as the Sandman were turned into fetish symbols and their \"meaning\" was later studied in the era of pop semiotics. But the Puberty Blues surfie generation was more blunt, dubbing them shaggin' wagons, and the vans sometimes had a sticker that warned passersby not to bother knocking if they were rocking.</p> <p>Then there was the Torana, which started out as a skinny little thing, but muscled up. There was the Monaro, which was always a big fast-back bruiser. And there was the Commodore, a workhorse which was first produced in 1978 and went on to be Australia's best-selling car for 15 years in row.</p> <p>But the evolution of the Commodore also pointed to the reasons for the eventual demise of Holden as a local manufacturer. The quality of the Commodore improved markedly but the 2006 VE model \u2013 the first designed wholly in Australia \u2013 reportedly cost more than $1bn to develop.</p> <p>The Commodore and the Falcon (produced by its great rival, Ford) were \"orphans\" \u2013 cars that were mostly developed and sold in a single country. The big car makers switched to so-called \"global platforms\" (essentially everything under the body skin such as the chassis, engine and transmission). These global platforms could underpin the production of multiple models and the development costs could be shared.</p> <p>For a while, Holden did well with exports of the Commodore to the US, where it was rebadged as a Pontiac. But the global financial crisis and the costs of retiree health schemes in the US almost sank the parent company, General Motors, and a cull of its US brands included the Pontiac.</p> <p>The woes of GM were a reminder that, while Holden and Ford were big wheels in Australia, they were small, branch offices of huge, multinational corporations. Head office in Detroit dictated the local production lineup up and the Australian chiefs of Holden and Ford were typically shifted after several years to other roles within the corporate empires.</p> <p>Consumers switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The families who used to buy Commodores and Falcons bought sports utility vehicles instead. The old tariff walls that protected the local producers have now been cut to 5%, while free trade agreements have cut the effective tariff rate to 3.5%. The tariff rate will shrink further after the signing of the FTA with Korea, and other planned trade deals with China and Japan.</p> <p>The local car maker was criticised for not making smaller cars, but big production runs are needed to make a profit. Car plants usually need to have annual output of at least 100,000 cars to be viable and Holden will make about 75,000 this year. The top selling car in Australia last year, the Mazda3, sold 44,128.</p> <p>One reason for this fragmentation is that Australia has one of the most competitive new car markets in the world. For example, China has annual car sales of 28 million (47 makes and 379 models) while Australia has annual sales of 1 million with 51 makes and 344 models.This competition has been compounded by the resources boom pushing the Australian dollar beyond parity with the US. Imports were cheaper and exports dearer.</p> <p>Recession-struck European car makers looked to increase exports to Australia; and, more recently, the devaluation of the yen has pushed down the price of Japanese cars.</p> <p>The car plan introduced in the mid-1980s by Labor\u2019s industry minister John Button sought to force the rationalisation of car makers and the number of models produced through lower tariffs and easing of import quotas. The aim was to improve local vehicles and boost exports as well.</p> <p>As the then treasurer Paul Keating famously noted: \"The shoe is designed to pinch.\" Indeed, and Nissan shut its Melbourne plant in 1991. Mitsubishi shut its Adelaide factory in 2008.</p> <p>Yet Australia still has very advanced automotive skills, being one of only a dozen or so countries which can design a modern car from the ground up and then build it. Holden, Ford and Toyota all have advanced research and design centres in Australia, but these operations are usually located alongside manufacturing plants. Ford has said it will keep this work in Australia \u2013 which employs about 1100 engineers and designers \u2013 but it needs to have access to industry assistance which is now limited to car makers.</p> <p>One of the advisers who worked on the Button plant, Nick Gruen, has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2013/s3909354.htm%20\">argued that Australia should look to China and India</a> to develop the auto know-how that Detroit and Tokyo were unable (or unwilling) to fully utilise. A London-based author and consultant, John Wormald, has cited the Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover as a possible model (Chinese interests now own the collapsed Volvo group).</p> <p>A journalist who has specialised in manufacturing, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Going-going-gone-list-industries-3852111.S.5816627076437917698?trk=groups%2Finclude%2Fitem_snippet-0-b-ttl\">Peter Roberts</a>, has argued that globalisation has delivered Australia an industry that suits the needs of foreign capital, rather than the nation. \"The end-game is a de-industrialised country reliant on finance, services industries and resources extraction.\" Academic <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2013/s3909773.htm\">Roy Green</a> has called an end to the blame game and to get on with a new strategy for manufacturing in the 21st century.</p> <p>However there remains a lot of emotion swirling around the end of Holden. Its cars helped give many Australians mobility, when petrol was cheaper and times seemed freer. Its demise is an economic and political milestone, but a psychological one as well.</p>",

Holden has been owned by General Motors of the US since 1931 but has retained its image of Australianness to the end. Maybe it came from Holden being the first company to mass-produce a car in Australia in 1948, at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. The then prime minister, Ben Chifley, was on hand to exclaim: \"She's a beauty!\" even though the first model, the FX, was in fact rather bulbous and plain apart from a shark-toothed chrome grille at the front. The early Holdens came amid the rapid growth of suburbia after the second world war and local car production was fostered by bipartisan policies of protectionism for strategic local industries. Other Holden models drove into Australian folklore. The FJ was the subject and title of a 1977 film about young men in Bankstown in western Sydney. Australian boys, and many girls, could tell the difference between an EH or an EJ, along with the HR and HD. A book explored the social history of the Kingswood (Up for Rego, by Richard Strauss), which also supplied the name for a homegrown sitcom. There were epic racetrack battles at Bathurst between the late driving legend Peter Brock and Alan Moffatt in a Falcon. Customised panel vans such as the Sandman were turned into fetish symbols and their \"meaning\" was later studied in the era of pop semiotics. But the Puberty Blues surfie generation was more blunt, dubbing them shaggin' wagons, and the vans sometimes had a sticker that warned passersby not to bother knocking if they were rocking. Then there was the Torana, which started out as a skinny little thing, but muscled up. There was the Monaro, which was always a big fast-back bruiser. And there was the Commodore, a workhorse which was first produced in 1978 and went on to be Australia's best-selling car for 15 years in row. But the evolution of the Commodore also pointed to the reasons for the eventual demise of Holden as a local manufacturer. The quality of the Commodore improved markedly but the 2006 VE model \u2013 the first designed wholly in Australia \u2013 reportedly cost more than $1bn to develop. The Commodore and the Falcon (produced by its great rival, Ford) were \"orphans\" \u2013 cars that were mostly developed and sold in a single country. The big car makers switched to so-called \"global platforms\" (essentially everything under the body skin such as the chassis, engine and transmission). These global platforms could underpin the production of multiple models and the development costs could be shared. For a while, Holden did well with exports of the Commodore to the US, where it was rebadged as a Pontiac. But the global financial crisis and the costs of retiree health schemes in the US almost sank the parent company, General Motors, and a cull of its US brands included the Pontiac. The woes of GM were a reminder that, while Holden and Ford were big wheels in Australia, they were small, branch offices of huge, multinational corporations. Head office in Detroit dictated the local production lineup up and the Australian chiefs of Holden and Ford were typically shifted after several years to other roles within the corporate empires. Consumers switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The families who used to buy Commodores and Falcons bought sports utility vehicles instead. The old tariff walls that protected the local producers have now been cut to 5%, while free trade agreements have cut the effective tariff rate to 3.5%. The tariff rate will shrink further after the signing of the FTA with Korea, and other planned trade deals with China and Japan. The local car maker was criticised for not making smaller cars, but big production runs are needed to make a profit. Car plants usually need to have annual output of at least 100,000 cars to be viable and Holden will make about 75,000 this year. The top selling car in Australia last year, the Mazda3, sold 44,128. One reason for this fragmentation is that Australia has one of the most competitive new car markets in the world. For example, China has annual car sales of 28 million (47 makes and 379 models) while Australia has annual sales of 1 million with 51 makes and 344 models.This competition has been compounded by the resources boom pushing the Australian dollar beyond parity with the US. Imports were cheaper and exports dearer. Recession-struck European car makers looked to increase exports to Australia; and, more recently, the devaluation of the yen has pushed down the price of Japanese cars. The car plan introduced in the mid-1980s by Labor\u2019s industry minister John Button sought to force the rationalisation of car makers and the number of models produced through lower tariffs and easing of import quotas. The aim was to improve local vehicles and boost exports as well. As the then treasurer Paul Keating famously noted: \"The shoe is designed to pinch.\" Indeed, and Nissan shut its Melbourne plant in 1991. Mitsubishi shut its Adelaide factory in 2008. Yet Australia still has very advanced automotive skills, being one of only a dozen or so countries which can design a modern car from the ground up and then build it. Holden, Ford and Toyota all have advanced research and design centres in Australia, but these operations are usually located alongside manufacturing plants. Ford has said it will keep this work in Australia \u2013 which employs about 1100 engineers and designers \u2013 but it needs to have access to industry assistance which is now limited to car makers. One of the advisers who worked on the Button plant, Nick Gruen, has argued that Australia should look to China and India to develop the auto know-how that Detroit and Tokyo were unable (or unwilling) to fully utilise. A London-based author and consultant, John Wormald, has cited the Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover as a possible model (Chinese interests now own the collapsed Volvo group). A journalist who has specialised in manufacturing, Peter Roberts, has argued that globalisation has delivered Australia an industry that suits the needs of foreign capital, rather than the nation. \"The end-game is a de-industrialised country reliant on finance, services industries and resources extraction.\" Academic Roy Green has called an end to the blame game and to get on with a new strategy for manufacturing in the 21st century. However there remains a lot of emotion swirling around the end of Holden. Its cars helped give many Australians mobility, when petrol was cheaper and times seemed freer. Its demise is an economic and political milestone, but a psychological one as well.",

The Productivity Commission each year reviews<a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/annual-reports/trade-assistance\"> the assistance for each industry</a>, splitting it into two main categories \u2013 tariffs and budgetary.</p> <p>The assistance through tariffs is indirect and not a budgetary cost. They allow producers to raise the cost of their product because tariffs add to the price charged by their overseas competitors. Tariffs also raise the cost of imports for local producers so they can have a net negative assistance \u2013 as is the case for much of the services sector.</p> <p>But the big issue this week has been budgetary assistance. This is also divided into two sections. The first is direct outlays \u2013 actual money in the budget spent on companies and industries, which adds to the deficit (and debt).</p> <p>The second category is tax concessions. These also cost the budget through tax revenue foregone. They are generally less well known because the direct outlays make for much better publicity for politicians as they turn up at a factory and hand out some cash. For example, during the election campaign Tony Abbott visited the Cadbury factory in Tasmania<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-28/tony-abbott-promises-upgrades-at-cadbury/4917616\"> to pledge $16m in direct assistance</a>. Tax concessions are by their nature more dispersed and less easy to sell as a specific benefit to any particular company.</p> <p>The Productivity Commission found that in 2011-12 the industry that received the most total budgetary assistance was manufacturing with $1.65bn, followed by the primary agriculture industry with $1.44bn and then the electricity, water and gas industry with $1.08bn.</p> <p>The electricity, water and gas industry mostly received assistance under the<a href=\"http://www.ret.gov.au/ENERGY/ENERGY_SECURITY/FUND/Pages/fund.aspx\"> energy security fund</a> to cope with the introduction of the carbon price. The manufacturing and agricultural industry had a number of types of assistance and the Productivity Commission breaks down those industries to give a clearer picture of where the money is going:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/epKdP/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On this breakdown we see that the motor vehicle industry ranks fourth in level of assistance received. Most of its assistance came through direct outlays via the automotive transformation scheme ($381m) and the green car innovation fund ($125m).</p> <p>The mining sector\u2019s $700m of assistance mostly came in the form of the<a href=\"http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/clean/ctap/csjp/Pages/CoalSectorJobsPackage.aspx\"> coal sector jobs package</a>, to assist with the introduction of the carbon price ($218m) and research and development tax concessions.</p> <p>But while these nominal amounts show how much of taxpayers\u2019 money is going to various sectors, the Productivity Commission calculates the effective level of assistance by contrasting each industry\u2019s nominal assistance with the value of the industry\u2019s output. Clearly if the government gives $1bn to an industry with a $100bn output it is less dependent on that assistance than an industry with a $5bn output.</p> <p>This measure shows the importance of government assistance to the car industry (although the list is incomplete because they don\u2019t publish effective rates for the services industries or including the electricity, gas and water, and construction industries):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/D9jaI/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The motor vehicle and parts industry is clearly the most dependent upon government assistance; whereas the mining industry, which received $80m more in nominal assistance, was scarcely dependent upon it. The manufacturing industry as a whole had an effective assistance rate of 4.1%.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth, however, getting some context to the assistance to the manufacturing industry. While in the 1970s and 1980s it was massively supported \u2013 at the time worth over a quarter of its output, since 1990 its effective support has been on a par with that other great Australian industry, agriculture:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/2c8y1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Also, while the Productivity Commission does consider tax concessions as assistance it only includes those which are industry or sector specific. This means it does not, for example, include as an assistance the<a href=\"http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/environment/fuel_tax_credit/\"> fuel tax credit scheme</a>, which allows companies to claim a tax credit for the use of diesel fuel in heavy road vehicles.</p> <p>And yet assist the mining industry it does \u2013 to the tune of $2.3bn in 2011-12, compared to only $182m for the manufacturing industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Sftna/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>One other tax concession not counted by the Productivity Commission is negative gearing. This certainly provides assistance given in 2010-11 negative gearing investors claimed $13bn in losses in their tax. Such investors were claiming an average loss on their property of $10,947.</p> <p>The ability to claim negative gearing assists the investment property market. For all the talk of a housing boom in recent months, it is worth noting that over the past two years the value of investment housing loans has vastly outstripped that for owner-occupiers. The more than 45% increase in value of investment housing loans is as big as anything seen since the early 2000s housing boom, while the growth in owner-occupier home loans remains below levels seen in 2007.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/rFIni/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly, tax concessions via GST exemptions are not counted as assistance although you could argue, for example, that the $3.5bn foregone each year through education expenses being GST exempt is a massive assistance to the private education sector.</p> <p>You could also argue that the $30bn in taxation foregone due to concessional treatment of superannuation contributions and earnings is a massive boon for the financial services industry. But that also is not included as official \u201cassistance\u201d.</p> <p>So yes, the car industry receives assistance and it is understandable why some are glad to see it will end. But there are plenty of industry fingers in the government pie. And it is worth acknowledging that the reason much of the assistance like the fuel tax concessions or negative gearing remains in place \u2013 or remains at its current level \u2013 has little to do with economics and more to do with political lobbying.</p>",

But the big issue this week has been budgetary assistance. This is also divided into two sections. The first is direct outlays \u2013 actual money in the budget spent on companies and industries, which adds to the deficit (and debt). The second category is tax concessions. These also cost the budget through tax revenue foregone. They are generally less well known because the direct outlays make for much better publicity for politicians as they turn up at a factory and hand out some cash. For example, during the election campaign Tony Abbott visited the Cadbury factory in Tasmania to pledge $16m in direct assistance. Tax concessions are by their nature more dispersed and less easy to sell as a specific benefit to any particular company. The Productivity Commission found that in 2011-12 the industry that received the most total budgetary assistance was manufacturing with $1.65bn, followed by the primary agriculture industry with $1.44bn and then the electricity, water and gas industry with $1.08bn. The electricity, water and gas industry mostly received assistance under the energy security fund to cope with the introduction of the carbon price. The manufacturing and agricultural industry had a number of types of assistance and the Productivity Commission breaks down those industries to give a clearer picture of where the money is going: On this breakdown we see that the motor vehicle industry ranks fourth in level of assistance received. Most of its assistance came through direct outlays via the automotive transformation scheme ($381m) and the green car innovation fund ($125m). The mining sector\u2019s $700m of assistance mostly came in the form of the coal sector jobs package, to assist with the introduction of the carbon price ($218m) and research and development tax concessions. But while these nominal amounts show how much of taxpayers\u2019 money is going to various sectors, the Productivity Commission calculates the effective level of assistance by contrasting each industry\u2019s nominal assistance with the value of the industry\u2019s output. Clearly if the government gives $1bn to an industry with a $100bn output it is less dependent on that assistance than an industry with a $5bn output. This measure shows the importance of government assistance to the car industry (although the list is incomplete because they don\u2019t publish effective rates for the services industries or including the electricity, gas and water, and construction industries): The motor vehicle and parts industry is clearly the most dependent upon government assistance; whereas the mining industry, which received $80m more in nominal assistance, was scarcely dependent upon it. The manufacturing industry as a whole had an effective assistance rate of 4.1%. It\u2019s worth, however, getting some context to the assistance to the manufacturing industry. While in the 1970s and 1980s it was massively supported \u2013 at the time worth over a quarter of its output, since 1990 its effective support has been on a par with that other great Australian industry, agriculture: Also, while the Productivity Commission does consider tax concessions as assistance it only includes those which are industry or sector specific. This means it does not, for example, include as an assistance the fuel tax credit scheme, which allows companies to claim a tax credit for the use of diesel fuel in heavy road vehicles. And yet assist the mining industry it does \u2013 to the tune of $2.3bn in 2011-12, compared to only $182m for the manufacturing industry: One other tax concession not counted by the Productivity Commission is negative gearing. This certainly provides assistance given in 2010-11 negative gearing investors claimed $13bn in losses in their tax. Such investors were claiming an average loss on their property of $10,947. The ability to claim negative gearing assists the investment property market. For all the talk of a housing boom in recent months, it is worth noting that over the past two years the value of investment housing loans has vastly outstripped that for owner-occupiers. The more than 45% increase in value of investment housing loans is as big as anything seen since the early 2000s housing boom, while the growth in owner-occupier home loans remains below levels seen in 2007. Similarly, tax concessions via GST exemptions are not counted as assistance although you could argue, for example, that the $3.5bn foregone each year through education expenses being GST exempt is a massive assistance to the private education sector. You could also argue that the $30bn in taxation foregone due to concessional treatment of superannuation contributions and earnings is a massive boon for the financial services industry. But that also is not included as official \u201cassistance\u201d. So yes, the car industry receives assistance and it is understandable why some are glad to see it will end. But there are plenty of industry fingers in the government pie. And it is worth acknowledging that the reason much of the assistance like the fuel tax concessions or negative gearing remains in place \u2013 or remains at its current level \u2013 has little to do with economics and more to do with political lobbying.",

He also sold one to his wife and a colleague, such was the pressure to meet targets set by the bank between January 2010 and March 2012. His case is used as an example by the Financial Conduct Authority in its record \u00a328m fine against the bailed-out bank to illustrate the problems in the bonus schemes that have been uncovered during an industry-wide review of the sales and bonus culture in the high street banks. The watchdog investigated the incentive and bonus schemes at 22 financial firms last year and uncovered a range of \"serious failings\", the most serious of which were at Lloyds. The three brands inside Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 created when Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS in September 2008 \u2013 operated similar bonus schemes for the 2,000 advisers working across the three branch networks and accumulating points through sales of financial products. The bonus schemes of Lloyds TSB, Bank of Scotland and Halifax were similar but not identical during the period. Among the more eye-catching schemes were \"a grand in the hand\" competition and Christmas hamper competition introduced in the last three months of 2010, which were part of an effort by Lloyds to meet targets to double the customer base by 2015. To qualify for the \"Christmas cracker\" competition and win a food hamper or wine selection, an adviser needed to sell 50 products in the last three months of 2010. An adviser could receive an extra \u00a31,000 in September 2010 if the customers to whom they had previously sold products stayed with the bank. At Lloyds TSB, a successful adviser could take home \"the champagne bonus\", 35% of their monthly salary (\u00a3940 gross for a mid-ranking advisor) for hitting their targets. Lloyds TSB operated a six-tier payscale \u2013 ranging from \u00a318,200 to \u00a372,600 \u2013 and moved staff up and down based on whether they hit a points target. The regime outlined by the FCA was brutal, with staff failing to achieve certain targets at risk of moving down the salary pay scale.

The 33% taxpayer-owned bank now faces a bill of at least \u00a3100m to compensate up to 700,000 customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland who bought \u00a32bn-worth of products such as stocks-and-shares Isas and illness or income insurance cover, between January 2010 and March 2012 in a bonus-induced selling frenzy by staff. The scale of the fine \u2013 a record for the Financial Conduct Authority in such cases \u2013 and the potential bill for redress could result in bonuses for past and current directors being clawed back, including the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who was at the helm for 12 months before the bonus schemes were stopped. Among the revelations are: \u2022 A sales adviser sold financial protection products to himself, his wife and a colleague in an attempt to avoid being demoted. \u2022 A \"grand in your hand\" scheme for advisers at Halifax and Bank of Scotland made one-off payments of \u00a31,000 for hitting sales targets. \u2022 A \"champagne bonus\" was awarded to Lloyds TSB staff, worth 35% of their monthly salary, for meeting sales targets. Exposing the latest failings of an industry already disgraced by the payment protection insurance scandal, Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said the fine had been increased by 10% because Lloyds failed to heed repeated warnings about sales practices and because it had been fined 10 years ago for poor sales incentives. \"Customers have a right to expect better from our leading financial institutions and we expect firms to put customers first \u2013 but firms will never be able to do this if they incentivise their staff to do the opposite,\" said McDermott. The FCA found that in many instances customers did not need the products they were being sold but Lloyds paid bonuses to its staff for selling them, while employees who failed to hit targets faced demotion. Salaries varied by up to \u00a370,000 depending on how much individuals sold. Union officials at Unite called for all sales bonuses to be abolished. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: \"Despite the countless reports and investigations into the conduct of the banks, the industry clearly has not learned the lessons of the financial crisis nor heard the concerns of customers and staff in order to adequately change.\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who recently received a \u00a32.3m share bonus because of the rise in the bank's share price since the government sold off the first tranche of its stake, took the helm of Lloyds in March 2011. He brought in a new management team. Bonuses handed to former directors \u2013 such as Helen Weir, now the finance director of retailer John Lewis, who was head of retail banking for much of the period \u2013 could be clawed back. She \u2013 along with other directors including the former chief executive, Eric Daniels \u2013 could be among those whose outstanding bonuses are under threat, although she is unlikely to have known about the detail of the selling schemes. A spokesman for Lloyds said the impact on bonuses for directors \u2013 past and present \u2013 would be considered at next month's remuneration committee. \"2010 bonus awards for executive directors were made in March 2011 and are deferred over a period of three years. The remuneration committee will re-consider deferred awards if appropriate to do so before being released,\" the bank said. Lloyds said it had already embarked on a review to establish if compensation should be paid to customers. \"We are already contacting customers, and will continue to contact potentially affected customers over the coming months. Customers do not need to take any action at this stage to be included in the review and they will be contacted in due course,\" it added. McDermott said the FCA had published a review of incentive schemes last year and that all firms needed to ensure they were not encouraging staff to sell products customers did not want. \"The review \u2026 makes it quite clear that this is something to which we expect all firms to adhere.\"",
