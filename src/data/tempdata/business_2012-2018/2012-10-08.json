      "bodyText": "Visitor numbers to the UK's top tourist attractions plummeted this year after the wettest summer for 100 years and the disruption of the Olympics, triggering the worst trading period \"in living memory\" for key destinations in London, stark new figures have revealed. Some major London attractions hosted 60% fewer visitors during the two weeks of the Games, the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva) said, while many further afield suffered one of the worst trading periods since foot and mouth disease gripped the British countryside in 2001. Visits to gardens and heritage spots in London were particularly badly hit this summer by the \"appalling weather\", with the amount spent during visits in cafes, restaurants and shops also falling. Among the attractions that suffered a dip in numbers this summer were London Zoo, the Tower of London and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. Alva has 43 members managing some 2,000 tourist sites across the UK and typically welcomes more than 100 million domestic and overseas visitors each year. Overall, those in London saw an average decrease of 15% in visitor numbers in May-August compared with the same period last year. In the capital, gardens and outdoor attractions suffered the largest single decrease of 21.3% in visitor numbers, as heavy rainfall made visitors turn their backs on normally popular destinations such as London Zoo (run by the Zoological Society of London) and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. Retail and catering spend fell by 9.7% and 12.5%. But heritage sites and cathedrals \u2013 including the Tower of London, St Paul's Cathedral and the Houses of Parliament \u2013 were also casualties, with visitors numbers slumping by 20.3% and retail and catering spending by 20.2% and 8.6%. Visitor numbers to museums and galleries in London fell by 13.1%. Bernard Donoghue, chief executive of Alva, said: \"In the first couple of weeks of the Olympics, some of the key central London attractions experienced a huge fall of up to 61% in visitor numbers compared to the same weeks last year. Overseas visitors who stayed away from London during the Olympic period and Londoners who avoided the city led to media headlines of London being described as \"a ghost town\". Donoghue admitted that the figures made \"sobering reading\" and showed that \"the summer of 2012 has been a difficult time financially for our most popular and best-loved visitor attractions. It is our belief that for gardens and outdoor attractions across the UK, the appalling weather during much of the year has led to one of the worst trading periods since 2001 and foot and mouth. For London attractions the Olympic period was one of their worst trading periods in living memory and for visitor attractions the summer is their equivalent of retailers' Christmas; once lost the business can't be won back.\" But Alva said it was now working with local and national tourist boards and others \"to turn the millions of Olympic TV viewers who loved how Britain looked into visitors who will come here in the next months and years\". The figures were published as the government faced accusations that it is continuing \"a deplorable policy of neglect\" towards tourism. The prime minister, David Cameron, had promised upon his election that tourism would be a priority, the editors of the influential Good Hotel Guide said. But Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer, joint editors of the 2013 edition of the guide, said Britain had squandered a \"golden opportunity to develop tourism\" in the year of the Queen's jubilee and the Olympic Games, and the government had slashed the tourism budget by one-fifth.",

One BAE investor, remarking on Invesco's \"surprising\" statement, said: \"The deal already seems to be struggling, without shareholders needing to get involved.\"</p> <p>The UK can block the deal under the terms of its golden share in BAE, while the French and German governments control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings. Talks to resolve the future of the governmental interests in BAE and EADS are running parallel to the corporate process, which suffered a serious stumble with the Invesco intervention.</p> <p>It is not just national security at stake, but tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in each country. In the UK alone, BAE and EADS employ more than 50,000 people.</p> <p>Under the ideal scenario for the UK government, the French and German states would emerge with stakes of 9% each in the merged business. The French media conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re \u2013 a 7.5% shareholder in EADS and another critic of the deal \u2013 would have to sell down its stake in order to ensure that the French state's stake does not creep into double figures. This is an assurance that is being sought by the UK government as well as Berlin. The German interest in EADS is represented by Daimler, the car manufacturer, which would transfer some of its stake to the state-owned KfW in a process that would help create the 9% German shareholding.</p> <p>A source with knowledge of the government talks said they were on a knife-edge. They were pushed closer to the precipice on Friday when German officials used a conference call with their French and UK counterparts to ask for guarantees on the size of the French shareholding and, then, that the headquarters of the combined company would be in Munich. The latter demand shocked all parties, including BAE and EADS, because it was thought the business would be based at the Airbus HQ in Toulouse, with Farnborough in Hampshire as the head office of the defence business. Pushing for Munich, said one source, could collapse the deal.</p> <p>On Monday, the British defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said he wanted France and Germany's interests represented by single-digit stakes. He added: \"We believe for this to work this company has to be allowed to operate as a commercial company, and not as a branch of the French or German government, and that means a reduction in the stakes held by the French and German governments.</p> <p>\"We have made our position clear, so let us see what happens,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking after the latest tripartite discussions on Monday, a UK government source said: \"The talks are continuing.\"</p> <p>In France, some commentary has been critical of the UK's concerns. Last night, Le Monde said the talks were entering a critical period. It said: \"Does the United Kingdom want a written engagement from France or simple assurances that the two countries will not use their shares to influence the decisions of the new company? Nothing is clear cut. London has in any case confirmed, through Hammond, that it will block the deal if France and Germany try to keep their influence over the running of the new group.\"</p> <p>German economic commentators described the merger talks as close to collapse, with political stalemate being cited as the biggest barrier. Germany is fearful of being marginalised because the French and British governments have apparently decided on the terms of a tie-up, sources close to the government said. The subsequent need to redress a perceived imbalance led to the Munich demand.</p> <p>Analysts added that if the merger did go ahead, the biggest losers could end up being the employees of EADS. Discussions between EADS and IG Metall, Germany's top metal workers' union, broke down at the end of last week over fears that job security is not guaranteed in the event of a merger. J\u00fcrgen Kerner, a member of IG's executive board, said workers felt let down at the lack of solidarity shown to them by the company's management.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed that no actions have followed the fancy promises of EADS's executive board,\" he said. He added a merger would only work if EADS's 50,000 employees in Germany were given job guarantees.</p> <p>However, it is understood that Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, has been using US government concerns over the transaction, and the unease on the Tory backbenches about job security, to leverage a better deal for Britain. The formidable obstacle of Washington is next and it is one that is being eyed nervously by BAE shareholders. If a deal is agreed between European governments, the transaction moves across the Atlantic to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a state body chaired by the US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. Because the Pentagon is BAE's biggest single customer, a merger with another foreign entity requires the blessing of CFIUS. Clay Lowery, a former US treasury official who oversaw the CFIUS process under George W Bush, said he expected the deal to go through, but scrutiny is likely to last longer than 75 days \u2013 the minimum 30-day inquiry plus a 45-day extension. \"I believe if this transaction comes together it will go through. But some of the national security mitigation steps could be tougher than they are currently for BAE. And it could be a longer negotiation than 75 days,\" said Lowery.</p> <p>BAE's US interests, as well as those of EADS, are covered by special security arrangements that ringfence the operation of Pentagon contracts from non-US interference. For instance, the board of BAE's US subsidiary, BAE Systems Inc, must be dominated by US nationals and the unit cannot operate outside the US without the Pentagon's blessing. Lowery added CFIUS could require that the combined BAE and EADS US business becomes a \"proxy\" company sealed off from its owner, with the parent receiving the profits and nothing else. This was one scenario Invesco was alluding to when it warned that the deal could \"heavily impair\" BAE's commercial prospects \u2013 \"especially in the US\".</p> <p>The Financial Times reported that at least six of the biggest 20 BAE shareholders are warning that they support Invesco.</p> <p>Lowery added: \"he focus at BAE and EADS has got to be what's going on in France, Germany, Spain and the UK, as well, of course, as with their shareholders and employees.

The sale brings to an end a sorry chapter in BP's history: it had to pay $13m in July to settle 409 safety violations found by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration following the disaster, which was the worst industrial accident in the US for a generation.

Texas City refinery manager Keith Casey said the site had been transformed through an increased focus on safety and in recent months returned to profitability. \"It does not, however, fit with the long-term strategic direction of BP's global refining portfolio,\" he said. The sale price is made up of $600m in cash, $1.2bn for inventories and $700m that Marathon will pay BP over the next six years in an \"earn-out\" arrangement based on the refinery's future operation and margins. The 2,200 people working at Texas City are expected to transfer to the new owner, a \"downstream\" company (ie involved in selling and distributing natural gas and crude oil products) which already has a small refinery in Texas City. BP initially embarked on a $23bn selling spree to raise cash for liabilities and fines after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, then last year it raised the target amount it wanted to raise from selling \"non-core\" assets to $38bn. The sale of the Texas City refinery, which also includes liquified natural gas pipelines and four marketing terminals in the south-east US, comes after the recent offloading of BP's Carson refinery in California and brings the total disposals to $35bn.

Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> The immediate read across is Morgan Crucible given its solar related/renewables in China. Elsewhere, IMI and Bodycote on the truck reference but we have spent a great deal of time with Bodycote ahead of our initiation last week and IMI was in robust form on Thursday at the capital markets day. </blockquote> <p>With the weakness in the steel industry highlighted by Cookson's figures, Russian steel producer <strong>Evraz</strong>, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, dropped 9.4p to 244.7p.</p> <p>Commodity companies in general were undermined by the World Bank warning of a continuing slowdown in China, a key market these days. So <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> lost 33p to \u00a310.68 and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> was 7.6p lower at 325.7p.</p> <p>All that helped push the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down 29.28 points to 5841.74.

There was no guidance from Wall Street, which was closed for the Columbus Day holiday. On Tuesday the US reporting season begins with Alcoa, and analysts believe the global slowdown will be reflected in the latest company reports.</p> <p><strong>Aquarius Platinum</strong> fell 4.75p to 42.75p after chief executive Stuart Murray left the mining group after ten years amid continuing unrest in South Africa. No reason was given for his departure. The company has been struggling with falling platinum prices recently but a growing concern is the strikes for higher wages which are spreading across the industry, with the unrest leading to almost 50 people losing their lives.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Xstrata</strong>, still in the throes of attempting a merger with commodities group Glencore, lost 3.3p to 950.2p after the company confirmed workers at its Eland platinum mine had gone on strike on Friday.</p> <p>Worries about the situation in South Africa have also hit insurer <strong>Old Mutual</strong>, down 2.9p to 169.5p on concerns about its operations in the country.</p> <p>Recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong> dipped 2.1p to 363p after its second profit warning in less than a year. The company said third quarter profits fell 8% compared to the previous three months and 11% on the same period last year, so full year operating profits would be slightly below current City expectations</p> <p><strong>FirstGroup</strong> continued to fall in the wake of last week's decision to remove the West Coast rail franchise from the company, down 5.3p to 190.8p. Analysts at Liberum Capital said FirstGroup's balance sheet could be hit by the move, and it might need a cash call of around \u00a3400m.</p> <p>Liberum's Peter Hyde said:</p> <blockquote> Clearly investment is not for the faint hearted. However, at the current share price, and even assuming a \u00a3400 rights issue, we see possible upside. </blockquote> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> lost 3.1p to 65.6p in the wake of weekend reports that <strong>Morrisons</strong>, up 5.7p to 283.9p, planned to launch on online food service next year.</p> <p><strong>Halfords</strong> accelerated 12p to 314.6p as analysts at HSBC raised their target price on the retailer from 215p to 330p in the wake of last week's better than expected results. They lifted their pretax profit estimates for 2013-2015 by 8%-12% but kept their neutral rating after the group's recent strong share price performance.</p> <p>A broker upgrade also lifted data centre operator <strong>Telecity</strong> by 18p to 957p. Berenberg said:</p> <blockquote> We are raising Telecity's price target from 960p to \u00a311 and maintain our buy recommendation. Telecity is one of the highest-quality names in our coverage. It has a near monopoly position due to the eco-system it has created inside its data centres, which leads to less than 5% churn and greater than 90% recurring revenues. </blockquote> <p>Finally UK snack maker<strong> Zetar</strong> jumped 23% to 291p. After the market closed on Friday the company announced it had accepted a \u00a343m, 297p a share offer from German food group Zertus.</p>",

A broker upgrade also lifted data centre operator Telecity by 18p to 957p. Berenberg said: We are raising Telecity's price target from 960p to \u00a311 and maintain our buy recommendation. Telecity is one of the highest-quality names in our coverage. It has a near monopoly position due to the eco-system it has created inside its data centres, which leads to less than 5% churn and greater than 90% recurring revenues. Finally UK snack maker Zetar jumped 23% to 291p. After the market closed on Friday the company announced it had accepted a \u00a343m, 297p a share offer from German food group Zertus.",

      "bodyText": "The US oilfield services company Halliburton has found a seven-inch radioactive rod it lost in the Texas desert almost a month ago. The company lost the rod, which contains americium-241/beryllium, during a 130-mile journey between oil well sites in Pecos and Odessa on 11 September. A spokesman for Halliburton said the device was found late on Thursday night on a road about seven miles from the well site in Pecos, where the rod was last used. Midland County sheriff Gary Painter said an oilfield pumper recognised the device from fliers that had been handed out in the area. Halliburton workers, police officers and the national guard had been involved in searching for the rod, which is stamped with a radiation symbol and the words \"Danger Radioactive: Do not handle.

It is the first time the loss of a radioactive rod has been recorded by the NRC in at least five years, a spokesman for the agency said. The three-man Halliburton crew who lost the rod had been using it to identify oil and gas deposits suitable for fracking.

      "bodyText": "Weakness in the global steel market has led to a profit warning from industrial group Cookson, sending its shares tumbling nearly 14%. It said trading performance in its engineered ceramics division in the third quarter, and the last month in particular, had been weaker than expected. The division supplies products and systems to the steel industry, which accounts for around half its revenue, and has been hit by falls in steel production. According to industry statistics production fell by 3% in July and August excluding China, and 1% for the world as a whole. September has seen further weakening, rather than the usual upturn after the summer lull: News flow from the ultimate end-markets, such as heavy truck, higher-end automotive, wind turbines, and construction, mining and agricultural equipment, is indicating a further general slowdown in production levels that started to become evident towards the end of the second quarter. The division's solar business also continued to be depressed, the company said, and it has taken action to cut costs including closing one of its two Chinese factories, resulting in a \u00a316m write-off and \u00a31m of restructuring costs. Cookson said if the situation continued, the performance of its ceramic division in the second half would be below expectations and lower than the first six months: As a result, full year performance for the group as a whole is now expected to be materially below the board's previous expectations. The company said plans for its proposed demerger were progressing well and it expected to give a further update before the end of the year. The dismal outlook has sent its shares down 85p to 530p, and Michael Blogg at Investec said he expected earnings estimates to fall by 10% to 15% after the news. Morgan Crucible Company, which also makes industrial ceramics, is down 25.2p to 254.3p. Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said: The immediate read across is Morgan Crucible given its solar related/renewables in China. Elsewhere, IMI and Bodycote on the truck reference but we have spent a great deal of time with Bodycote ahead of our initiation last week and IMI was in robust form on Thursday at the capital markets day. With the weakness in the steel industry highlighted by Cookson's figures, Russian steel producer Evraz, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, has fallen 12.5p to 241.6p, the biggest faller in the leading index. Commodities companies in general are weaker, after the World Bank cut its growth forecasts for the key Asia and Pacific region, saying the slowdown in China could get worse and last longer than expected. Vedanta Resources has lost 40p to \u00a310.61 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation is down 10.7p at 322.6p.
