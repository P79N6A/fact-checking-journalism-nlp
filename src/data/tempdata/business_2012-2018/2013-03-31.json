      "bodyText": "The 80:20 rule applies to the government's austerity policies: about 20% of the Treasury plan for rebuilding public finances rests on tax rises, while 80% comes from reductions in spending. In the current phase, welfare spending faces the biggest squeeze. Back in 2010, in the immediate aftermath of the general election, all eyes in the coalition were on the figure for annual public sector net borrowing. This measure shows how much debt is added to the government's mountain of IOUs each year. It was expected to fall only marginally from the record \u00a3156bn set in 2009 by the Labour administration. The cabinet agreed a plan to bring the annual overspend down from almost 12% of GDP to less than 3% by 2015-16, which was two years faster than Labour believed possible. Tax rises were the first to take effect. An increase in VAT to 20% was allied to a rise in capital gains tax and a \u00a32bn levy on the banks. George Osborne also implemented Labour's 50p top rate of tax for people earning more than \u00a3150,000. In the slipstream came cuts to Whitehall and local authority spending designed to help the government achieve budget cuts \u2013 after inflation \u2013 averaging 25% over four years. Health, education and international aid budgets were spared the axe, leaving other departments to take even bigger hits. Public sector workers suffered a pay freeze and then a 1% cap. Osborne planned to impose drastic cuts on welfare spending in 2013, but he expected the economy to be in better shape. In 2010, many analysts said the government's hope was that a recovery would be in full swing by this year and welfare cuts would be quietly forgotten. However, two key elements of the Treasury's plans have gone awry. By 2013 the economy was supposed to be 6.3% larger, but instead it delivered a double-dip recession and over 2011 and 2012 in effect flatlined. With growth nonexistent, tax revenues were lower than expected and it became harder to reduce government spending. The Treasury's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), expected the annual deficit to be \u00a389bn in 2012-13 and then \u00a360bn in 2013-14. In his most recent budget Osborne conceded that borrowing would be \u00a3120bn in both years, adding to a debt accumulator total that most experts believe will be \u00a3250bn higher than the OBR expected to be run up over five years when the plan was hatched in 2010. Another element, the cost of implementing Iain Duncan Smith's universal credit, which has needed considerable funds for new computer systems and administration before the largely online scheme begins to save money, was initially underestimated. It is due to go live for new claimants in October, but three out of four \"pathfinder projects\" were delayed last week and the October start date may also be deferred. In the meantime, the government has saved \u00a3432m by cutting 10% from the council tax benefit grant to local authorities. The Resolution Foundation thinktank believes the move, which scraps the grant and replaces it with a payment worth 90% of its value, will hit 3.2m low-income households who pay no council tax or a reduced charge. One of several benefit cuts to take effect from April 6 \u2013 which include the cut to child benefit for higher-rate taxpayers, reductions in disability living allowance, housing benefit cuts and a 1% cap on annual rises in benefit payments \u2013 council tax benefit cuts are designed to push government spending to less than 40% of GDP from a peak of 48% in 2009.",

But the bucolic scene is misleading: Alderley Park is in fact the nerve centre for research and development at AstraZeneca, Britain's second largest pharmaceutical company. In this rustic hideaway, scientists pioneered anaesthetics and some of today's most commonly used breast cancer treatments, while pharmacologist Sir James Black developed beta blockers; a replica of his Nobel medal is proudly displayed at the entrance of the sandstone-and-steel research lab. But the future of this scientific Eden is now under threat, after AstraZeneca announced earlier this month that all research and development at Alderley Park would cease by 2016, with the loss or relocation of more than 2,000 jobs. The move is a devastating blow to Cheshire, as well as a snub to the local MP, chancellor George Osborne, who vowed to start \"a march of the makers\" \u2013 a revitalisation of Britain's declining manufacturing and hi-tech industries, which have shrunk in the shadow of an outsize financial services sector. Despite the lofty talk, the march of the drugmakers seems to have stalled. Job cuts at AstraZeneca will see the company lose more than a tenth of its UK workforce. This follows close on the heels of a decision by US rival Pfizer to mothball a science park in Sandwich, Kent, shedding 1,500 jobs. Some AZ scientists will get the chance to transfer to a \u00a3330m \"strategic global R&amp;D centre\" in Cambridge. But locals are disappointed at AstraZeneca's decision to pull the plug on research at Alderley Park, home to half a century of scientific discoveries dating back to the now defunct British industrial giant ICI. \"It seems ridiculous they are taking it from Cheshire,\" says Colin Marlow, 65, a retired joiner who worked at Alderley Park for 34 years. \"There are a lot of clever people round here. Why should they have to go down to Cambridge?\" Richard Smith, 39, is worried the job cuts will damage local businesses, including his trade as an electrician. \"It is not good for the area. Even if it doesn't affect you, it sets waves in motion. If people haven't got money in their pockets, they won't be spending.\" For when AstraZeneca moves out of its labs, it affect not only 1,600 scientists and technicians, but the small army of caterers and cleaners who serve the 400-acre site, as well as the dozen taxi firms that ferry AstraZeneca bosses from Manchester Airport to Alderley Park. Gary Owen, north-west regional officer at the Unite union, estimates 1,000 people working at Alderley Park as contractors, mostly living in Stockport, Congleton and Macclesfield, will be hit by the closure. The ripples will also be felt in some of the richest parts of England, including Alderley Edge, a smart village that is home to Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and boasts a traditional high street with several fine wine shops and old-fashioned barber. \"You can't lose a significant number of high-value jobs without missing the spending power, so it will have that knock-on effect,\" says Frank Keegan, conservative councillor for Alderley Edge, who is especially concerned about the effect on the local fee-paying school. The Egerton Arms, a timber-beamed pub in nearby Chelford, sees good business from AstraZeneca workers. \"The joke in the pub is 'we love AZ' because they account for 25% of our lunch business,\" says Jeremy Hague, 43, the landlord-owner, who is hopeful \"an equally large company\" will take the site. Alan Clarke, chairman of Nether Alderley parish council, home to the labs, says locals are upset at the company's decision to quit the \"fabulous facilities\" at Alderley Park. \"Nether Alderley has just over 500 residents in 350 houses and up until recently 5,000 people worked in the parish. Taking that number of people out will have a tremendous effect on house prices and local shops.\" He understands that AstraZeneca has had its problems. \"They need new drugs, they need new discoveries: but it is fairly drastic to move 200 miles away.\" AstraZeneca's woes are no secret in Cheshire. The company has no new blockbuster drugs in its pipeline, while two of its biggest money-spinners, Nexium stomach-acid pills and the Crestor cholesterol treatment, will see their US patents expire in 2014 and 2016. With no big prospects on the horizon, AstraZeneca reported a 34% slump in profits to $8.1bn (\u00a35.3bn), compared with $12.8bn in 2011. Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, thinks AstraZeneca must take care not to disrupt the workforce that is the backbone of its R&amp;D infrastructure. \"[The workforce] have got to feel that they are part of the whole process \u2026 and that is not easy, because people are worried about their jobs.\" A number of people might be confused about why going south will have a positive impact on the company's performance, Malik said. \"It is becoming quite crowded around places like Cambridge. I think what they have to demonstrate is that, wherever they are located, they can collaborate with the academic groups. \"The only way to grow,\" he added, \"is to bring really innovative products to the market that meet an unmet or poorly met medical need in a radical way.\" A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the company \"will continue to have a strong presence in the north-west\" with 3,000 employees remaining at a manufacturing and packing plant in Macclesfield. Around 700 people will remain at Alderley Park in non-research jobs. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, is optimistic that the UK remains a \"pretty attractive proposition\" for hi-tech R&amp;D. Pharmaceuticals would play an important role in rebalancing the economy, she said, but it, like other manufacturing industries, had been facing tough times \u2013 \"it has been a massive uphill challenge for these makers\". So far, she sees no compelling evidence that the revitalisation of manufacturing is happening quickly enough. \"Some of that is down to the world economy and our biggest export markets in Europe, which have been really struggling over the last few years, but there is also a need for much more of a relentless push on the kind of policies that are going to support that investment, export and rebalancing.\" She singles out uncertainty about energy policy, as well as lack of focus on developing \"the pipeline for skills for industry for the future\", as particular weak points. In Alderley Edge, local councillor Keegan is confident that the skills-rich workforce will lure a new tenant to the science park: \"It is undoubtedly a blow that a major group will be relocating to the Cambridge area \u2026 but we have still got a terrific amount to offer for companies that want to come.\" In the short term, those vanishing jobs, against the backdrop of a gloomy economy, concerns locals. \"There is no question that the desirability of Alderley Park is huge,\" said Nick Rowcliffe, 65, a retired estate agent. \"In the next 10 years Alderley Park will probably be filled in some sort of glorious form or other. But the period between AZ going and all those people with disposable income losing their jobs is worrying.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christine Tacon hasn't even officially started her job overseeing relations between the UK's major supermarkets and their suppliers, yet she already has a long \"to do\" list. As the groceries code adjudicator, Tacon will be in charge of implementing a code of practice put in place three years ago. Grocers with a turnover of \u00a31bn or more, such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda or Morrisons, are already supposed to be bound by rules designed to protect suppliers from payment delays or retrospective changes to terms and conditions. But Tacon has come across stories of supermarket demanding sudden \u00a31m payments from suppliers, imposing heavy fines when food is wasted through no fault of the supplier and \"accidentally\" paying less than agreed for a product and never making up the difference. One chain even fines suppliers \u00a385 every time it receives a customer complaint relating to their product, even if the supplier is not at fault. The legislation that will give Tacon her authority is likely to receive royal assent in the next few weeks, after months of wrangling by MPs over the details of her role. Until then she is spending a day a week travelling around the country listening to suppliers' stories so she can be ready to launch official investigations when she starts in June. An engineer by training and mother of two teenagers, Tacon has a no-nonsense attitude that should send a cold blast of change through the industry. The code does not govern the prices retailers agree with their suppliers, but is designed to prevent retailers from moving the goalposts part-way through a contract. \"I'm there to make sure there is no bullying,\" says Tacon, who will be based at the Office of Fair Trading in the City of London, but will be completely independent from its normal competition and consumer activities. \"Everyone is frightened and they don't feel they can complain. This code of practice is law but it can be the case that nobody at senior level within a retailer knows about anything going wrong.\" The code bans retailers from pursuing a number of long-favoured wheezes designed to boost their profits at the expense of farmers and producers of items ranging from food and drink to toiletries and pet food \u2013 clothing and tobacco are not covered. Practices like forcing suppliers to obtain goods or services from third parties \u2013 such as hauliers, who pay the retailer for the arrangement \u2013 or demanding fees for products, promotions, complaints-handling, marketing or wastage are all prohibited. Nevertheless, Tacon says, these things go on because no one is there to support the suppliers \u2013 or those inside the supermarket giants who try to ensure fair play. \"I have heard of three instances fairly recently,\" she says, \"where suppliers have been told: 'If you want to stay on our shelves, you have to pay \u00a31m.' The retailers are being opportunistic.\" She believes that retailers sometimes demand payments for no other reason than that they have examined a supplier's accounts and found they are making rather more profit than they deem necessary. \"If that retailer is 30% of your annual sales, what are you going to do?\" Her long-term aim is to rebuild trust in the whole supply chain so that every link can begin working together in a more constructive way. She believes proper discussions about methods of distribution, auditing and lab tests will result in more efficient ways of working and reduced costs for everyone. She's also very definite about another point: \"What we don't want to do is start increasing food prices for consumers.\" The British Retail Consortium, which represents all of the major supermarkets, has lobbied against Tacon's role for that very reason, warning that dealing with a new administrative body would \"increase costs for consumers but achieve nothing new\". It has expressed doubts about the cost of running the adjudicator's office being kept within its estimated budget of \u00a3800,000 a year \u2013 a sum that will be paid by the 10 largest food retailers. Tacon counters that supermarkets do not realise the extra costs they themselves are creating throughout the industry by not paying suppliers accurately and fairly. One common money-making ruse she identifies is suppliers being fined \u00a310 a unit \u2013 regardless of what that unit is or what it costs \u2013 when they cannot provide goods above and beyond the amount contracted each week. Tacon says suppliers end up overproducing because they don't want to get penalised for non-delivery, but can then end up saddled with unwanted food, which drives up overall costs. \"If retailers stop doing these things, they can save the industry money. Then they can get involved in real price negotiations,\" she says. Having worked for both retailers and suppliers, Tacon has a good insight into the tricks of the trade on both sides. She ran the Co-op's farming business for 11 years, dealing with the group's own producers and 200 other farmers that supply its supermarkets. While there, Tacon overhauled the whole set-up, making it more efficient and helping put British-produced food at the heart of the Co-op's marketing message. Today she sits on the board of several farm-related businesses, including Anglia Farmers, a co-operative that buys in supplies \u2013 from feed and fertiliser to wind turbines \u2013 and UK Farming, an investment fund that buys land and farms it. Before that, she spent four years as UK commercial director for New Zealand butter-maker Anchor, and did stints at brick maker Redland and as a marketing consultant to Vodafone's National Lottery bid. A chartered engineer who enjoys vintage cars and travelling about on her narrowboat, Tacon got her first job in the die-casting division of British conglomerate Coats Viyella. But she stepped out of her overalls to join Mars, alongside the likes of Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King, Richard Baker, the former boss of Boots who is now chairman of Virgin Active gyms and furniture store DFS, and Sarah Weller, the former boss of Argos. Now as the champion of hard-pressed suppliers, Tacon will be going into battle against King. She will have two avenues open to her \u2013 arbitrating on disputes and investigating complaints made anonymously or by third parties such as the National Farmers Union. She's hoping to do no more than three or four such investigations a year: \"I can say: 'If you sort this out, I won't need to investigate'.\" As retailers will have to bear the cost of such investigations, she believes it will be in their interests to stick to the code, and none of them wants to break the law. Her powers to demand information from retailers will also give more support to supermarkets' own code compliance officers, who will find the presence of the adjudicator gives them more clout as they attempt to find out whether their colleagues are breaking the code. If retailers don't toe the line, Tacon will be able to force them to apologise for their behaviour \u2013 in prominent newspaper ads \u2013 or impose fines of potentially millions of pounds. Her first priority will be working out the detail of those fines. One idea is to match the payment to the amount of profit the retailer makes from flouting the code. Whatever she decides, the system will be sent out for 12 weeks of consultation and should be in place within six months of her role becoming law. Retailers will have full right of appeal against any fines imposed. Tacon was in the House of Lords to watch the bill that will create her job being given final approval as it heads towards royal assent. Peering over the public gallery's ornate wooden balcony, she nodded in agreement as the importance of financial sanctions was set out. She is impatient to get started, but in the meantime, she makes this appeal to the industry: \"I need to keep hearing these stories from people. I don't expect anyone to put anything in writing. I'm happy to meet people and collect stories to build up a picture of what the big issues actually are.\"",

      "body": "<p>Christine Tacon hasn't even officially started her job overseeing relations between the UK's major supermarkets and their suppliers, yet she already has a long \"to do\" list. As the groceries code adjudicator, Tacon will be in charge of implementing a code of practice put in place three years ago.</p> <p>Grocers with a turnover of \u00a31bn or more, such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda or Morrisons, are already supposed to be bound by rules designed to protect suppliers from payment delays or retrospective changes to terms and conditions. But Tacon has come across stories of supermarket demanding sudden \u00a31m payments from suppliers, imposing heavy fines when food is wasted through no fault of the supplier and \"accidentally\" paying less than agreed for a product and never making up the difference. One chain even fines suppliers \u00a385 every time it receives a customer complaint relating to their product, even if the supplier is not at fault.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/groceriescodeadjudicator.html\" title=\"\">legislation that will give Tacon her authority</a> is likely to receive royal assent in the next few weeks, after months of wrangling by MPs over the details of her role. Until then she is spending a day a week travelling around the country listening to suppliers' stories so she can be ready to launch official investigations when she starts in June.</p> <p>An engineer by training and mother of two teenagers, Tacon has a no-nonsense attitude that should send a cold blast of change through the industry. The code does not govern the prices retailers agree with their suppliers, but is designed to prevent retailers from moving the goalposts part-way through a contract.</p> <p>\"I'm there to make sure there is no bullying,\" says Tacon, who will be based at the Office of Fair Trading in the City of London, but will be completely independent from its normal competition and consumer activities. \"Everyone is frightened and they don't feel they can complain. This code of practice is law but it can be the case that nobody at senior level within a retailer knows about anything going wrong.\"</p> <p>The code bans retailers from pursuing a number of long-favoured wheezes designed to boost their profits at the expense of farmers and producers of items ranging from food and drink to toiletries and pet food \u2013 clothing and tobacco are not covered. Practices like forcing suppliers to obtain goods or services from third parties \u2013 such as hauliers, who pay the retailer for the arrangement \u2013 or demanding fees for products, promotions, complaints-handling, marketing or wastage are all prohibited.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Tacon says, these things go on because no one is there to support the suppliers \u2013 or those inside the supermarket giants who try to ensure fair play.</p> <p>\"I have heard of three instances fairly recently,\" she says, \"where suppliers have been told: 'If you want to stay on our shelves, you have to pay \u00a31m.' The retailers are being opportunistic.\"</p> <p>She believes that retailers sometimes demand payments for no other reason than that they have examined a supplier's accounts and found they are making rather more profit than they deem necessary. \"If that retailer is 30% of your annual sales, what are you going to do?\"</p> <p>Her long-term aim is to rebuild trust in the whole supply chain so that every link can begin working together in a more constructive way. She believes proper discussions about methods of distribution, auditing and lab tests will result in more efficient ways of working and reduced costs for everyone.</p> <p>She's also very definite about another point: \"What we don't want to do is start increasing food prices for consumers.\"</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium, which represents all of the major supermarkets, has lobbied against Tacon's role for that very reason, warning that dealing with a new administrative body would \"increase costs for consumers but achieve nothing new\". It has expressed doubts about the cost of running the adjudicator's office being kept within its estimated budget of \u00a3800,000 a year \u2013 a sum that will be paid by the 10 largest food retailers.</p> <p>Tacon counters that supermarkets do not realise the extra costs they themselves are creating throughout the industry by not paying suppliers accurately and fairly. One common money-making ruse she identifies is suppliers being fined \u00a310 a unit \u2013 regardless of what that unit is or what it costs \u2013 when they cannot provide goods above and beyond the amount contracted each week. Tacon says suppliers end up overproducing because they don't want to get penalised for non-delivery, but can then end up saddled with unwanted food, which drives up overall costs.</p> <p>\"If retailers stop doing these things, they can save the industry money. Then they can get involved in real price negotiations,\" she says.</p> <p>Having worked for both retailers and suppliers, Tacon has a good insight into the tricks of the trade on both sides.

Extra caution is needed when the great, good and wise all seem to be wishing for the same thing. Right now, the object of desire is growth. We have spent the first quarter of the year, which ends on Sunday, just one snowfall away from a triple-dip recession. The single point of agreement among \"the people who really understand \u2026 the top people\" (as former chancellor Hugh Gaitskell scathingly put it) is that we need to get the growth motor back at full throttle to lift us clear of any such dangers. True, they do not agree on how this is to be achieved. George Osborne has placed his faith in monetary activism, and this week sees the first meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee since the chancellor used his budget on 20 March to loosen its remit and make official what the MPC has been doing anyway, which is to take account of growth as well as inflation. Others, such as Labour's Treasury team, are keener on a fiscal stimulus, with more spending and lower taxes. But the objective remains the same: growth. Because the alternative to growth is \u2013 all together now \u2013 a \"Japanese-style lost decade\". In fact, Japan seems already to have clocked up more than 20 years of sluggish economic activity, giving rise to the Lady Bracknell-esque thought that, when it comes to losing decades, the Japanese are getting a little careless. And in an atmosphere in which all agree that Japan's fate is one to be avoided at all costs, it seems poor taste to suggest that there are worse experiences than 10 years of weak economic performance. Perhaps we ought to count our blessings. We should do just that. Blessing number one is the resilience of the labour market, with record numbers in work and nothing like the levels of unemployment that one would have forecast during the worst economic conditions for 80 years. Yes, many of the jobs are part-time or involve self-employment, but things could be a great deal worse and, indeed, those of us who remember the early Thatcher years or the 1990-91 recession fully expected that they would be. Over the long term, of course, economic growth is a prerequisite of a buoyant labour market. In the short term, however, that is far from the case. To give one example, the economy grew reasonably strongly from the start of 1982, yet unemployment as measured by the claimant count did not peak until July 1986. That was a jobless recovery with a vengeance. Linked to this is blessing number two, which is the reluctance of private-sector employers to reduce staff numbers, preferring instead to tolerate a recent productivity performance that is dire even by British standards. We keep hearing of a \"productivity puzzle\", but there is nothing to puzzle about \u2013 if growth is flat or falling and employment numbers stable or rising, there is only one variable left, and that is productivity. As to the reasons behind this labour-hoarding, they would have to include an expectation in the boardroom of eventual recovery, a desire to avoid hefty restructuring expenses such as redundancy payments and a preference for human workers over costly investment in capital equipment. The Bank of England has even made the intriguing suggestion that tough times have forced firms to hire more sales and marketing staff, because customers are harder to find. The third blessing for which we ought to be grateful is the remarkably low cost of borrowing and its big corollary, the relatively small numbers of mortgage-holders having their homes repossessed. Low interest rates have also, of course, helped keep afloat individuals and businesses whose level of indebtedness would, in previous downturns, have caused them to sink. It is usually at this point that someone wheels out the Z-word: zombie. The economy, we are told, is populated by walking-dead households and businesses, kept unnaturally in being by freakishly low interest rates. Indeed, the zombies are said to be holding back the economy because they are hanging on to capital that would be better deployed elsewhere. This argument is really just a 21st-century version of all that talk in the early 1980s about \"real\" versus \"unreal\" jobs (the Tory government claimed to be creating the former, which unlike the latter did not rely on subsidies or restrictive trade-union practices). But if a job allows its holder to pay the mortgage and bills, then that is \"real\" enough for most people. In a sense, we are also re-running the arguments of 2008-09 about the relative desirability of a V-shaped or L-shaped recession, the first being deep, painful and short, with rapid recovery, and the second being shallow and drawn out. As then, those urging a diet of cold turkey, with the liquidation of zombie companies and \"supply-side shock and awe\", are those who can stand the racket: the better-off. For the majority, the prospect of 10 years of sideways economic drift is not really so terrible, as long as they can earn money and keep a roof over their heads. Lord Heseltine muses that Britain may lack the ambition to create the sort of growth he would like to see. Maybe, but there are worse things to lack. Who's afraid of the lost decade?
