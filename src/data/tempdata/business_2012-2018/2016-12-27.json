      "bodyText": "The link between executive pay and company performance is negligible, according to a study that will fuel arguments for reform of corporate wage packets. The chief executives of Britain\u2019s leading 350 companies each took home a median pay package of \u00a31.9m in 2014, a rise of 82% on 13 years ago, research commissioned by the UK arm of the CFA Institute, the global association of investment professionals, found. But the rise was not mirrored in the fortunes of their employers, with return on invested capital \u2013 the report\u2019s preferred measure of performance \u2013 up by less than 1%. The authors of the report said: \u201cOur findings suggest a material disconnect between pay and fundamental value generation.\u201d The study of businesses listed on the FTSE 350 by Lancaster University Management School found that the increase in pay since 2003 was largely down to performance-related bonuses. This was despite the fact that \u201cthe median FTSE 350 company generated little in the way of a meaningful economic profit over the period 2003-2014,\u201d it said. The report warned that measures typically used by companies to calculate performance, such as total shareholder return and earning per share growth, placed too much emphasis on \u201cshort-term\u201d results. The CFA UK chief executive, Will Goodhart, said: \u201cToo few of today\u2019s popular approaches [\u2026] genuinely align senior executives\u2019 pay with the economic value that they create.\u201d A green paper published by the government last month signalled that companies could be forced to give shareholders more power over executive remuneration, such as a binding vote at businesses where directors have faced \u201csignificant opposition\u201d to their pay deals. Companies could also be told to publish their pay ratio \u2013 the difference between the wage packet of their best-rewarded member of staff and the least well paid. But the proposals were watered down from Theresa May\u2019s comments after becoming prime minister in July, when she suggested executives should be subject to an annual, binding vote on their remuneration. Stefan Stern, the director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the report, saying companies placed too much emphasis on suspect measures of performance. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to measure performance intelligently because share prices move for all sorts of reasons beyond the control of the chief executive or senior management,\u201d he said. \u201c[Excess pay] is an error based on a false premise that you can construct some sophisticated formula that will link performance to pay. We just want firms to exercise a discretion that is lacking. \u201cThey\u2019ve fallen back on intricate and elaborate contracts to do the job they should be doing themselves, which is to exercise judgment.\u201d Large pay packets were often about making sure executives do not move to another company, rather than a measure of their efficacy, Stern said. Theresa May has ruled out forcing companies to put a worker on their boards, as happens in Germany. But Stern said she could still decide to mandate worker representation on the pay committees that decide executive rewards. \u201cWithout the voice of ordinary people, it\u2019s harder to ground the conversation in reality,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s government has been accused of changing the rules on public appointments to make it easier in future for ministers to pick their political allies for senior jobs at the BBC and regulators such as Ofsted. The new code on public appointments will give ministers greater powers over who oversees a raft of agencies, watchdogs and advisory committees, while weakening the involvement of the independent commissioner for public appointments, who scrutinises the system. Labour said the changes, which will come into force on 1 January, represent a \u201cpower grab\u201d by ministers and risk returning to the days of patronage and cronyism in public life. Ministers have always had the final say over appointments to senior public sector jobs, advised by a panel that shortlists \u201cappointable\u201d people. However, independent assessors, chosen by the commissioner to oversee the most important competitions, will be abolished in favour of independent senior panel members picked by ministers. The members will have to be independent of the departments and not currently politically active, but the commissioner will only have a consultative role. Ministers will also be able to overrule the panel by choosing candidates not deemed to be appointable and have the right to dispense with an open competition without the permission of the commissioner, although they will have to consult with the watchdog and openly justify the decision. Competitions under way, including searches for a chair of the BBC board and chair of Ofsted, will continue to be regulated under the old regime, but it will apply to future competitions run for those posts and many others. The government argues that the decision increases the accountability of ministers, but Labour\u2019s Andrew Gwynne warned about the greater risk of them \u201cappointing chums and donors to public office\u201d. \u201cThis Tory power grab is divisive and a worrying undermining of the role of the independent commissioner for public appointments,\u201d he said. The code was welcomed by Peter Riddell, the commissioner for public appointments, as an improvement on previous proposals set out by Sir Gerry Grimstone, a businessman who conducted a review for the government. However, he warned in his annual report last autumn that he intended to highlight any abuses if ministers did not interpret the code in the spirit of making public appointments on merit. In a statement about the code, Riddell said: \u201cI have had constructive discussions with ministers and officials as they have developed the code over the past few months. They have not accepted every suggestion, but they have made a number of important changes, notably to reinsert fairness in the list of guiding principles and the commitment to consult me both about the appointment of senior independent panel members to assessment panels and about cases where exemptions are sought from holding competitions to make appointments. \u201cI believe that the real test for the new arrangements will be how they are interpreted by ministers. To preserve the balance between their right to be fully involved in the process and to take the key decisions, while ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit, with candidates being judged on a fair and equal basis.\u201d Asked about Labour\u2019s criticism, Chris Skidmore, the minister for the constitution, defended the new code, saying it \u201crightly places ministers at the heart of the appointments process, given their accountability to parliament for public bodies\u201d. \u201cThe new code introduces greater transparency into the system and reiterates the role of a strong, independent regulator of the process through the commissioner for public appointments. I want to see a process that champions diversity and builds a democracy that works for everyone,\u201d he said. The proposals had been criticised in their consultation stage by the former commissioner for public appointments Sir David Normington and the parliamentary committee on standards in public life. Before the publication of the new code, he warned that 20 years of progress on improving the public appointments process could be put at risk. In July, the standards committee said: \u201cThe committee fears that the changes will remove some of the independent checks and balances of the public appointments process and may have the unintended effect of offering limited protection for ministers who wish to demonstrate they have appointed on merit alone.\u201d Since the original proposal, the code has been slightly altered to say the commissioner must be consulted about exemptions and the appointment of senior independent panel members, but the essence of the change remains. It comes after a number of cases in recent years in which ministers have been criticised for appointing allies to senior public positions. Under David Cameron, Philip Dilley, an engineering chief and former business adviser to the prime minister, was given the job of chair of the Environment Agency and David Prior, a former Tory MP and now minister, was appointed as chairman of the Care Quality Commission. There were also criticisms of some of Cameron\u2019s appointments he made on his departure from No 10. Last night, Lord Bew, chair of the committee on standards, told the Telegraph that the idea of putting political appointees through an interview process should be considered. He said his committee was \u201cvery interested\u201d in tightening up procedures for so that those entering the House of Lords have to go through a more rigorous tests of suitability.",

    "webTitle": "BHS workers swamp Charles Dickens charity with help requests", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A hardship charity once chaired by Charles Dickens has been overwhelmed with requests for support from struggling shopworkers in the months since the collapse of BHS. The failure of the department store chain earlier this year, which triggered 11,000 job losses, has led to a record number of applications to the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust for help. The charity assists children whose parents work in the retail sector but are struggling to make ends meet. Its grants, which start at \u00a3250, aim to help meet the cost of essentials like school uniforms, winter clothing and shoes, or specialist equipment for disabled children. The trust, which was founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants to support the bereaved family of a colleague, says it has received claims from a record 460 families over the past six months, with 275 relating to former BHS workers, according to a report in the Telegraph. The figure is a significant increase given last year\u2019s total of 150 claims. The good work of the 163 year-old charity, originally called the Purley Children\u2019s Trust, attracted the attention of Dickens, who chaired its appeal board from 1856 to 1857. But the surge in applications for support from the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust is putting pressure on the small charity, which hands out more than \u00a3350,000 to struggling families each year. On its website the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust explains that it is currently only accepting applications under its small grants scheme if it is to help with the care of a a disabled child. \u201cDue to a very high demand for our small grants, we can now only accept new applications from families where one or more children have a disability or additional needs. We will re-open funding for school uniform and other essential items on 1 April 2017.\u201d BHS is the biggest high street retailer to enter administration since the failure of Woolworths in 2008 with the shutters coming down on all of its 170 stores. The collapse of BHS and the implications for its workers and pensioners has damaged the reputation of its former owner Sir Philip Green, who is being pursued by the Pensions Regulator to resolve the \u00a3571m hole in the bust retailer\u2019s pension scheme. A postmortem into the BHS scandal by MPs concluded that Green had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS\u201d and demands that he be stripped of his knighthood. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for \u00a31. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS. Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed into administration in April. BHS is not the only high street failure to increase demand for the charity\u2019s services. The collapse of suit vendor Austin Reed, with the closure of its 120 stores in June, also meant the loss of 1,000 jobs while American Apparel made 150 staff redundant in the week before Christmas. In addition the trust supports retail workers in the wider industry including those employed by manufacturers and wholesalers. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the retail industry is the largest low pay sector in the UK. It employs 3 million people with more than half of them earning less than the voluntary living wage of \u00a39.75 in London or \u00a38.45 outside the capital. The charity has also highlighted the high proportion of retail workers who are not earning enough to life them out of poverty \u2013 defined as having an income after housing costs of less than 60% of the UK average. The row over the future of the BHS pension fund looks set to drag on into the new year despite Green\u2019s promise to \u201csort\u201d the problem back in June. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell in an attempt to force them to fill the deficit. It is understood to be seeking around \u00a3350m from Green and as much as \u00a317m from Chappell.",

Its grants, which start at \u00a3250, aim to help meet the cost of essentials like school uniforms, winter clothing and shoes, or specialist equipment for disabled children.</p> <p>The trust, which was founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants to support the bereaved family of a colleague, says it has received claims from a record 460 families over the past six months, with 275 relating to former BHS workers, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/27/bhs-collapse-puts-charles-dickens-childrens-charity-hard-times/\">according to a report in the Telegraph</a>.

      "bodyText": "Retailers are facing a tough close to the festive season amid signs that shoppers have ditched the traditional post-Christmas sales trip due to Brexit worries and the growing popularity of online stores. Shopping centres had a particularly disappointing Boxing Day, suffering a 19.9% year-on-year drop in footfall \u2013 a measure of shopper numbers. High streets saw footfall decline 2.2% compared with 2015, and for out of town retail parks footfall was down 4.2%, despite earlier optimism, according to retail analysts Springboard. That left footfall across UK shops down by 7.3% on Boxing Day, one of the most important dates in the retail calendar. Springboard, which uses electronic sensors to count shopper numbers, predicts that for the rest of this week to 31 December, footfall will be down 2.3% on the same period last year. Experts linked the decline to several factors, including fragile consumer confidence following the referendum, the rise of online shopping and changing consumer trends, in particular the growing tendency to spend on nights out, holidays and experiences rather than physical goods. Underling the strength of internet shopping, Amazon said on Tuesday that it had posted its best-ever festive shopping performance, shipping more than one billion items worldwide through its Prime membership program. Springboard noted that the drop in footfall came as the volume of online transactions on Boxing Day rose by 6.2% compared to the formerly record-breaking 2015, according to figures from e-commerce data company PCA Predict. Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s insights director, noted people\u2019s growing appetite for eating out, which is helping high streets to outperform shopping centres. \u201cAcross 2016, shopping centres have been consistently experiencing the worst footfall and we expect to see this continue this week. Their reduced appeal is a result of the fact that most centres have a more limited hospitality offering than the high street equivalent which have been recording more favourable footfall in recent months,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect that most consumers who venture out this week will be doing so for leisure as opposed to shopping, thus giving the high street the edge as it able to service the consumer demand for bars, restaurants and coffee shops.\u201d She also highlighted signs that households are worrying about financial pressures, with the pound\u2019s fall since the referendum stoking inflation by making imports to the UK more expensive. There were also concerns about more economic upheaval when the UK formally starts the process of leaving the EU. \u201cThere is a note of caution around spending at the moment ... as we get towards the period when we are going to invoke article 50 that will start to impact confidence,\u201d said Wehrle. The Boxing Day numbers compound a disappointing Christmas Eve for retailers when, instead of the expected last-minute rush of gift buyers, they saw footfall drop 5.9% on the year. One expert said 2016 had brought \u201canother challenging seasonal period for UK retailers\u201d. \u201cThe build-up in store footfall in the run-in to Christmas was slow and the last minute rush to the shops was not as intense as retailers would have hoped for. But there are enough sale days to make a difference to trading results, so there is still plenty to play for,\u201d said Tim Denison at Ipsos Retail Performance. Retailers themselves said Boxing Day had been busy with people braving the cold to queue up in the early hours for bargains. Some also noted a silver lining from the weak pound, which has attracted tourists to the UK on luxury shopping sprees because their holiday money now stretches further. The two Westfield shopping centres in London said international shoppers were making the most of the Boxing Day sales, having been big spenders over recent months. \u201cTourist spend at Westfield London in November was up 14% year-on-year and luxury spend up 21%,\u201d said Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Westfield UK and Europe.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is selling Dunlop, the sportswear brand known for its green flash tennis shoes, to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (\u00a3112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries confirmed that it will acquire the trademark rights of the Dunlop brand overseas, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Sports Direct\u2019s founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated \u00a340m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners \u2013 three years before he floated his sportswear retail chain on the stock exchange. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is associated with many sports including tennis, squash, badminton and golf. Its gear has been used by sporting figures including tennis champions Rod Laver, John McEnroe and Steffi Graf, as well as golfers such as the 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and the former world number one Lee Westwood. In a statement, Sports Direct said it did \u201cnot currently have the bandwidth to develop and manage international brands simultaneously\u201d, and needed to prioritise its core UK businesses and relationships with third-party brands. The Dunlop business made a pre-tax profit of \u00a34m on sales of \u00a341.8m, the retailer said. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, originally called the Dunlop Rubber Company, has a tyre business as well as a sports division that makes tennis and golf equipment. It already owns the rights to the Dunlop brand for other markets. Sports Direct has had a difficult 2016, in which criticism of its working practices was compounded by weak trading. In December, the retailer revealed that profits had more than halved to \u00a371.6m in the six months to 23 October. At the time, the company\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, blamed an \u201cextreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u201d for damaging its reputation. An undercover Guardian investigation last year exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. A scathing parliamentary committee report later compared conditions at its Shirebrook warehouse to a Victorian workhouse. Since then, the company has been forced to give \u00a31m in back pay to workers and offer staff guaranteed working hours. Sports Direct\u2019s share price has more than halved in the past year, with shares now changing hands for 272.4p. The retailer\u2019s profit margins have also been hit by the pound\u2019s sharp decline since the Brexit vote. Sports Direct still owns a large stable of brands including Slazenger, Everlast, Lonsdale and Karrimor.",

At the time, the company\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, blamed an \u201cextreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u201d for damaging its reputation.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">undercover Guardian investigation</a> last year exposed the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Sports Direct workers</a> were being paid less than the minimum wage. A scathing parliamentary committee report later compared conditions at its Shirebrook warehouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">to a Victorian workhouse</a>. Since then, the company has been forced to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">\u00a31m in back pay</a> to workers and offer staff guaranteed working hours. </p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s share price has more than halved in the past year, with shares now changing hands for 272.4p. The retailer\u2019s profit margins have also been hit by the pound\u2019s sharp decline since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Sports Direct still owns a large stable of brands including Slazenger, Everlast, Lonsdale and Karrimor. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The cost of rescuing Monte dei Paschi has escalated after the European Central Bank told the struggling Italian lender that it required \u20ac8.8bn (\u00a37.5bn) to mend its finances. The lender, Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, has tried in vain to arrange a \u20ac5bn rescue package with private investors but the ECB said the sum would not have been enough. Monte dei Paschi, whose history can be traced back to 1472, said it had asked the ECB to approve a \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation\u201d, a type of state intervention that allows the institution receiving it to stay solvent. The government is now expected to inject \u20ac6.5bn into the bank, according to reports, taking its stake in to about 70%. The remainder will come from institutional investors seeing their bonds converted into shares, ridding the bank of about \u20ac2bn in debt. In a statement, Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had written to the Italian finance ministry warning that the bank\u2019s liquidity position \u2013 its ability to turn assets into hard cash \u2013 had suffered a \u201crapid deterioration\u201d. This was partly down to a large number of loans made to people who cannot pay them back, among the factors that saw Monte dei Paschi come last out of 51 banks in stress tests to check lenders\u2019 resilience to economic shocks. \u201cThe bank has quickly started talks with the competent authorities to understand the methodologies underlying the ECB\u2019s calculations and introduce the measures for a precautionary recapitalisation,\u201d it said in a statement. Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had told it that the \u20ac8.8bn bailout figure was determined by the results of stress tests that the bank failed this summer. It also noted that the bank\u2019s liquidity position had worsened between the end of November and 21 December. The European commission said on Friday it would work with Rome to establish conditions for a bailout of Monte dei Paschi, likely to involve tapping a \u20ac20bn rescue pot approved by the Italian government last week. But the proposals have not met with support from more hawkish official in the ECB. Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank and a member of the ECB\u2019s governing council, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it was in a bad financial state. \u201cFor the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,\u201d he said in an article published in the German newspaper Bild. \u201cThe money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined.\u201d Monte dei Paschi has struggled to recover from the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid Santander \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled the size of the lender, transforming it into Italy\u2019s third largest behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. Three years ago, Monte dei Paschi\u2019s problems worsened and it was forced to ask the government for \u20ac4bn amid a scandal over loss-making derivatives contracts and alleged fraud. It will now go back to the government for funds after talks with private investors failed, with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund thought to have scuppered the plan by refusing to take part. The Italian government already has a 4% stake in Monte dei Paschi.",

      "bodyText": "Households are being left with less cash to spend on treats or to stash away as savings as the rising cost of essentials like food and fuel take a bigger chunk out of family budgets. A new report on household finances from Lloyds bank echoed other signs that the pound\u2019s steep fall since the Brexit vote is raising import costs for the UK and trickling through to higher prices for consumers. Household spending on essentials rose at the fastest pace for almost three years in November \u2013 going up by 1% compared to a year ago \u2013 and the bank found consumers were growing increasingly worried about price pressures. Much of the pressure on household budgets last month came from higher petrol and diesel prices. Spending on fuel soared by 5.9% year-on-year \u2013 the biggest increase since February 2013. That pre-Christmas hit to family finances was in stark contrast to the same time last year when spending on fuel sank by 9.3%. The Lloyds spending power report, which analysed current account data, also noted a relatively sharp rise in spending on food. That was up 1.6% on the year \u2013 the biggest increase in 20 months. \u201c2016 has been a year of sustained growth in consumer outgoings, with the steady rise in expenditure on food and fuel driving a significant increase in overall essential spending,\u201d said Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds. The findings chime with official figures showing inflation picked up to a two-year high of 1.2% in November. With the pound down more than 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote, economists say UK companies will continue to face rising bills for imports such as food and fuel, as inflation climbs further in 2017. Following high-profile pricing tussles between supermarkets and big brands such as Typhoo and Walkers, consumers are becoming more worried about inflation, according to surveys. Lloyds polled households to accompany its spending report and found that the percentage of people who have a negative view of inflation has risen by 11 percentage points over the last 12 months, to now stand at 49%. When asked about the outlook for their disposable income, almost a third (31%) of people saw themselves having less money in 12 months\u2019 time once all household bills and essentials are paid.",
