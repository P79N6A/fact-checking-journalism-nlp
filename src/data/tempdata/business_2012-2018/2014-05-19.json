      "bodyText": "One of the most bitterly contested takeover battles for a British firm in years has ended in recrimination as the US drugmaker Pfizer was forced to walk away from a \u00a369bn bid for AstraZeneca, sparking protests from some City institutions. Scientists, unions and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic had lined up to criticise a deal they said was motivated by tax avoidance and cuts to research jobs. However, in a sign of how much hope investors had placed in a deal going ahead, nearly \u00a37bn was wiped off AstraZeneca's share value as the market reacted to rejection of Pfizer's final bid of \u00a355 a share. The US company's approach was turned down by AstraZeneca's chairman as \"inadequate\" and a \"significant risk\" to shareholders, employees and the UK's position at the forefront of scientific research. Leif Johansson referred pointedly to Pfizer's plans to switch the combined firm's tax base to the UK, as well as the US company's admission in parliamentary hearings that there would be job cuts and a reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending. \"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation,\" said Johansson. \"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion [on Sunday night], and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case.\" Pfizer, described by a former AstraZeneca boss as a \"praying mantis\" that \"sucks the lifeblood out of their prey\", admitted defeat on Monday in its months-long campaign to pull off the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a British company. Under City rules, the only way of resurrecting the deal would be if AstraZeneca's shareholders forced the company to reconsider the offer it has already rejected. Ian Read, the Scottish-born American Pfizer chairman and chief executive, admitted that there was \"nothing more we can do\". David Cameron, who has been accused by Labour of being a cheerleader for the deal, said that the government \"quite rightly should be neutral in this.\" The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: \"We are monitoring what is happening since the AstraZeneca board very firmly rejected the proposal. The government's position is unchanged. We are keeping all options open. We have made it very clear that what we're out to protect is the national interest in research and development, manufacturing, and jobs.\" Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary and one of the deal's most vocal critics, said the rejection was welcome. However, Pfizer urged AstraZeneca's shareholders to speak out, with two big investors, the investment firm Axa and the fund manager Jupiter, publicly criticising the firm. Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at Axa Investment Managers, which holds a 4.6% stake in AstraZeneca, said he was \"very disappointed\" and rejecting the deal was \"not necessarily acting in shareholders' best interests\". Jupiter Fund Management, a top-30 investor, also criticised AstraZeneca for rejecting the offer so categorically. Speaking on condition of anonymity as AstraZeneca's shares crashed 11% to \u00a342.88, one of the company's 10 biggest shareholders said: \"This is the single biggest case of value destruction on behalf of shareholders of all time.\" The fund manager said the personality clashes between the companies' bosses had \"triumphed over shareholder-value creation\". However, a number of the British company's big investors \u2013 including Aberdeen Asset Management, M&amp;G Investments and Woodford Asset Management \u2013 supported AstraZeneca's actions. A source close to Pfizer admitted on Monday night that they would be amazed if AstraZeneca's shareholders put enough pressure on the company's board to force it to reconsider the \u00a355-a-share offer. \"They would have to make an excruciatingly loud noise,\" the source said. The final nail in the coffin of the proposed deal, which would have seen Pfizer relocate its tax base to the UK to avoid paying a multimillion-dollar US tax bill, was delivered in a transatlantic conference call on Sunday. Read spent more than an hour trying to persuade Johansson and AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, to accept the proposed deal. But the AstraZeneca bosses were adamant that the offer did not reflect the true value of the company's forthcoming cancer drugs and would put lives at risk by delaying drugs. \"If that is what you believe, I really cannot find a way to close a substantial gap,\" Read told them, according to his account of the call in the Wall Street Journal. \"And with that we left it.\" Read made the \u00a355-a-share offer public in an email to journalists late on Sunday, hoping it would fire up investors to put pressure on AstraZeneca to engage. But Johansson announced the board's rejection of the offer at 7.08am on Monday without consulting any shareholders. The board's decision was not unanimous. Unless AstraZeneca reconsiders the offer, Pfizer will be blocked by the UK's Takeover Panel from making another approach for at least six months. Umunna, who has been leading political opposition to the deal and had pledged to block it if Labour won the next election, said: \"While Labour was standing up for British jobs and British science, David Cameron and his ministers were cheerleading for a takeover bid where one of the primary motivations was financial engineering \u2013 cited by the AstraZeneca board as one of the execution risks justifying rejection of the bid.\" He added: \"Ultimately it is for the shareholders to determine, but it is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs.\" Soriot warned MPs last week that development of life-saving cancer drugs could be significantly delayed by a takeover concentrating on \"saving tax and saving costs\". \"Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline,\" he said. \"From the lab to the patient takes many years.\" Read, who had promised that the takeover would be \"a win-win\" for society, had admitted the deal would lead to job cuts and a big reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending. \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,\" he told MPs. Pfizer cut tens of thousands of jobs after previous takeovers, despite promises to the contrary, and closed most of its research lab in Sandwich, Kent, site of the discovery of Viagra, three years ago. The only guarantee that Read was prepared to give on British scientists' jobs was that 20% of the combined R&amp;D workforce would be based in Britain for the next five years. But he refused to state whether this would still represent a reduction in UK jobs. The company was also under pressure from US politicians over its controversial \"tax inversion\" plan to move its tax base, but not its headquarters, to the UK to avoid paying tax on \u00a340bn of cash made from profits overseas. Investment banking experts said the banks, lawyers, accountants and PR firms advising on the deal could have collected between \u00a3300m and \u00a3345m if the deal had gone ahead. Peter Hahn, a former managing director at Citigroup and now finance lecturer at Cass Business School, said advisers typically collect fees worth 0.5% of the deal, which would have worked out at \u00a3345m if AstraZeneca had accepted Pfizer's final \u00a355-a-share offer. However, the fees could have been even higher if the takeover battle had become even more contentious. Bankers and other advisers collected \u00a3240m advising on Kraft's \u00a312bn takeover of Cadbury in 2010, which works out at 2% of the deal. Hahn said Pfizer's banking advisers would be feeling sore because investment banking adviser contracts are generally structured so that without a deal there is no fee. \"There'll be some senior guy in New York, it could have easily cost him several million,\" Hahn said.",

      "bodyText": "Beyond the political huffing and puffing, the debate about what Pfizer would have to pay to bag AstraZeneca always seemed straightforward: a bid of \u00a360 a share or thereabouts would be a knockout; anything less and Pfizer would struggle to get an agreement. So it has proved. Pfizer proposed \u00a353.50 at the weekend but was told by AstraZeneca to add 10% \u2013 taking the offer to \u00a358.85 \u2013 to get in the game. The US group then angrily tabled \u00a355 as a take-it-or-leave-it \"final\" proposal and implored AstraZeneca's shareholders to rise up in rebellion against their recalcitrant directors. The mutiny, such as it is, looks feeble. Fund managers at Axa and Jupiter may be \"disappointed\" by the stance taken by AstraZeneca's board but that hardly amounts to a thunderous call for resignations. As AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, pointed out, independent directors are paid to give their opinion. If shareholders don't like that opinion, their only real remedy is to appoint different directors. While Axa &amp; co sulk, the rest of the world should applaud Johansson and colleagues for taking a clear decision on what's best for their company and displaying coolness under fire. Few company boards manage to behave so robustly. It is now almost impossible to see how AstraZeneca's board could change its mind about a \u00a355 bid and keep its credibility \u2013 at least, not before next Monday's deadline imposed by the Takeover Panel. And, since Pfizer cannot now bid more than \u00a355 under the panel's rules, this scrap looks to be virtually over. There is no precise science to why \u00a360-ish would have been the \"right\" price. It's just that all bid battles acquire momentum and a sense of where the winning line lies. Pfizer started poorly. Few regarded its opening pitch of \u00a350 as anything other than a sighting-shot. Worse, the offer quickly became worth only \u00a348 because Pfizer's share price fell 6%, reducing the value of the paper part of its cash-and-shares proposal. Pfizer's weak share price betrayed some nervousness among its own shareholders about the adventure \u2013 hardly surprising given that its chairman and chief executive, Ian Read, had previously said he had given up on big deals. Critically, it also reduced the bidder's firepower when the bidding became serious. Pfizer was offering an unreliable currency, and its past takeovers \u2013 Warner Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth \u2013 did not inspire confidence that the best way to pursue value was yet another round of cost-cutting. The bar for a successful share-based offer was always going to be set high; and raising the cash component to 45% from 33% was only a marginal improvement. On the defending side, Pascal Soriot did what all defending chief executives must do and painted a happy picture of life as an independent company. He argued that AstraZeneca investors had not appreciated the possible wonders in store in the group's pipeline of potential drugs, especially the cancer portfolio. His forecast that revenues could improve 75% by 2023 employed optimism, but not in heroic doses. One bank, Citi, declared AstraZeneca's \"intrinsic value\" to be \u00a349 a share. Add a 20% takeover premium to that number and you've got the \u00a358.85 figure at which AstraZeneca drew a line in the sand. In short, Read miscalculated what he would have to pay. Some would call it an understandable mistake since \u00a355 is quite a jump from AstraZeneca's share price before news of Pfizer's interest \u2013 \u00a339. Offers at a 45% premium usually succeed and AstraZeneca itself also had a long record of broken promises under Soriot's predecessor, David Brennan. But Read's naked aggression was counter-productive. \"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation,\" said Johansson. Fair comment. Pfizer never attempted to address AstraZeneca's worry that valuable research projects would be binned if the company was carved up to fit the US group's operating model. Nor did Pfizer ever go public with the size of the cost and tax savings. Would the plan to flip Pfizer's tax domicile to the UK have yielded $1bn a year or $2bn? Read, one assumes, did not want to risk a greater political backlash in the US by going into detail about the tax wheeze. But it's hard to inspire a rebellion in AstraZeneca's ranks if you don't tell investors the size of the prize they are meant to be chasing. Pfizer looked suspiciously defensive on the tax point. What happens next if, as expected, Pfizer is obliged to walk away? A bidder can return in six months' time and the US group now knows, roughly, the price it would have to pay. But \u00a370bn-plus deals tend to require many stars to align. A lot can happen in half a year. The US might ban tax inversions, or make them harder to implement. Pfizer's share price might fall, or AstraZeneca's might rise on the back of good results for drugs in late-stage clinical trials. Read's position might also come under pressure. He raised a small army of investment bankers and created a political storm on both sides of the Atlantic, but has nothing to show for his efforts despite starting as a heavy favourite. That can be career-threatening. Of course, events could go in the opposite direction. Having appealed for long-term support, AstraZeneca now has to deliver in an industry where 100% guarantees do not exist. The company has a lung cancer treatment deemed capable of generating revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a33.9bn) a year. If that were to fail in late-stage trials, AstraZeneca would be vulnerable once again. Soriot probably has about 18 months to get the share price close to \u00a350 under his own steam, which would vindicate the decision to reject \u00a355. As for British politicians, they must now decide whether a wider public interest test would be useful. All the well-aired arguments about protecting the science base, versus protecting the UK's open-doors policy on takeovers, still apply. But the story of the bid battle itself is very simple: Pfizer was over-confident and never offered enough to win. Well played, AstraZeneca's directors.",

But \u00a370bn-plus deals tend to require many stars to align.</p> <p>A lot can happen in half a year. The US might ban tax inversions, or make them harder to implement. Pfizer's share price might fall, or AstraZeneca's might rise on the back of good results for drugs in late-stage clinical trials.</p> <p>Read's position might also come under pressure. He raised a small army of investment bankers and created a political storm on both sides of the Atlantic, but has nothing to show for his efforts despite starting as a heavy favourite. That can be career-threatening.</p> <p>Of course, events could go in the opposite direction. Having appealed for long-term support, AstraZeneca now has to deliver in an industry where 100% guarantees do not exist. The company has a lung cancer treatment deemed capable of generating revenues of $6.5bn (\u00a33.9bn) a year. If that were to fail in late-stage trials, AstraZeneca would be vulnerable once again. Soriot probably has about 18 months to get the share price close to \u00a350 under his own steam, which would vindicate the decision to reject \u00a355.</p> <p>As for British politicians, they must now decide whether a wider public interest test would be useful. All the well-aired arguments about protecting the science base, versus protecting the UK's open-doors policy on takeovers, still apply. But the story of the bid battle itself is very simple: Pfizer was over-confident and never offered enough to win. Well played, AstraZeneca's directors.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Estate agency Savills has added to the alarm over Britain's property market by warning of a \"housing crisis\" stoked by a shortage of new homes. The intervention of Savills follows comments by the governor of the Bank of England, who warned of \"deep structural problems\" in the British housing market stemming from a shortage of fresh stock. Mark Carney's words have increased the pressure on the government to speed up the planning process and row back on reforms that have devolved house-building decisions in England to local authorities. Savills has estimated that the shortfall in homes in the south of England will reach 160,000 in the next five years, unless local authorities act to make more building possible. \"The talk of bubbles may be misplaced in a strict sense, but talk of a housing crisis isn't,\" said Savills in a report published on Tuesday. The biggest deficiency is in London, where 14,400 more homes a year are needed to meet demand than are planned for by the Greater London Authority (GLA). Susan Emmett, residential research director at Savills, said: \"While the Conservatives have not set a house-building target, it has been the coalition government's policy to support the housing market as a mechanism for stimulating consumer confidence, creating jobs and therefore supporting economic growth. The general consensus on the need for more homes, however, masks local disagreements over what is to be built where.\" The warnings come 10 years after the Labour government asked the economist Kate Barker to review the housing market. She said that to reduce the long-term trend in house price increases to 1.1% a year \u2013 compared with the current rate of more than 9% a year \u2013 would require 260,000 homes to be built annually. Since then, an average of just 115,000 homes have been built in the private sector each year. In March, the Home Builders Federation said that the shortfall, combined with new forecasts for demand, meant 320,000 homes a year were needed to hit the 1.1% inflation target. In the long term, more garden cities such as Ebbsfleet in Kent might provide an answer. But in the shorter term, the policymakers could do the following: 1 Streamline the planning system Once land is bought, developers then have to work with local authorities to agree a number of issues before securing initial planning permission, including levels of affordable housing, infrastructure requirements and what payments need to be made towards local services such as schools and hospitals. Once outline permission is granted, the developer will then be given a list of \"pre-commencement conditions\" to meet before building can start. This might include providing plans for landscaping or drainage. The Home Builders Federation has estimated that around 185,000 plots are stuck at this point. \"It is taking too long to finalise permission once a decision has been made that you can build somewhere,\" said a spokesman for the HBF. 2 Force local planning authorities to be more ambitious In 2012 the government devolved some planning decisions to local authorities. They are now expected to come up with a five-year plan showing the demand for new homes in their area and the land supply to meet it. Analysis by Savills shows a gap between what they say they will provide and the demand for new homes. In London, the east of England, the south-east and south-west, the gap equated to a shortfall of 160,000 homes over the next five years. \"Local authorities need to do a better job of estimating demand and planning for it,\" said Emmett. \"They also need to work with neighbouring authorities to deal with overspill, particularly in the home counties where there is overspill from London.\" The problem in some areas is that new building would need to be on greenbelt land. Emmett said a review of greenbelt land was necessary as London becomes more crowded. Currently, 13% of the land in England is designated as greenbelt, compared with 2% which is built on. 3 Fund more social and affordable housing In 29 of the 30 years up to 1978, local councils built more than 90,000 homes a year, in part replacing old and war-damaged stock, but also adding new homes. In 1999 the number was just 50. Housing associations, which are privately owned providers of social housing, meanwhile created an average of just under 19,000 homes a year. Figures released by the government last week showed that in 2013/14 just 840 new homes were completed by local councils and 22,150 by housing associations in England. Meanwhile 11,238 council homes were sold off through right to buy in England, compared with 5,944 in 2012/13. A recent report from housing charity Shelter and consultancy firm KPMG called for councils to be given more scope to finance affordable housing. Under the current regime they can borrow against future rental income but the amount is capped and some councils are at their limit. It is estimated that if the cap was raised by \u00a37bn councils could provide an extra 12,000 homes a year between them. \"Since local authorities ceased to be significant builders in their own right, we have not built enough homes to satisfy demand in England,\" the report said. \"Housing associations now supply most of our affordable homes, but have never made up the gap.\" The report also recommended a housing investment bank funded by the public through their Isas and other savings which could provide low-cost, long-term loans to affordable home providers. 4 Back small builders According to Shelter/KPMG reports, the smaller end of the housebuilder trade is in decline. Since the recession, the number of builders producing fewer than 30 units a year has declined by half, while the number of medium-sized builders has shrunk by almost two thirds. Giving small and medium-sized builders access to cheaper credit could, according to the report, support the development of an extra 3,000 homes a year. Encouraging developers to get involved with custom-build homes, where buyers can have more say in the property, could encourage more building, Shelter argues. Under this proposal, several homes can be built simultaneously by different firms on the same site. 5 Retain the first part of Help to Buy The first part of the government's Help to Buy scheme offers buyers an interest-free loan worth up to 20% of the value of a new-build home. Developers say it has been driving the supply of homes as well as demand. Government figures showed that in the first year of the scheme it had been used in just under 20,000 purchases. The HBF said that the scheme had been vital in bringing buyers back to the market after the financial downturn. \"If buyers can't buy, builders can't build,\" said a spokesman. \"In recent months this has made a huge difference to the housing starts figures.\" However, it is clear that the benefits are patchy. In some areas, eight out of 10 new-builds have been bought through Help to Buy, while other local authorities have seen no impact. At the end of March, 37% of newbuilds in the east London borough of Barking and Dagenham were funded by Help to Buy, according to Savills. So there is evidence that it could help ease the capital's housing shortage, although most new-builds in London are not bought through the scheme. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2014 after Savills provided a new figure for Help to Buy sales in Barking and Dagenham.",

      "bodyText": "That's all for today. A quick closing summary: AstraZeneca shares have closed down 11% tonight, as the prospect of a takeover from Pfizer fades away tonight. The slump wiped \u00a36.75bn off the company's value, which is now worth around \u00a315bn less than Pfizer offered to pay last night. AstraZeneca has stood firm today, insisting it was correct to reject the US company's 'final' proposal on the grounds it undervalued Astra, threatened its ability to bring vital drugs to market, and could have damaged Britain's science base. Several large shareholders have gone public with their unhappiness over Astra's decision to reject Pfizer's latest offer early this morning (full story here). But unions have urged shareholders to resist the lure of Pfizer's money, and to support Astra's board after it rejected the biggest ever takeover of a UK company by a foreign rival. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: The company has a long term plan and we would urge shareholders to back the workforce and the board.... It would not only destabilise AstraZenca, but undermine the UK\u2019s science and research base and put a jewel in the Britain\u2019s manufacturing crown at risk. AXA's Richard Marwood, who holds a 4.6% stake in Astra, said he is \"very disappointed\". Another called it the biggest destruction of shareholder value ever. Alastair Gunn of Jupiter shared that sentiment, saying: We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer\u2019s latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer on the details of the offer to assess the opportunities that a combined entity could bring.\" \"There now seems little room left to manoeuvre with Pfizer having ruled out a hostile bid. We will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the AstraZeneca board over the way the bid process has been handled up to now.\" Other investors agreed that AstraZeneca should have initiated talks with Pfizer, after receiving last night's \u00a355 per share offer, valuing the company at \u00a369bn But one City voice, Neil Woodford, has said AstraZeneca did the right thing. City analysts believe the deal is now dead, although Pfizer could make a new offer in six month's time. AstraZeneca's rejection has cost the City around \u00a3345m in fees - with some senior executives missing out on the kind of bonus that would buy a Ferrari Meanwhile in Westminster.... ...The government has tried to remain on the sidelines, having been accused of acting as a Pfizer cheerleader. David Cameron insisted that he should be neutral, while concerned for British science and jobs. And business secretary Vince Cable said the government was monitoring events, to ensure a good outcome for the UK. But shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Britain needs a tougher public interest test for such takeovers: Ultimately it is for the shareholders to determine, but it is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs. Pfizer has said today that it will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on this promise. \"Where David Cameron and his government have failed to act, the next Labour government will act to introduce a strengthened public interest test to better protect Britain's science base.\" My earlier summary shows how, and why, AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer early this morning (11 short hours ago...). Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW In other news, Royal Bank of Scotland has welcomed its new finance director to the company by giving him almost \u00a32m of shares, on his first day at RBS (still majority-owned by the taxpayer). City editor Jill Treanor has the story: Ewen Stevenson was awarded 584,506 shares, which will be released to him over three years to buy him out of pay deals he left behind at his previous employer, Credit Suisse. He is on an annual package worth \u00a31.9m a year, made up of an \u00a3800,000 salary, \u00a3280,000 in pension contributions, \u00a326,250 in benefits and \u00a3800,000 in \"allowances\", a vehicle used by banks to get round the EU bonus cap. The government has refused to allow RBS to pay bonuses of 200% of salary, subjecting the bank to the full EU cap that limits them to 100% of salary. This means the maximum Stevenson will receive is \u00a33.8m, if he meets all the targets for his bonuses. New RBS finance director receives nearly \u00a32m in shares on first day in job With Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca on the ropes tonight, investment bankers face missing out on some pretty lucrative fees. My colleague Rupert Neate has been investigating; and found that banks, lawyers, accountants and PR firms could have shared up to \u00a3345m for advising Pfizer on the deal. That's based on the typical model where advisors receive 0.5% of a deal's value. A top banker's share of the pie could have been several million pounds. The PR contract along would have been pretty lucrative, as Rupert reports: A senior PR executive at a different firm said Brunswick chairman Alan Parker would be \"devastated\" at the collapse of the deal. \"The contract would have been in the high hundreds of thousands into seven figures,\" the PR man said. \"They will be devastated by this, it would have made up a meaningful part of the bonus \u2013 it would be the difference between getting a Ferrari or not.\" One for eurozone crisis-watchers; the International Monetary Fund has (not for the first time) urged Germany to spend more on infrastructure to help the rest of the euro area. The IMF reckons Germany could spend an extra 0.5% of GDP on long-term projects without any significant impact on its budget figures. This would: \"...yield a persistent increase in GDP by crowding in private investment and would also stimulate growth in the rest of the euro area.\" More details here: With the May sun gently warming London today, traders in the Square Mile became a little sunnier themselves this afternoon, dragging the FTSE 100 off its earlier lows. The blue-chip index ended the day down just 11 points, or 0.16%, at 6844. AstraZeneca's tumble wiped 26 points off the Footsie, so it would have been an up day if Pfizer's bid hadn't, well, phizzled out. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, sums up the day: Markets pushed off their lows in Europe and the US this afternoon, but the FTSE 100 has been unable to clamber out of negative territory while AstraZeneca is down 10%. At around 3% of the index Astra is too important to ignore, but most traders are looking beyond this one stock and are generally turning more bullish as the day goes on. Ryanair\u2019s figures continue to provide positive tailwinds for easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines, who are both topping the leaderboard in London. Investors are apparently betting that consumers have tired of the extreme no-frills approached that once worked so well for Ryanair, and that the gradual return of affluence will cause people to trade up in their air travel choices. As the European elections draw near, our binary market continues to show that UKIP will likely emerge ahead of all other competitors. Increased scrutiny may put the party under pressure, but it is unlikely to cause many prospective voters to shift their ground. It seems the chance to deliver a resounding blow against \u2018the establishment\u2019 is just too good to pass up. France's CAC and Germany's DAX both rose 0.3%. But the Milan stock market had a bad day - with Italian FTSE MIB losing 1.6%. That comes amid jitters that this week's EU elections could be a triumph for anti-European parties, which could spark new fears over the eurozone. Trading in London is finished for the day, and AstraZeneca's shares have posted an 11.1% tumble, wiping around \u00a36.75bn off the company's value. Astra shares closed at \u00a342.87, down from \u00a348.23 on Friday. Shareholders may be forgiven for thinking wistfully of the \u00a355 which Pfizer offered to pay for each of their shiny shares. That valued Astra at \u00a369bn, or around \u00a38bn more than its value on Friday night. So, almost \u00a315bn of shareholder value has vanished today... Stuart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, has taken issue with his fellow Conservative member Douglas Carswell - who claimed this afternoon that politicians should keep out of takeover battles (see 2.28pm) A polite exchange of views, rather than a punch-up -- though - Carswell even retweeted Jackson's comment. City analyst Louise Cooper points out that Pfizer would have to make even tougher cost cuts to justify a higher bid: Please note that the higher AZN Board drive the price up, the larger the cuts will be if Pfizer does eventually buy it. To make the numbers work, to make the deal pay, to persuade Pfizer shareholders to back the deal, Pfizer will need to make more job cuts and research savings. So, if Pfizer does come back in six months and offer \u00a359 per share (which AstraZeneca says would be fair) it will have serious repercussions for both company's workforce. Business secretary Vince Cable has reiterated that the government's position is \"unchanged\" - it is staying on the sidelines while trying protect the national interest in R&amp;D, manufacturing and jobs. Cable told ITN that: We are monitoring what's happening since the AstraZeneca board very firmly rejected [Pfizer's] proposal. The (likely) failure of Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has dampened spirits in the City, where traders thought it might catalyse a new wave of merger activity. So argues Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets, who writes: The failure of the Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal has added to the bad feelings in markets today as a certain premium had been built into prices with the belief this mega-merger could bring about a new wave of M&amp;A. With the AT&amp;T - DirecTV deal in the US pushing ahead, Europe is lacking its own role-model for future mega-deals. Quite a contrast - Pfizer (+1.6%) is the biggest riser on the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, and AstraZeneca (-11.4%) is the biggest faller on the FSTE 100 in London: Investors appear to be agreed that Pfizer's attempt to take control of AstraZeneca is over, for now at least.... (as explained earlier, some analysts and shareholders think Pfizer could return with a new bid; after walking away for six months, as the Takeover Code demands) As we predicted at 12.22pm, well-respected City investor Neil Woodford has offered AstraZeneca his backing, saying they were right to reject Pfizer's latest bid. Woodford said the offer of \u00a355 per share didn't match Astra's long-term potential - a point that the company's management have made repeatedly in recent weeks. Woodford's support is a contrast with several other shareholders (such as AXA) who have been voicing their disappointment today. Shares in Pfizer have risen over 1.6% in early trading in New York, as Wall Street traders react to the news that the company's third bid for AstraZeneca has been slapped down. Pfizer shares rose around 50 cents to $29.60, the highest level since 6 May. They've been under pressure in recent days, in anticipation that the firm would make huge, knockout bid for AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca shares are still leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down almost 12% in London. Conservative MP Douglas Carswell has criticised the way in which Pfizer's approach to AstraZeneca became a political football (two different parliamentary committees held hearings last week). Carswell told Radio 4's The World At One that: \"Listening to the debate in Parliament, I'm very alarmed by the mood of protectionism, of what is, in effect, economic nativism. Countries that have governments that 'pick winners' become losers.\" \"I think it should disturb all of us that politicians, many of whom frankly couldn't run a bath, suddenly want us to believe that they know what is in the national interest and that they know what constitutes a good deal. It's absurd and it's ridiculous.\" In theory, ministers could have used their public interest powers to intervene, if they felt that a Pfizer takeover of AstraZeneca would be bad for Britain. But there is confusion over exactly what powers the UK had; it appears any intervention would need the approval of Brussels too. AstraZeneca's chairman has refused to say whether the board were united in rejecting Pfizer's latest approach. Leif Johansson denied failing to handle the bid correctly, and added that he sees no prospect of a deal soon. Here's the newsflashes: 14:08 - INTERVIEW-ASTRAZENECA CHAIRMAN SEES NO PROSPECT OF PFIZER PFE.N DEAL BEFORE MAY 26 OR EXTENSION OF THAT DEADLINE 14:08 - ASTRA'S JOHANSSON SAYS HAS ENGAGED WITH PFIZER, INCLUDING PHONE CALL OF MORE THAN 1 HOUR ON SUNDAY 14:08 - ASTRA'S JOHANSSON SAYS PFIZER WAS THE PARTY THAT CLOSED DOWN DISCUSSIONS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON 14:08 - JOHANSSON DECLINES TO SAY IF ASTRAZENECA BOARD'S REJECTION OF PFIZER OFFER WAS UNANIMOUS Speaking of elections, Greek politicians and citizens are digesting the results of the first round of local election voting, last weekend. Prime minister Antonis Samaras claimed that his New Democracy party had done pretty well, after a poll in which there was no clear winner. ND fell behind the opposition left-wing Syriza in Athens last weekend, but did better in seats outside the capital. But a new opinion poll today also has shown Syriza has a big lead ahead of the EU polls. Kapa Research found that Syriza have 27.4% support, followed by New Democracy with 22.7%, then the extremist Golden Dawn party with 8.7%. To Potami (known as the \"River\" party) polled 8.1%, then the Communist KKE party with 6.4%, the \"center-left\" Olive Tree allowance on 6.2%, then Independent Greeks on 4% and Democratic Left (DIMAR) with 1.4%. In the bond markets, Spanish and Italian government debt has weakened this morning as traders anticipate a strong showing for anti-establishment parties in this week's EU elections. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co, says the elections could destabilise the EU, if parties who oppose the status quo are the big winners. Here in the UK we face the strange prospect of the largest share of the vote going to a party of protest without practical policies and who do not always turn up to parliamentary sessions. More important will be how well the anti-EMU parties fare in France and Italy, which are quite likely to signal a new episode in the euro soap opera. The selloff has driven up the yield (interest rate) on benchmark Italian 10-year bonds to 3.15%, from 3.06% on Friday (yields rise when prices fall). The Spanish 10-year bond is yielding around 3%, up from 2.94%. The Wall Street Journal agrees that Pfizer cannot boost its \u00a355 offer again (as some analysts have been speculating this morning). Here's how they see the state of play: Pfizer has until May 26th to make a firm offer for AstraZeneca. But, given its statements on Sunday, it can now only do so with the recommendation of Astra\u2019s board and at a price no more than \u00a355 a share. The certainty and speed of Astra\u2019s rejection makes that highly unlikely. Moreover, UK rules prohibit Pfizer from making a bid for Astra for six months, unless recommended by the target\u2019s board. For the first three months, its \u201cno increase\u201d statement will still apply, meaning a deal would need to be agreed at \u00a355 a share. Astra\u2019s board may hint that another \u00a33 or \u00a34 could have clinched a deal. That is little comfort to the U.K. company\u2019s investors. Pfizer\u2019s hands are tied at \u00a355. Another sign that investors reckon AstraZeneca has seen its US rival off -- shares in Pfizer are up over 2% in early pre-market trading in New York: 12:44 - PFIZER UP 2.2 PCT IN PREMARKET AFTER ASTRAZENECA REJECTS BUYOUT OFFER 12:44 - ASTRAZENECA U.S.-LISTED SHARES DOWN 10.4 PCT IN PREMARKET AFTER REJECTING PFIZER BUYOUT OFFER In London, Astra shares are still leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 11.6% at \u00a342.63 Business secretary Vince Cable has warned that the UK economy is being destabilised by booming house prices. \"It is a real, real, real worry\" that some people are taking out mortgages many times larger than their salaries, Cable added, according to politics editor Patrick Wintour. Here's the full story: Vince Cable: rising house prices destabilising economy Cable's comments were made last week, but have only just come to light. Yesterday, the Bank of England governor said the housing market was the single biggest threat to Britain, and this morning Rightmove reported the average London property had risen by \u00a380,000 so far this year. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, agrees that Pfizer is unlikely to make another bid for AstraZeneca, having been rebuffed three times*. He told clients: There is rarely a fourth attempt to dance in a takeover bid so based on the developments over the weekend, the probability for a deal is now very low. Despite Pfizer having spent a large amount of money and time, the signal seems clear from AstraZeneca's Board of Directors, UK politicians and mainstream media that this is a bad deal, and we see limited efforts from Pfizer going forward. Its shareholders will not appreciate a fourth attempt as it will inflate the valuation too much relative to deal risk. * Our timeline shows how Astra was rejected in January, mid-April, and now today. Back to AstraZeneca... Leading fund manager Neil Woodford, whose biggest shareholding in his \u00a34bn portfolio is AstraZeneca, is understood to be minded to reject Pfizer's latest offer. A formal statement from his new company, Woodford Asset Management, is expected later today. There's no let-up in the changes at the Co-operative Group. Its longest-standing director, Ben Reid, has just resigned, just days after the Co-op's AGM approved Lord Myners' proposals to reform the Group My colleague Jill Treanor has the story: The boss of the largest independent society, the Midcounties, Reid tendered his resignation on Monday morning following a tumultuous weekend when the members of the Group voted to reform the way the 150-year-old business is run. Reid had sat on the board for 14 years and was one of the five representatives of independent societies to have boardroom seats as a result of their 22% share holding in the Group. Another 15 seats are currently held for representatives of the regional boards whose 8m members control 78% of the Group. Reid had first indicating his wish to leave around the start of the year but has now resigned following the unanimous decision to adopt reforms linked to the Myners proposals, which would tear up the existing boardroom structure. Here's the full story. Myners had ripped into the Co-op's board in his report, saying that directors were sorely lacking in the skills and experiences needed to run the company. David Cameron has now weighed in, saying that the government remains neutral over Pfizer's bid to buy AstraZeneca, and is still talking to both companies to get the best outcome for Britain. He was speaking to the BBC. Here's the key quotes: \"This is a matter for the companies to resolve themselves\". \"The government quite rightly should be neutral in this. What we should do though is always be engaged with both companies - as we have been - to try and make sure that whatever the outcome, British science, British job, British manufacturing, that they get a proper and deserved attention.\" There's no way Pfizer can raise its offer again without getting AstraZeneca onside first, reckons my colleague Sean Farrell who has been checking the situation with City experts: Richard Marwood's criticism of AstraZeneca is particularly interesting, as AXA is its third-largest investor with a 4.5% stake. Jupiter, another firm who voiced concerns this morning, only holds 0.5% of Astra. AstraZeneca isn't the only company making news this morning - here's a quick summary of the other big stories: Ryanair has promised that its customer service is improving, after posting a disappointing drop in profits this morning RightMove has reported that the average London house price has jumped by \u00a380,000 so far this year, or around three times the average national wage. Deutsche Bank has told analysts that its \u20ac8bn capital injection will help it resist \"unforeseen challenges\", having tapped several investors including Qatar for funds. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \"rogue trader\", Jeroen Kerviel, has turned himself into French authorities to begin his three-year jail sentence, for costing his former employer \u20ac4.9bn through unauthorised trades. AXA's Richard Marwood is the latest investor to go public with his disappointment over AstraZeneca's decision -- he's told ITV that rejection wasn't in shareholders' interests: Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has applauded the AstraZeneca board for its stance on Pfizer: Well played the board of AstraZeneca. It took a position, argued the merits of a standalone strategy, and has turned down Pfizer's final offer of \u00a355 before any weak-willed fund managers could start muttering their objections. Boards of directors are meant to display independence of mind and backbone. This is a rare occasion when one has. It is too soon to declare this battle over definitively, but the 14% plunge in AZ's share price says Pfizer requires something extraordinary to happen to get back into the game. Here's the full piece: Just say no to drug giants - AstraZeneca did the right thing Here's the full quotes from disgruntled Jupiter fund manager, Alastair Gunn: \"We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer\u2019s latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer on the details of the offer to assess the opportunities that a combined entity could bring.\" \"There now seems little room left to manoeuvre with Pfizer having ruled out a hostile bid. We will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the AstraZeneca board over the way the bid process has been handled up to now.\" City firm Jupiter Asset Management has just gone public with its disappointment with AstraZeneca's board: From the Reuters terminal: 10:50 - JUPITER FUND MANAGER ALASTAIR GUNN SAYS \"DISAPPOINTED\" WITH ASTRAZENECA REJECTION OF PFIZER BID 10:52 - JUPITER FUND MANAGER ALASTAIR GUNN: \"WE WILL BE EXPRESSING OUR DISSATISFACTION TO THE ASTRAZENECA BOARD OVER THE WAY THE BID PROCESS HAS BEEN HANDLED\" Sounds like chairman Johansson and CEO Pascal Soriot have some tough conversations ahead, having rejected Pfizer's offer to pay \u00a369bn for their company (it's currently being valued at \u00a353bn) Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, has now issued a formal response to this morning's developments: \"Labour and others have been clear from the outset that if this potential takeover is found not to be in the best interests of British science, jobs and industry it should not proceed - so AstraZeneca's move today to reject Pfizer's final bid is welcome.\" \"While Labour was standing up for British jobs and British science, David Cameron and his ministers were cheerleading for a takeover bid where one of the primary motivations was financial engineering - cited by the AstraZeneca board as one of the execution risks justifying rejection of the bid. \"Ultimately it is for the shareholders to determine, but it is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs. Pfizer has said today that it will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on this promise. \"Where David Cameron and his government have failed to act, the next Labour government will act to introduce a strengthened public interest test to better protect Britain's science base.\" The Unite union has urged AstraZeneca shareholders to support the board's decision, and resist the temptation for a \"quick buck\". Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said investors should \"stand firm and look to the long term\" (despite being pretty disappointed this morning): The company has a long term plan and we would urge shareholders to back the workforce and the board. The latest offer from Pfizer still raises more questions than it answers. It would not only destabilise AstraZenca, but undermine the UK\u2019s science and research base and put a jewel in the Britain\u2019s manufacturing crown at risk. Reuters has also been speaking to some of AstraZeneca's largest shareholders - and confirms that some of them are unhappy (as we reported at 9.50am) Here's a flavour: \"We are extremely disappointed with the turn of events at Astra today,\" said one - a fund manager at a top 10 investor in AstraZeneca after the company rebuffed a raised takeover offer of \u00a355 a share, worth around \u00a370bn ($118bn). \"We do not think the Astra management have done a good job on behalf of shareholders. We had already urged Astra to engage in discussions with Pfizer,\" added the fund manager on condition of anonymity, as his firm had not authorised him to speak publicly. A second AstraZeneca shareholder within the 40 largest investors in the company said surprise at the rejected offer was widespread among his peers. \"I thought at 55 [pounds] they\u2019d say 'lets open the books and chat' so I think large numbers of shareholders out there will be disappointed,\" the second shareholder said. More here: Shareholders disappointed by AstraZeneca rejection of Pfizer But as The Times's Juliet Samuel points out, investors did have the chance to sell their shares before this morning: Analysts at Credit Suisse reckon that Pfizer could still tweak its 'final' offer, even if Takeover Code rules mean it can't raise it. They say Pfizer has the right to \"\"introduce other forms of consideration and/or vary the mix of consideration\", which could mean paying a larger percentage in cash. Credit Suisse says: \"We believe a further cash element would be possible and still meet the conditions of no increase in the overall price and still meet the US tax inversion rules. The bid is now effectively in the hands of shareholders. Savvas Neophytou of Panmure Gordon reckons there is wriggle room for Pfizer to bid more (because it has technically made a proposal, not a final offer. Neophytou says that Pfizer could be tempted towards AstraZeneca's minimum acceptable bid of almost \u00a359 per share: Will pressure from shareholders push the two sides towards a deal at around \u00a357.00? This is an attractive offer. We expect shareholders to press AstraZeneca to accept this new offer but management will likely want to resist so Pfizer would need to increase its offer one last time. Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, flags up that Astra's rejection has sent the bluechip shares index sliding: In mid-morning trading the FTSE 100 is firmly in the red, down 40 points, hit by the latest twist in the AstraZeneca/Pfizer saga. All attention is focused on AstraZeneca this morning, as the shares dive 14% following the decision of the firm to spurn Pfizer\u2019s advance. Such a big move in a weighty stock like Astra is bound to leave the index floundering but it is merely a symptom of a wider problem, namely that the market remains directionless after the highs of last week. As reported earlier, Josh Raymond of City Index thinks Pfizer will walk away from the bid now, but could be back: Even if Pfizer does walk away, I would expect them to still stalk AstraZeneca and wait for a moment of board weakness to pounce again in the future. The Pfizer bid has been a hot potato in Westminster, with the UK government accused of acting like a cheerleader for the US firm - so we shouldn't be surprised that insiders are saying little, so far anyway: Our timeline shows how the battle for AstraZeneca actually began last November, when Pfizer CEO Ian Read suggests the two companies should talk. Six months later, Read found himself being quizzed by MPs.... Pfizer's battle to buy AstraZeneca \u2013 timeline So how much have AstraZeneca investors lost? By my reckoning, around \u00a315bn. Last night the company was valued at almost \u00a361bn -- this morning's double-digit tumble has wiped around \u00a36.5bn off its value. But that's compared to Friday's closing price of \u00a348 per share. Pfizer was offering to pay \u00a355 (in a mixture of cash and its own shares), the equivalent of another \u00a38.5bn. So in total, Astra's shareholders would be some \u00a315bn better off, on paper, if their board had accepted Pfizer's bid. AstraZeneca shares are inching back, slightly - now down 10.8% at \u00a343.02 each. One of AstraZeneca's biggest shareholders has told the Guardian that the AZ board has committed the single biggest case of shareholder value destruction ever. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: A quick recap if you're just joining us: Pfizer's bid to take control of AstraZeneca, which would have been the biggest ever foreign takeover of a UK firm, appears to be over.... for now at least. Shares in AstraZeneca have tumbled 13% this morning, close to the company's value before Pfizer went public with its ambitions. AstraZeneca told the City early this morning it had rejected Pfizer's \"final\" offer of \u00a355 per share, which was made late last night. Chairman Leif Johansson said the \u00a369bn bid undervalued Astra, and also threatened to disrupt its pipeline of life-saving medicines. He said: \"We have rejected Pfizer's Final Proposal because it is inadequate and would present significant risks for shareholders, while also having serious consequences for the Company, our employees and the life-sciences sector in the UK, Sweden and the US.\" Johansson also claimed Pfizer has been driven by the prospect of cost savings and tax minimisation, adding: \"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case. The Board is firm in its conviction as to the appropriate terms to recommend to shareholders.\" But Johansson also revealed that AstraZeneca would have considered talking to Pfizer if it had bumped its bid up to almost \u00a359 per share. Under the Takeover Panel Code, Pfizer cannot raise last night's 'final' bid of \u00a355/shares again. The opposition Labour party have welcomed Astra's decision. Shadow business minister Chuka Umunna says it is the right decision for the company and the country. Sweden's finance minister also urged AZ shareholders to be cautious about accepting Pfizer's offer. Astra's chairman admitted this morning that he doesn't know for sure whether Pfizer's bid is really over, but 'believes them' when they say \u00a355/share is their final offer. City analyst Josh Raymond predicts that Pfizer will walk away, but could table a new bid if AstraZeneca hits trouble in future. He said: Pfizer now has very few options and is expected to walk away from the deal. The chances of AstraZeneca remaining out of Pfizer\u2019s hands I would now rate at 90%. If Pfizer walks away on, or before 26 May it cannot bid again until 26 November.... Newsflash on Reuters: Sweden's finance minister, Anders Borg, has urged Astra shareholders to be 'careful' about accepting Pfizer's offer: SWEDISH FIN MIN BORG SAYS EVEN AT IMPROVED LEVELS ASTRAZENECA SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT ACCEPTING PFIZER BID The Swedish government has been critical of Pfizer in recent weeks, saying it has a track record of aggressive cost cutting after aquisitions. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, believes Pfizer will now walk away from AstraZeneca, but could 'stalk' the company and table a bid in future. He points out that Astra's board has effectively named its price -- \u00a359 per share -- by revealing this morning that it wanted a 10% premium to the \u00a353.50 tabled over the weekend. Raymond says: AstraZeneca have rejected Pfizer\u2019s final offer of \u00a355 a share with a sweetened cash incentive, however, in doing so the board of AstraZeneca have also highlighted the price they would be willing to do business, \u00a359 a share. This is a quite staggering level, which would represent a near 60% premium on AstraZeneca\u2019s shares price before rumours first emerged of Pfizer\u2019s imminent bid. Pfizer now has very few options and is expected to walk away from the deal. The chances of AstraZeneca remaining out of Pfizer\u2019s hands I would now rate at 90%. The slump in Astra's share price this morning suggests many other analysts agree. But Raymond adds, this may not be the end of the story: Even if Pfizer does walk away, I would expect them to still stalk AstraZeneca and wait for a moment of board weakness to pounce again in the future. If Pfizer does walk away, it can't bid again for six months. Aberdeen Asset Management, one of AstraZeneca's largest investors, reckons Pfizer \"could do better\" than its 'final' \u00a355 per share offer. Chief Investment Officer Anne Richards told BBC radio that: \"The price is finely balanced.\" \"I think it's a good price that's on the table at the moment but probably they could do better than that.\" Did Pfizer offer a fair price for AstraZeneca? It was hard to evaluate the bid, given the uncertainty over how much Pfizer could trim off its tax bill by redomiciling in Britain. Pfizer's reluctance to discuss its cost-cutting plans in detail also added to the opaqueness. But last night's \u00a355 per share offer was a chunky 44% premium on Astra's price in mid-April, before the City got wind of a potential deal. Helen Thomas of the WSJ tweets that Pfizer's offer did look tasty to many investors, given pharma companies are under pressure to consolidate Helen also reckons Pfizer can't raise its bid again, for at least six months anyway. More tweets from Labour's shadow business minister, Chuka Umunna, hailed Astra's board for taking the long-term view: AstraZeneca's sliding share price (still down 13%) has helped to knock the FTSE 100 into the red. It's down 32 points this morning at 6822; away from the 14-year high hit last week. FastFT flags up that AstraZeneca's chairman appears a little uncertain about the situation. Asked if this is the end of the battle, Leif Johansson replied: I have no idea, this has been going on for quite some time, and in very deep engagement over the whole of the weekend. Pfizer now says this is the final offer - I have to believe them at what they say. As explained at 7.44am, it's not clear how Pfizer can raise its offer again under City rules This charts shows how AstraZeneca's shares have tumbled right back to their level in late April, after Pfizer made its first approach (but before it raised it). That suggests the City sees little chance of a shareholder rebellion to force Astra's board to the negotiating table. AstraZeneca shares have tumbled 13% at the start of trading to \u00a341.90 per share. That's down from \u00a348 on Friday night, as investors react to its decision to rebuff Pfizer's final, \u00a355 per share, offer this morning. Astra chairman Johansson also dubbed Pfizer's proposal \"controversial\" --probably a reference to the company's plans to shift its tax base to the UK from the US. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson insisted his board were right to reject Pfizer: Their offer is too low, we have better opportunity to create value for shareholders... in an undisrupted way. Chuka Umnuna, shadow business minister, says AstraZeneca's board have done the right thing for their company, and the UK. Trading on the London stock market begins at 8am, so we'll have the City's verdict soon.... AstraZeneca shares closed at \u00a348.23 on Friday night. They were worth \u00a335 in January when Pfizer made its first, quiet, approach, and \u00a338 in April when its ambitions were made public. Sam Fazeli, Bloomberg's pharmaceuticals correspondent, sees little chance that AstraZeneca's investors will rebel and demand talks with Pfizer. He explains that shareholders could go to the company and say 'you've made your decision, but now we'd like you to talk to them'. However: I think that is unlikely, as it would be a vote of no confidence in the company's management. So what happens now? Under City rules, because Pfizer said its \u00a355 per share offer is \"final\" it cannot raise it again, unless there's a material change in circumstances (the first bullet point at the bottom of Pfizer's last offer makes this point). Last night, Pfizer asked AstraZeneca shareholders \" to urge the AstraZeneca board to begin substantive engagement with Pfizer\" before May 26 -- when Pfizer must walk away unless talks are underway. But Astra's board has made its decision this morning -- the question is whether its shareholders accept it.... You can read AstraZeneca's official statement to shareholders here: ASTRAZENECA BOARD REJECTS PFIZER'S FINAL PROPOSAL AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson also criticised Pfizer for being motivated by the prospect of cutting its tax bill, by shifting its tax base to the UK. \"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation. From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case. The Board is firm in its conviction as to the appropriate terms to recommend to shareholders.\" Johansson concludes by reiterating the disruption that a merger would have caused: \"We have rejected Pfizer's Final Proposal because it is inadequate and would present significant risks for shareholders, while also having serious consequences for the Company, our employees and the life-sciences sector in the UK, Sweden and the US.\" Now this is interesting -- AstraZeneca told Pfizer on Friday night that its minimum acceptable price was around \u00a359 per share (or around \u00a374bn in total, I think). Last night's final offer of\u00a355 per share is obviously short of that: Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca explains: \"Pascal Soriot, Marc Dunoyer and I had a lengthy discussion with Pfizer over the weekend about the proposal Pfizer made on Friday evening at a value of \u00a353.50 per share. During this discussion, Pfizer said that it could consider only minor improvements in the financial terms of the Friday Proposal. In response, we indicated, even assuming that other key aspects of any proposal had been satisfactory, that the price at which the Board of AstraZeneca would be prepared to provide a recommendation would have to be more than 10% above the level contained in Pfizer's Friday Proposal. The Final Proposal is a minor improvement which continues to fall short of the Board's view of value and has been rejected.\" AstraZeneca says it rejected Pfizer's \u00a369bn offer because of the risk a takeover would pose to its pharmaceutical work, and the uncertainty it would create, as well as on price grounds. The company says last night's Final Proposal \"falls short of AstraZeneca's value as an independent science-led company. It adds: AstraZeneca has excellent momentum in the delivery of its clearly defined strategy, underpinning the Board's confidence in the Company's long term revenue targets and profitability Pfizer's proposals bring uncertainty and risks for AstraZeneca shareholders Last week, AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot had warned MPs that life-saving drugs could be delayed by a takeover. Breaking: AstraZeneca has just told the City that it has rejected Pfizer's increased offer of \u00a355 per share, declaring that it fails to recognise its full value. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The City is on tenterhooks this morning, after Pfizer raised its takeover offer for AstraZeneca last night, and sweetened the cash component of the deal. The US firm is now offering \u00a355 per share for Astra, valuing it at \u00a369.4bn. Pfizer also warned that the improved offer is \"final and cannot be increased\" -- meaning a deal that has captured the headlines for weeks could soon be over... Here's our story on Pfizer's offer: Pfizer raises stakes with final AstraZeneca takeover approach In the eurozone, we'll be tracking events in Greece after last weekend's local elections gave both coalition partners a bruising. In the economics space, Chinese house price growth has slowed again. We'll also be watching Ryanair, which has reported its first drop in annual profits in five years this morning. It also warned that fares could come under pressure this coming winter - bad for its profit margin, but good news for consumers..... I'll be tracking all the main events through the day",

Elliott was initially advised by OpCapita, the investment firm that controversially profited from the collapse of electricals chain Comet, but Gibbs said it was not currently involved with running the business. Game is targeting a free float of at least 35% with \u00a312m to be raised from the sale of new shares. Renamed Game Digital, the company made a profit before financial charges of \u00a347m on sales of \u00a3815.7m in the year to 25 January. The streamlined group has 560 stores in the UK and Spain compared with 874 in 2012. The turnaround was boosted by the arrival of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles last year. Gibbs said the flotation was an opportunity to bring \"long term investors\" on to its share register. The retailer has no debt and a new \u00a350m credit line with HSBC in place. The fresh start would also help suppliers, who at present can obtain only limited credit insurance. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said the \"remarkable\" recovery in Game's financial performance had been helped by the upswing in the video games cycle. \"This is obviously a very cyclical business, as investors know to their cost,\" said Bubb. \"This is no doubt taken into account in the mooted \u00a3400m valuation.\"",

    "webTitle": "Credit Suisse pleads guilty to criminal charges in US tax evasion settlement", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Credit Suisse Group has pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it helped Americans evade taxes, becoming the first bank in more than a decade to admit to a crime in the US. It will now pay a long-expected fine of $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn). \u201cThis case shows that no financial institution no matter its size or global reach is above the law,\u201d said the attorney general, Eric Holder. He said the years-long investigation had uncovered evidence of an \u201cextensive and wide-ranging\u201d conspiracy to hide taxes from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the bank\u2019s involvement in it. \u201cThe bank went to elaborate lengths to shield itself, its employees, and the tax cheats it served from accountability for their criminal actions. They subverted disclosure requirements, destroyed bank records, and concealed transactions involving undeclared accounts by limiting withdrawal amounts and using offshore credit and debit cards to repatriate funds. They failed to take even the most basic steps to ensure compliance with tax laws,\u201d said Holder. Holder said the bank helped account holders deceive the IRS by concealing assets and income in illegal, undeclared bank accounts. \u201cThese secret offshore accounts were held in the names of sham entities and foundations. This conspiracy spanned decades. In the case of at least one wholly owned subsidiary, the practice of using sham entities to conceal funds began more than a century ago,\u201d said Holder. He said hundreds of Credit Suisse employees, including at the manager level, \u201cconspired to help tax cheats dodge US taxes\u201d. Brady Dougan, Credit Suisse\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cWe deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement. The US cross-border matter represented the most significant and longstanding regulatory and litigation issue for Credit Suisse. Having this matter fully resolved is an important step forward for us. He said there had been \u201cno material impact\u201d on the bank\u2019s business resulting from the heightened public attention and the bank would \u201cnow focus on the future and give our full attention to executing our strategy\u201d. The bank will pay a total of $1.8bn in the form of a fine of over $1.13bn and nearly $670m in restitution to the IRS. It will also pay the New York State department of financial services a record $715m and another $100m to the Federal Reserve. The deal comes after a Senate panel in February concluded Credit Suisse recruited for over 22,000 US customers with assets of $10bn-$12bn, the vast majority of which were hidden from US authorities. Pressure has been mounting on the Swiss banks in recent months. In March, Andreas Bachmann, one of six former Credit Suisse bankers indicted on charges of helping US clients hide $4bn in assets, pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. In April, Josef Dorig, founder of a Swiss fund, pleaded guilty in the same case and implicated several other Credit Suisse bankers. Criminal convictions against major financial institutions are rare. The financial services industry has worried that charging a bank with a crime could shut down its entire business. The last global bank to plead guilty in the US was Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, which in 2004 admitted making false statements to the Federal Reserve. In 2002, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice related to its auditing of Enron, the energy firm that imploded in a massive accounting scandal in 2001. That ruling was reversed on appeal but was enough to destroy the company. Regulators have subsequently been wary of criminal convictions of holding companies and have instead reached plea agreements with banks including HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and UBS or have extracted guilty pleas from subsidiaries. Holder said the agreement had been struck \u201cin close coordination with the bank\u2019s financial regulators\u201d because \u201ccriminal charges involving a financial institution have the potential to trigger serious follow-on actions by regulatory agencies.\u201d He said the bank would now \u201cmove forward\u201d although he said there were other ongoing investigations. The case has led to calls for the resignation of Dougan and the chairman of Credit Suisse, Urs Rohner. Dougan, 54, is the first American to serve as sole CEO of Credit Suisse and was appointed to the top job in 2007 after leading the investment bank. He is one of the few global bank bosses to have survived the financial crisis and the scandals that followed. On Sunday, Christoph Blocher, billionaire industrialist and vice-president of the rightwing Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP), told Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag that Dougan and Rohner should step down. \u201cIn my opinion, the CEO as well as the chairman of the board must go in order to save the bank,\u201d Blocher told the Schweiz am Sonntag. His comments come after calls for Dougan\u2019s resignation from Switzerland\u2019s left-wing Social Democrats. While Credit Suisse is close to finalizing a deal, the Justice Department is still pushing for an admission of criminal wrongdoing from Italy\u2019s BNP Paribas, which is accused of having violated US sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Sudan between 2002 and 2009.",

Bankers and other advisers collected \u00a3240m advising on Kraft's \u00a312bn takeover of Cadbury in 2010, which works out at 2% of the deal.</p> <p>Hahn said Pfizer's banking advisers would be feeling pretty sore because investment banking adviser contracts are generally structured so that without a deal there is no fee.</p> <p>\"There'll be some senior guy in New York, it could have easily cost him several million,\" Hahn said.</p> <p>One banker potentially nursing such a loss is Fares Noujaim, who as Bank of America Merril Lynch executive vice president was Pfizer's lead banker.</p> <p>The collapse of the deal is a rare blot on the Lebanese-American's dealmaking copybook. He was instrumental in Vodafone's $130bn sale of its 45% stake in the Verizon Wireless mobile phone company to Verizon Communications, and has advised on deals worth a total of $450bn.</p> <p>Other rainmakers losing out on a bumper potential payday include Andrew Mee, Bank of America Merril Lynch's head of international mergers &amp; acquisitions, and fellow senior bankers at the same firm Michael Findlay and Geoff Iles.</p> <p>Pfizer was also advised by Guggenheim Partners, an investment banking advisory service founded by the great-grandson of Solomon Guggenheim, as well as by JP Morgan.</p> <p>Hahn said the bankers would be extremely angry that months of long nights and weekends spent working on the deal had gone to waste. \"Of course, there will be huge disappointment, but it's a high risk game,\" he said. \"There's no question it [pay] is about success.\"</p> <p>He said it was unlikely that the bankers would have already spent the larger bonuses they expected to collect as a result of the deal. \"The one lesson I learnt as a investment banker is you don't spend the money until it's in your account.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca's bankers \u2013 Robey Warshaw, Evercore Partners, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2013 will collect fees for defending the company from Pfizer's approaches, but could have picked up more cash if Pfizer had taken a hostile bid direct to Astra shareholders.</p> <p>Alongside the bankers there will be lawyers, accountants and PR people who could have collected from the deal.</p> <p>Hahn pointed out that Pfizer's complex and controversial plan to move to the UK to save millions in tax would have been an extra big moneyspinner for accountants and lawyers.</p> <p>London's two biggest PR firms \u2013 Brunswick (which acts for Pfizer) and RLM Finsbury (working for AstraZeneca) \u2013 will also lose out from ongoing work promoting or criticising the deal.</p> <p>A senior PR executive at a different firm said Brunswick chairman Alan Parker would be \"devastated\" at the collapse of the deal. \"The contract would have been in the high hundreds of thousands into seven figures,\" the PR man said. \"They will be devastated by this, it would have made up a meaningful part of the bonus \u2013 it would be the difference between getting a Ferrari or not.\"</p>",

Peter Hahn, a former managing director at Citigroup and now finance lecturer at Cass Business School, said advisers typically collect fees worth 0.5% of the deal, which would have worked out at \u00a3345m if AstraZeneca had accepted Pfizer's last \u00a355-a-share offer. However, the fees could have clocked up even higher if the takeover battle had become even more contentious. Bankers and other advisers collected \u00a3240m advising on Kraft's \u00a312bn takeover of Cadbury in 2010, which works out at 2% of the deal. Hahn said Pfizer's banking advisers would be feeling pretty sore because investment banking adviser contracts are generally structured so that without a deal there is no fee. \"There'll be some senior guy in New York, it could have easily cost him several million,\" Hahn said. One banker potentially nursing such a loss is Fares Noujaim, who as Bank of America Merril Lynch executive vice president was Pfizer's lead banker. The collapse of the deal is a rare blot on the Lebanese-American's dealmaking copybook. He was instrumental in Vodafone's $130bn sale of its 45% stake in the Verizon Wireless mobile phone company to Verizon Communications, and has advised on deals worth a total of $450bn. Other rainmakers losing out on a bumper potential payday include Andrew Mee, Bank of America Merril Lynch's head of international mergers &amp; acquisitions, and fellow senior bankers at the same firm Michael Findlay and Geoff Iles. Pfizer was also advised by Guggenheim Partners, an investment banking advisory service founded by the great-grandson of Solomon Guggenheim, as well as by JP Morgan. Hahn said the bankers would be extremely angry that months of long nights and weekends spent working on the deal had gone to waste. \"Of course, there will be huge disappointment, but it's a high risk game,\" he said. \"There's no question it [pay] is about success.\" He said it was unlikely that the bankers would have already spent the larger bonuses they expected to collect as a result of the deal. \"The one lesson I learnt as a investment banker is you don't spend the money until it's in your account.\" AstraZeneca's bankers \u2013 Robey Warshaw, Evercore Partners, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2013 will collect fees for defending the company from Pfizer's approaches, but could have picked up more cash if Pfizer had taken a hostile bid direct to Astra shareholders. Alongside the bankers there will be lawyers, accountants and PR people who could have collected from the deal. Hahn pointed out that Pfizer's complex and controversial plan to move to the UK to save millions in tax would have been an extra big moneyspinner for accountants and lawyers. London's two biggest PR firms \u2013 Brunswick (which acts for Pfizer) and RLM Finsbury (working for AstraZeneca) \u2013 will also lose out from ongoing work promoting or criticising the deal. A senior PR executive at a different firm said Brunswick chairman Alan Parker would be \"devastated\" at the collapse of the deal. \"The contract would have been in the high hundreds of thousands into seven figures,\" the PR man said. \"They will be devastated by this, it would have made up a meaningful part of the bonus \u2013 it would be the difference between getting a Ferrari or not.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group is facing further boardroom upheaval after the resignation of its longest-standing director. The head of the Midcounties Co-operative, Ben Reid, tendered his resignation on Monday morning after a tumultuous weekend in which members of the group voted to change the way the 150-year-old business is run. Reid had been on the board for 14 years and was one of the five representatives of independent societies to have boardroom seats as a result of their 22% shareholding in the group. Another 15 seats are held for representatives of the regional boards, whose 8 million members control the other 78%. Reid first indicated his wish to resign around the start of the year, but did not leave then because the board of the Midcounties \u2013 the largest independent society in the co-operative movement \u2013 asked him to remain on the board during the reform process. Midcounties was, initially, one of the fiercest critics of the plans for reform drawn up by Lord Myners, until changes were made to his proposals to clarify the position of independent societies. With the reforms under way, Reid was able to resign. \"The vote was unanimous on Saturday. It's a new phase now. It's for other people to pick up,\" he said. Myners sat on the board until last weekend's AGM in Manchester, when he stepped down formally after a five-month stint marked by clashes over his proposals. Reid was the subject of personal criticism by Myners during a hearing with MPs. The former City minister said it was astonishing that Reid was still on the board after sitting on the Co-op bank's audit committee for three years during which a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was uncovered. Reid has previously said it was a shame that the issue became personal. Myners said: \"He leads Midcounties with great distinction but he chaired the bank's audit committee for three years. In my view his continued position on the group board was untenable.\" Patrick Gray, president of the Midcounties, said Reid had represented independent societies on the group's board with \"energy and integrity\". Reid intends to focus on the Midcounties, the first independent society to surpass \u00a31bn of sales after reporting a 24% rise in revenues to \u00a31.2bn. \"There's absolutely no doubt that all this publicity has had an impact on our trading performance. It's pretty critical I get back to doing my day job,\" he said. Reid had been prepared to take the chief executive post at the Co-op group after the resignation of the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, in March. He said he did not believe such a move was necessary now. \"That moment has probably passed now and things will move on,\" said Reid. The old-style Co-op board now has three vacant seats \u2013 two from the regional boards and the one being vacated by Reid \u2013 as well as the role Myners held as an independent director. The board, however, is expected to alter radically if the proposals outlined by Myners are adopted in full. Under that template, no current members would remain and they would be replaced by an independent chair, about seven professional directors and two directors from the Co-op management team. While members of the Co-op voted last weekend to adopt reforms, discussions have begun about adapting the ideas put forward by Myners, with the aim of appeasing the regional boards, which would lose their presence on the group-wide board. Independent societies felt they were not given great enough representation when Myners first published an outline of his proposals following the resignation of Sutherland, who quit following the leaking of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal.

Now it is up to Astra's shareholders to decide.</p> <p>Another company in the sector often mooted as a bid target is <strong>Shire</strong>. Its shares are up 43p at \u00a333.09, but this is less to do with speculation and more on news the company will submit an application in the first quarter of 2015 to US regulators for its lifitegrast drug as a treatment for dry eye disease.</p> <p>Elsewhere banks have fallen back after Deutsche Bank unveiled an \u20ac8bn fundraising to boost its capital base. <strong>Barclays</strong> is down 5.25p at 236.3p, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has slipped 4.3p to 318.5p and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is 0.76p lower 72.71p. A new standards body for UK banks is due to be launched later this year, with the aim of improving banking practices. Meanwhile analysts at Jefferies believe new banks entering the market could prove a real challenge for the incumbents:</p> <blockquote> Our analysis of the UK banking market concludes that the utility banks [Lloyds, RBS, Santander UK, Barclays] will cede four points of market share to the challenger space, opening up a \u00a3100bn loan pool with \u00a35bn of revenue potential.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading lower after last week's 14 year highs, with takeover bids unusually pushing the market down and banks under pressure. Vodafone has fallen 2.6p to 214.55p after AT&amp;T paid $49bn for US satellite television business DirecTV. AT&amp;T has long been tipped as a predator for Vodafone, but this latest deal by the US group seems to make that prospect less likely, at least in the short term. Meanwhile AstraZeneca is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 641.5p or 13% at \u00a341.82, after it rejected Pfizer's final \u00a355 a share offer. Now it is up to Astra's shareholders to decide. Another company in the sector often mooted as a bid target is Shire. Its shares are up 43p at \u00a333.09, but this is less to do with speculation and more on news the company will submit an application in the first quarter of 2015 to US regulators for its lifitegrast drug as a treatment for dry eye disease. Elsewhere banks have fallen back after Deutsche Bank unveiled an \u20ac8bn fundraising to boost its capital base. Barclays is down 5.25p at 236.3p, Royal Bank of Scotland has slipped 4.3p to 318.5p and Lloyds Banking Group is 0.76p lower 72.71p. A new standards body for UK banks is due to be launched later this year, with the aim of improving banking practices. Meanwhile analysts at Jefferies believe new banks entering the market could prove a real challenge for the incumbents: Our analysis of the UK banking market concludes that the utility banks [Lloyds, RBS, Santander UK, Barclays] will cede four points of market share to the challenger space, opening up a \u00a3100bn loan pool with \u00a35bn of revenue potential. In seizing this, we believe challengers could nearly quadruple their market share.

      "bodyText": "French rogue trader J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel ended a two-day standoff with French justice on Sunday by announcing that he would walk back across the Italian border into France where police were expected to arrest him. Kerviel, accompanied by supporters and a media scrum, had spent the last two days in Ventimiglia only a few hundred yards from the border. He threatened to remain in Italy in defiance of a deadline to return to France, where he is to serve a three-year jail sentence. French judicial authorities warned on Sunday that he would be declared a fugitive and would face arrest on an international warrant if he failed to show up at a police station in the French border town of Menton by midnight. Kerviel, at the heart of one of the world's biggest rogue trading scandals, was convicted of forgery and breach of trust in 2010 over his trading fraud which cost his bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u20ac4.9bn. Ending the suspense about his intentions, Kerviel, 37, said: \"I'm going to have dinner with my friends \u2026 and then return to France.\" But he added that his bid to prove that his bosses had turned a blind eye to the fraud would go on. \"The fight will go on. Whatever happens, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and finance in general will continue to hear from me.\" Kerviel, 37, has spent the last two and a half months on a walk from Rome to Paris to draw attention to the \"tyranny\" of financial markets. He also had a brief meeting with Pope Francis.

      "body": "<p>French rogue trader J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel ended a two-day standoff with French justice on Sunday by announcing that he would walk back across the Italian border into France where police were expected to arrest him.</p> <p>Kerviel, accompanied by supporters and a media scrum, had spent the last two days in Ventimiglia only a few hundred yards from the border. He threatened to remain in Italy in defiance of a deadline to return to France, where he is to serve a three-year jail sentence.</p> <p>French judicial authorities warned on Sunday that he would be declared a fugitive and would face arrest on an international warrant if he failed to show up at a police station in the French border town of Menton by midnight. Kerviel, at the heart of one of the world's biggest rogue trading scandals, was convicted of forgery and breach of trust in 2010 over his trading fraud which cost his bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u20ac4.9bn.</p> <p>Ending the suspense about his intentions, Kerviel, 37, said: \"I'm going to have dinner with my friends \u2026 and then return to France.\" But he added that his bid to prove that his bosses had turned a blind eye to the fraud would go on. \"The fight will go on. Whatever happens, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and finance in general will continue to hear from me.\"</p> <p>Kerviel, 37, has spent the last two and a half months on a walk from Rome to Paris to draw attention to the \"tyranny\" of financial markets. He also had a brief meeting with Pope Francis. His lawyer, David Koubbi, returned to Paris on Sunday in the hope of negotiating an immunity deal for witnesses who according to Kerviel would testify in his favour. Kerviel initially said that he would remain in Italy \"waiting for the president to respond.\"</p> <p>But aides to President Francois Hollande said that there were \"no plans\" to meet with Kerviel's representatives, and Finance Minister Michel Sapin went on television to describe Kerviel as a \"crook\" who should serve out his sentence.
