      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers suffered a sharp slowdown last month as the Ukraine crisis showed the first signs of hitting the UK economy. A key monthly measure of business at Britain's factories hit a 14-month low, fanning fears that overall economic growth is tailing off after a strong first half to 2014. Manufacturing surveys from the eurozone, the UK's main trading partner, also painted a picture of deteriorating demand and shaken confidence on the continent. For the UK, news of pressure on exports deals a blow to government hopes of rebalancing the economy away from domestic consumer demand and towards more overseas trade. Bank of England data showed a big rise in lending to consumers in June, from \u00a3665m in the previous month to \u00a31.1bn, providing more support to those who warn the UK is still overly reliant on household spending. The manufacturing report also pushes back expectations of when interest rates will rise from their record low, with many analysts now expecting early 2015 as the most likely date for an increase. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI, a closely watched poll, showed factory output, orders and job creation had all come off recent highs. Export orders grew at the slowest pace for five months.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. Britain\u2019s economic recovery has taken a knock after growth across the country\u2019s factories slowed to the slowest rate in 14 months. Manufacturers reported a drop in the growth of output, and new orders. Although overseas demand was still rising, there are signs of a \u201cbroad-based\u201d slowdown in the industry. Job creation also slowed. And the signals from the eurozone have also been disappointing, with France\u2019s factory sector shrinking at a faster pace and Italy falling back into contraction. The UK manufacturing PMI fell to 52.5 in August, a sharp fall on last month\u2019s 54.8, although still above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Rob Dobson of Markit, which compiled the report, warned:\uf0a7 It is also becoming increasingly evident that UK industry is not immune to the impacts of rising geopolitical and global market uncertainty, especially when they affect economic growth and business confidence in our largest trading partner the eurozone. It is noticeable that where export orders were reported to have risen, companies mainly linked this to demand from North America, Asia and the Middle East, as opposed to our European partners. Analysts at Berenberg bank said the Ukraine crisis was clearly hurting Britain\u2019s factories, as well as those in the eurozone, saying: Russia\u2019s escalation of the conflict in Ukraine has taken a toll on the internationally exposed manufacturing sector, and that effect could yet worsen further in the coming months given recent confidence drops in the more directly exposed core European economies. Other economists warned that the UK economy looked less balanced, with consumer credit growing at a faster pace even as factory output slowed. The eurozone PMIs also showed that Europe\u2019s economy was slowing, with activity growth hitting a 13-month low. In other news... Germany has posted its first surplus since 1991, for the first six months of the year. The news that income outstripped borrowing adds to pressure on Berlin to do more to help the rest of Europe. Holger Sandte, an economist at Nordea Bank, says: \u201cIn other European countries the figures will give confirmation to those who expect more fiscal policy impetus from Germany,\u201d But finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has said that Europe needs tighter budget control, rather than a splurge of investment. Over in Greece, the government has downplayed hopes of a breakthrough on debt relief when negotiations with its lenders begins tomorrow.... ..and the PM has offered the hope of cutting unemployment once its recession finally ends. The ruble has hit fresh lows as the Ukraine crisis rumbled on, and EU leaders consider new sanctions; a ban on buying Russian sovereign debt is one option. While Brazil\u2019s factory has returned to modest growth, while Mexico\u2019s has grown at a faster pace. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to do it all again... Goodnight. GW Over in Greece, finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has been making strenuous efforts to lower expectations around the talks that begin with the country\u2019s creditors in Paris on Tuesday. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Gikas Hardouvelis emerged from yet another round of strategising insisting that Greece would not be giving its \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors any red-line ultimatums when negotiations begin in Paris on Tuesday. Instead, he said, the talks would focus on the plethora of structural reforms Athens\u2019 coalition government had implemented over the course of the summer. The \u201cprior actions\u201d were set as a precondition of Greece receiving it next instalment of \u20ac1bn in aid. Hardouvelis told reporters: \u201cWe are not imposing red lines\u201d. We have increased the speed of our work. The fact that we are meeting tomorrow forced us to work all of August and we have moved forward with many structural reforms. We will mostly discuss them, it will be a wide-ranging discussion \u2026. the bar has been raised. We have to bear in mind who the counterparties are. They are members of the International Monetary Fund, the (European) Commission, and the European Central Bank.\u201d As such, Hardouvelis said, the Troika could not impose political decisions (such as debt relief, for example) \u201cThey can only speak about the memorandum,\u201d Hardouvelis, said referring to the loan accord outlining the onerous terms of the financial aid package Greece agreed with lenders, adding: \u201cYou must understand their limits. They cannot speak politically.\u201d OK, the word on the wires is that the German finance minister is calling for tougher controls of national budgets, effectively enforcing tighter fiscal control across the eurozone: Or perhaps not... Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appears to be trolling the rest of the eurozone: Or perhaps he\u2019s just teeing up Germany to use its new budget surplus to tackle the problem.... The final PMI report of the day has just arrived, from Mexico, and its factory sector has grown at a faster rate in August. The Mexico manufacturing PMI rose to 52.1, from the nine-month low of 51.5 recorded in July. The survey shows that activity picked up thanks to increased sales volumes, new products, stronger demand from overseas, and increased hiring. The crisis gripping Portugal\u2019s Esp\u00edrito Santo conglomerate has taken another twist today. The WSJ reports that Goldman Sachs lent around $835m to Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo in July, when the troubles of its parent company were already making it hard to access funds. The cash was earmarked for projects such as a new oil refinery in Venezuela. Goldman had planned to make a big profit by selling the loan onto its clients, but ultimately found little appetite for the Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s debt after the scale of its financial problems became clear. In August, it was bailed out and split into a good bank and bad bank. Goldman reportedly sold some of the debt, eventually, at a loss, and is still holding the rest - which is worth less than it paid for it.... More here: Goldman Sachs Made Big Loan to Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo Shortly Before Collapse Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz (and formally of bond-trading giant Pimco), agrees that this morning\u2019s eurozone factory data shows the economy weakening: Over in Greece, the prime minister has vowed to make a dent in the country\u2019s perilously high jobless total. During a meeting of the government\u2019s employment council on Monday, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras suggested that three quarters of a million new jobs could eb created by the end of the decade. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: \u201cUnemployment is society\u2019s most insidious and tough enemy because it undermines the dreams of youth,\u201d Samaras said \u201cFor the first time in 24 quarters there is a projected GDP increase while there is a forecast for new 770,000 jobs by 2020,\u201d the conservative premier said. Samaras asked the members of the committee to fine tune their proposals ahead of their next meeting in October. Greece\u2019s jobless rate is currently 27.2%, more than twice the the eurozone average of 11.6%. There are currently around 3.5 million people in work, 1.3 million unemployed, and 3.3 million classed as \u2018inactive\u2019 (having dropped out of the labour force altogether). Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, flags up that Samaras has been holding a series of meetings today to hammer out Greece\u2019s strategy before meeting its lenders in Paris tomorrow. He used last weekend\u2019s EU summer to push European Commission president-elect Jean-Claude Juncker over the issue of debt relief for Greece. Another PMI report just landed, showing that Brazil\u2019s factory sector has returned to (modest) growth last month. Brazilian manufacturing PMI broke over the 50-point mark, which splits expansion from contraction, for the first time since March, rising to 50.2 from 49.1 in July. That\u2019s encouraging, given Brazil slipped into recession in the last quarter. HSBC, which compiled the report, suggests that Brazil\u2019s economy may have returned to normal after the disruption of the World Cup. But the economy still looks troubled: Andre Loes, chief economist for Brazil at HSBC, says: \u201cThe HSBC Brazil Manufacturing PMI index suggests that business activity improved modestly in August in what may have been a rebound following the disruptions caused by the FIFA World Cup. The headline PMI index rose from 49.1 in July to 50.2 in August \u2013 the first above-50 reading since March, on the back of a sizeable rebound in production. However, new orders remain flat relative to the last month, suggesting that the outlook for the sector remains weak.\u201d The slowdown in eurozone manufacturing growth has helped to push the main European markets into the red, on a generally tedious trading session. The Italian stock market is down almost 0.5%, after its factories reported an unwelcome drop in activity. France\u2019s CAC index is in the red too, while the German and UK markets are hovering. And the early rally on the Moscow stock market has evaporated after rumours emerged that EU leaders are considering banning Europeans from buying Russian sovereign debt. Analysts at M&amp;G\u2019s Bond Vigilantes arm point out that Germany has reached a surplus despite weak growth in the last six months: There\u2019s also chatter that the new sanctions on Russia could hit its high-tech gas supply industry. Interesting... EU leaders are going to consider a ban on Europeans buying Russian government bonds, according to a Reuters newswire snap. A reminder of how labour\u2019s share of the pie has been nibbled away since the post-war days: Hats off to James Ashton, executive editor at the Evening Standard and the Independent, for bagging the first interview with Tesco\u2019s new boss, Dave Lewis. Lewis, who started at Tesco this morning, mainly focuses on his work at Unilever (launching Dove in the UK, making shampoo more glamorous, etc), but there\u2019s a few hints about his style. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he shoots across the table, pleasantries aside. No wonder Lewis has a reputation for putting the customer first. He is slick, but later comes a confession. \u201cI am wonderfully na\u00efve about some of the stuff that is going to come but that is fine, it has served me well up to now,\u201d he says, vowels flat from his Yorkshire upbringing. \u201cI will do what I have to do tomorrow in the same way that I did things yesterday.\u201d Lewis concedes that he\u2019s never done anything quite like this before; indeed, that\u2019s the attraction: \u201cI needed to find out for myself whether I can lead a whole business,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cSome people think that is crazy given some of the jobs I have done but actually I don\u2019t think you know whether you can truly lead a business until you sit in that seat.\u201d Tesco shares are still down 1.6% today, after major shareholder Harris Associates confirmed it had cut its stake (details here) Back to Germany, and the eurozone\u2019s largest economy has officially posted its first surplus since reunification, for the first six months of this year. The Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, reported that Germany\u2019s general government achieved a surplus of \u20ac16.1bn in January-June, or around +1.1% of GDP. That\u2019s the combined spending and borrowing of central government, state government, local government and social security funds. Destatis said that Germany\u2019s general government has benefited from \u201ca very good employment situation\u201d. Here\u2019s the details: Germany\u2019s central government achieved a surplus of \u20ac4bn, for the first time since 1991. State government borrowed \u20ac200m. Local government had a surplus of \u20ac5.3bn And the social security funds enjoy a surplus of \u20ac7.1bn This result surely puts more pressure on Berlin to boost spending to help the rest of the eurozone. Angela Merkel, though, has declared that any additional spending would be aimed at \u2018investment\u2019: The german chancellor told a news conference this morning that: \u201cFirst we have to see if the economic forecasts remain as they are. If we have more money, if in doubt we will spend it in the area of investment.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely right for the topic of investment to be so prominent.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) The escalating dispute between Russia and Ukraine has also driven the ruble down to a fresh record low today. A bout of early selling pushed the ruble down by around 1%, so that $1 was now worth 37.6 rubles. The prospect of further economic sanctions being imposed on Russia within days also hit the country\u2019s government bonds, although the Moscow stock market is up 0.8% today. Over the weekend, German chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe would announce new sanctions within the week, unless Russia scaled back its intervention in Ukraine. But rather than pulling back, Vladimir Putin suggested yesterday that discussions on \u201cstatehood\u201d for the south-east regions of Ukraine should begin. That has left the City watching events nervously again, as Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services explains: Developments in the Ukraine will eminently also continue to cast a long shadow, and will obviously be the main topic for discussion at this week\u2019s NATO Summit in the UK, with the weekend call from some US senators to \u201carm the Ukraine\u201d and Putin\u2019s call for an independent state in the Ukraine underlining alarming similarities to the antecedents to World War I. Today\u2019s weak manufacturing data, though, may dampen enthusiasm for new sanctions on Russia, as they are likely to hurt Europe\u2019s economy too. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also fears that Britain\u2019s economy is becoming more unbalanced. He\u2019s worried by the August factory slowdown, and the jump in unsecured lending to consumers in July (see here), saying: \u201cThe combination of today\u2019s data suggests that the UK\u2019s expansion is in danger of losing its balance. In early 2014, investment and exports offered solid support to GDP growth and reduced the economy\u2019s reliance on consumer spending and the housing sector. But there is now concern that the UK is in danger of repeating the problems of the past. We should remember that Britain\u2019s factory sector has been declining as a proportion of the overall economy for decades. This chart, from Bloomberg\u2019s UK economist1 Jamie Murray, shows how overall UK GDP has grown much faster than the manufacturing sector since the mid 1970s. And here\u2019s some full reaction from Jeremy Cook, World First\u2019s chief economist, to the UK factory slowdown: \u201cWhile growth has remained positive, manufacturing is now expanding at the slowest rate since June of last year. \u201cOutput and new orders for UK manufactured goods continued positively, but the slowing of growth has meant that employment change is at its weakest in 14 months. \u201cAll of this points to a rather broad slowdown in British industry, an entirely warranted hangover from the giddy highs that the sector hit in the early part of the year. \u201cConfidence in export markets has slipped in the past month as well, as talk of trade sanctions and a general slowing of global economic momentum has taken its toll. \u201cWhile the worst days of the recession are definitely behind us, this survey also suggests that the finest days of the recovery are too. Gains are going to be a lot more hard-fought.\u201d Here\u2019s a news story on the slowdown in Britain\u2019s factories: UK manufacturing PMI hits 14-month low in August In other British economic news, the number of mortgages being approved has fallen. Just 66,569 new home loans were approved in July, down from 67,085 in June. That suggests the market is cooling somewhat as recent affordability tests hit home. Unsecured lending rose, though, as showing an increase in demand for credit. Mortgages approvals were running at 90,000 per month before the financial crisis struck in 2008, and recently peaked at around 77,000 in January Rob Wood of Berenberg bank lays the blame for Britain\u2019s factory slowdown firmly at the feet of Vladimir Putin. Wood warns that the escalating tensions with Ukraine could hurt UK growth this year, and in 2015. He writes: Putin hits UK manufacturing. The manufacturing PMI fell sharply to a 14 month low of 52.5, down from 55.4 in July and below consensus expectations. Russia\u2019s escalation of the conflict in Ukraine has taken a toll on the internationally exposed manufacturing sector, and that effect could yet worsen further in the coming months given recent confidence drops in the more directly exposed core European economies. These developments pose a serious downside risk to growth this year and next. Wood adds that UK consumers are not (yet) alarmed by geopolitics, with confidence buoyant last month. So far then increased international uncertainty is probably affecting exports and investment plans the most, and could return the UK to the lopsided consumer led recovery seen last year. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says today\u2019s PMI survey shows UK factories haven\u2019t achieved faster export growth: \u201cGrowth in manufacturing continues but at a more controlled level than we have seen so far this year. Although there is still a confident buzz amongst manufacturers, the fragility of a recovery which continues to rely heavily on consumer spending is still an underlying cause for concern. A much-needed boost in export orders is yet to materialise but is becoming increasingly important if the UK manufacturing recovery is to rebalance and become more sustainable.\u201d David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, agrees that this morning\u2019s PMI report shows the UK factory sector is slowing. \u201cUK manufacturers were walking rather than running in August as the sector\u2019s performance fell to a 14-month low and growth began to slow further. There is a distinct easing across the breadth of UK manufacturing, with growth in output, new orders and employment all reducing to a more pedestrian level.\u201d And Noble pins the blame on escalating tensions with Russia, and the weak euro economy: \u201cGrowth in new export orders has slowed to a five- month low against a backdrop of market uncertainty and increasing geo-political tensions. To help plug the hole left by a faltering Eurozone, manufacturers are finding new markets in North America and the Middle East. Vitally however, manufacturers continue to anticipate growth for the foreseeable future, with SMEs in particular, still hiring to catch up with one and a half years of consecutive output and new order growth. Noble also suggests that the new \u2018status quo\u2019 is that Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector will stabilise at \u201ca smaller proportion of GDP than before the recession\u201d. If he\u2019s right, then the service sector would be even more dominant than before, despite talk of rebalancing the UK. Jeremy Cook, economist at World First, fears that the recent revival in Britain\u2019s factory sector may have run its course: There is bad news in the UK too -- Britain\u2019s factory sector has reported a bigger than expected drop in growth last month. Geopolitical tensions, such as the Ukraine crisis, appear to be hitting growth in the sector after a strong performance over the last year. Europe\u2019s economic malaise is also hurting manufacturers. The UK manufacturing PMI fell to 52.5 in August, a sharp fall on last month\u2019s 54.8, and the weakest growth since June 2013. Markit, which compiled the report, says a \u201cbroad slowdown\u201d is underway in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector, with inflow of new business and new export orders weakening and the pace of job creation also easing. Economist Rob Dobson explains: It is also becoming increasingly evident that UK industry is not immune to the impacts of rising geopolitical and global market uncertainty, especially when they affect economic growth and business confidence in our largest trading partner the eurozone. It is noticeable that where export orders were reported to have risen, companies mainly linked this to demand from North America, Asia and the Middle East, as opposed to our European partners. \u201cIt therefore looks as if manufacturing will provide a lesser contribution to the UK economic growth story in the third quarter than at the start of the year. More reaction to follow.... Some early reaction to the news that eurozone factory growth slowed last month: And the upshot of all this morning\u2019s data is that the Eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector has just recorded its weakest growth in 13 months, adding to pressure on policymakers to take more action. The weakness of the euro economy hit Europe\u2019s factories hard last month, with new orders and new export growth slowing. As covered already, France was the main laggard, with its PMI signalling the sharpest rate of decline since May 2013. Italy dropped back into contraction territory, while Spain and Germany both saw slowing growth. Ireland, where the PMI hit a 15-year high, was a rare highlight. The overall eurozone PMI, tracking activity across the single currency region, fell to just 50.7 from 51.8 in July, closer to the 50-point of stagnation. And the number of people employed across the manufacturing sector fell, although it was a mixed picture. The big-three nations of Germany, France and Italy all reported job losses, as did Greece. Staffing rose in Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Ireland, but Ireland was the only nation to report a faster pace of hiring than in July. Rob Dobson of Markit says the report will intensify the pressure on the European Central Bank, which meets this week:\uf0a7 \u201cNational data provided some bright spots, with the Irish numbers still buoyant and signs that Greece managed to move back into expansion territory. France remains a real concern though, with its manufacturing sector contracting at the quickest pace since May 2013, as does Italy\u2019s descent from solid expansion to stagnation. Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring. \u201cThe slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented. Eyes will now turn to the services PMI numbers on Wednesday for further clues on underlying growth momentum and whether policymakers can continue to wait for earlier measures to start to deliver. Reaction to follow... Better news from Greece; factories have reported their first growth since May, with the PMI inching over the 50-point mark. German factory sector has grown at its slowest rate in 11 months, with its manufacturing PMI dipping to 51.4 from 52.4 in July. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike warns that: \u201cWarning lights are flashing in Germany\u2019s goods-producing sector,\u201d The decline in France\u2019s factory sector has accelerated, as Europe\u2019s second largest economy still struggles. The French manufacturing PMI has slipped to just 46.9, well below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. That\u2019s the lowest reading in 13 months. New orders and employment levels both shrank at a faster pace, suggesting the manufacturing sector lost more ground. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe latest disappointing PMI data for France\u2019s manufacturing sector underline its ongoing struggles, with new orders sinking further in a fragile demand environment. Sharply falling output led firms to cut back employment, purchasing and stock levels further in August. This sort of across- the-board weakness has been a common theme in recent months and there remains very little to suggest any turnaround in fortunes will be imminent.\u201d Bad news from Italy. Its factory sector has suffered its first drop in activity in over a year. The Italian manufacturing PMI fell to 49.8 in August, down from 51.9 in July. It\u2019s the first time since June 2013 that the index has fallen below the 50-point mark. Markit, which compiles the report, found that firms cut staff last month as new orders slowed. It\u2019s a worrying signal from the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy, which has already fallen back into recession. As flagged in the intro, Germany\u2019s Federal Statistics Office has confirmed that its economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. That matches the first estimate of GDP, released last month. Today\u2019s report is more detailed, and shows that investment in the construction sector shrank by 4.2%. \u201cGross capital formation\u201d, the wider measure of investment, fell 0.2%. Back to those PMI reports... and the Dutch manufacturing sector has grown at its slowest rate in over a year. The Netherlands manufacturing PMI dipped to 51.7, from 53.3 in July. That still shows that activity expanded, but rather less vigorously. Output, new orders, and employment growth all slowed. Shares in Tesco have fallen by over 1.5% this morning as the City gives new chief executive Dave Lewis a cautious reception. Lewis has been rushed into the supermarket to take charge a month early, after last Friday\u2019s nasty profits warning. Over the weekend, it emerged that one of Tesco\u2019s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, had halved its 3% stake. Harris blamed \u201cunclear management direction and incoherent strategy\u201d, given Tesco will have both a new CEO and chief financial officer (having lured Alan Stewart from Marks &amp; Spencer). Onto Spain, and its factory sector has just recorded its ninth expansion in a row. Growth has slowed, though, with Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI dropping to 52.8 from 53.9 in July. That\u2019s still a fairly decent rate of expansion, given weakness in other parts of the eurozone, although slower than expected. Encouragingly, firms reported that they took on more staff to deal with rising demand. However, some companies also reported that they\u2019d cut prices to secure sales in a number of cases. That suggests client demand remains fragile, says Andrew Harker of Markit. Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted a small rise in activity last month, with its manufacturing PMI unchanged at 51.0. President Putin\u2019s recent policy of \u201cimport substitution\u201d (encouraging firms to use domestic products rather than overseas goods) appears to be stimulating activity. New orders rose at the fastest pace in a year. Here\u2019s the key points: Alexander Morozov, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for Russia, is cautious: The overall impact of import substitution on the Russian economy appears to be negative. Indeed, large scale import substitution typically leads to higher costs and output prices growth, deducting from private consumption more than manufacturers add on the production side. Taiwan has posted the strongest PMI report this morning, with new factory orders rising at the fastest rate in 42 months. But Indonesia\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in a year: Ireland\u2019s factories have just expanded at their fastest rate in 15 years, helped by a big jump in new orders from Britain. The latest purchasing managers survey, which is produced by Investec, found a \u201cmarked improvement in the health of the Irish manufacturing sector\u201d, with output and new orders both accelerating. This pushed the Investec Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which gives a measure of the sector\u2019s health, up to 57.3 in August from 55.4 in the previous month. That \u201csignalled the sharpest monthly improvement in operating conditions since December 1999\u201d. The report suggests that Ireland\u2019s economy is making progress since the country exited its bailout at the end of last year. Demand from the UK helped to push export orders higher, which prompted firms to increase their staffing levels sharply during August. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, Chief Economist at Investec Ireland, predicted that the Irish recovery would continue: This is a strong outcome, particularly when framed against the backdrop of weakening signs from some Eurozone trading partners of late, although the prognosis for Ireland\u2019s other key export markets (the US and UK) remains encouraging. With manufacturing firms in Ireland stepping up their purchasing and hiring activity, it is clear that they are optimistic of a strong finish to the year and, while noting that the risks to global growth and (not unrelated) geopolitical tensions have increased in recent months, we expect to see continued progress into 2015.\u201d There are new fears that China\u2019s factory sector is slowing, after two surveys of the country\u2019s manufacturers came in weaker than expected. HSBC\u2019s monthly China Manufacturing survey has found that output and new order growth slowed last month, as firms continued to shed job. The survey found that: Weaker expansions of both output and new orders recorded Job shedding intensifies Input costs decline for the first time since May That pulled the PMI down to just 50.2, close to stagnation. HSBC economist Hongbin Qu warned domestic demand in China looks subdued, although external demand did improve. Overall, the manufacturing sector still expanded in August, but at a slower pace compared to previous months. We think the economy still faces considerable downside risks to growth in the second half of the year, which warrant further policy easing to ensure a steady growth recovery.\u201d China\u2019s government released its own PMI report this morning, which focuses on larger state-supported factories. And that also showed a slowdown, to 51.1 from 51.7. It also found that factories have now been shedding jobs for the last two years The survey also showed that output, employment, new orders, delivery time and raw material inventory all fell across the board. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world, economy, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re starting the week with a splurge of economic surveys of manufacturing sectors across the globe. The latest Purchasing Managers Indexes from European countries for August will be closely watched, as the eurozone crisis has flared up again in recent weeks. These surveys indicate whether a sector expanded or shrank last month (yes, it\u2019s September...). Any reading of 50 points or more suggests growth, while sub-50 indicates a contraction. Updated German growth data is being released this morning, confirming that its economy suffered a 0.2% drop in GDP in April-June. Analysts are combing through the details now. We\u2019ll be keeping tabs on Greece, ahead of the talks with its lenders which begin in Paris tomorrow. But traders don\u2019t expect much drama in the stock markets today, particularly as it\u2019s the US Labor Day holiday.",

      "bodyText": "It's one of the biggest musical comebacks of all time and no I'm not talking about Kate Bush. High-street music retailer HMV says it is close to wresting the title of UK's biggest music and DVD retailer back from Amazon as Britons rediscover the charm of actually going into a shop and buying a CD or a record. Regaining its high-street crown would be a remarkable achievement for HMV, which went bust just 18 months ago, felled by the toxic combination of declining physical music sales, expensive shop rents and huge debts. The stricken business was rescued by the little-known turnaround firm Hilco, which has also been involved with Habitat and Clinton Cards in the past. Its chairman Paul McGowan says the commonly held view that digital (music) was killing the physical \"was never true\". \"Only 30% [of music buyers] switched to digital \u2013 70% of the market is still physical.\" It's only a \"matter of time\", he adds, before HMV reclaims the top spot from Amazon, which banks 20% of UK music and DVD sales versus HMV's 19%. Sales at HMV stores have increased nearly 14% in the past two months, including a 21% increase in sales of CDs and vinyl records. Key to HMV's resurgence has been an increase in live performances, with more than 300 acts ranging from Ed Sheeran to Megadeth pitching up in stores to plug their latest releases. The retailer says an expanding roster of live acts is a win-win, as Sheeranators, for example, are able to get up close and personal, while at the same time the mini gigs pull in extra punters and sales. They are also good news for record labels too, says HMV, with live performances able to make the difference between a No 5 album and a No 1. With annual sales of close to \u00a3500m, HMV is half the size it used to be, with just 125 stores in the UK. Hilco closed loss-making stores and stopped selling iPads and tablets, instead returning to HMV's traditional stomping ground of band merchandise such as T-shirts. It is now back on the expansion trail with new stores planned in the UK and Ireland, where the chain was initially shut down completely. Hilco's bid to return HMV to its glory days saw the retailer reopen at 363 Oxford Street, the London location of its first store, complete with retro neon \"His Master's Voice\" sign last year. In 1921, music fans made do with the composer Sir Edward Elgar but this time round it was Sir Paul McCartney signing autographs. \"All we are doing is making sure that when you come to our stores you enjoy the experience,\" continues McGowan. \"This is about being an authority in music, not selling music as a commodity.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2014.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has rebutted accusations that a vast free trade deal being negotiated between the EU and the US will act as a cover to privatise the NHS while also watering down food standards and banking regulations. The trade minister Lord Livingston argued that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could add as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy a year. His claims come as the campaign by anti-poverty groups and trade unions against the \"secretive\" nature of the negotiations is getting increasing attention. The deal is being negotiated behind the closed doors at the European commission, between EU bureaucrats and delegates from the US. Campaigners say the talks are being driven by the interests of big transnational companies that want to deregulate markets. But Livingston countered that consumers stood to gain from more choice and cheaper goods, workers would benefit from higher wages as manufacturing makes gains and small companies would be able to break into export markets. The government estimates the average UK household will \"benefit by as much as \u00a3400 a year\". The minister told reporters: \"It's often talked about being a business thing but big benefits are going to come for consumers and small businesses.\" Livingston, who was chief executive of BT until last year, said that during 2015 he hoped to see political agreement on TTIP, the largest bilateral trade deal ever negotiated. The deal will then have to be ratified by individual governments across Europe. He rejected accusations that the process has lacked transparency, highlighting press briefings, consultations and a \"huge amount of discussions\". He added: \"In many ways, it's the most open thing the EU in particular has done.\" The future of the NHS under TTIP has become a key concern among the unions. Critics say the deal threatens to make the outsourcing of health services in Britain irreversible by allowing US multinationals, or any firm with American investors, to sue any future UK government that attempted to take privatised health services back into public ownership, since it would jeopardise their profits. Livingston said the deal, which seeks to cut remaining trade tariffs and simplify regulatory rules, will not change anything for the NHS. \"The NHS and how it chooses to operate will not be impacted by TTIP,\" said Livingston, a Conservative member of the House of Lords. The anti-poverty campaign group War on Want have accused the officials negotiating the deal of trying to remove regulatory barriers that provide important social safeguards and environmental protection. Livingston said European labour laws \"will not be weakened in any way\" by the deal and that there would not be any reversal of banking regulations brought in to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis. \"I have talked a lot to UK financial institutions. None of them are wanting to use this to reduce standards or row back,\" he said. The negotiations were about reducing the varying sets of regulations and looking to a \"single set of rules\" instead, he added. Livingston extended that principle to other areas. \"This is not about reducing standards. This is about creating a single very high standard,\" he said. John Hilary, the executive director at War on Want, reiterated concerns around the TTIP deal opening up public procurement markets to the private sector and he rejected Livingston's claims about the nature of negotiation process so far. \"TTIP is a bill of rights for business, negotiated in secret by the European commission, with all key documents kept confidential, even from our own elected MPs. Any claims of transparency in the negotiations are ludicrous,\" Hilary said.",

He added: \"In many ways, it's the most open thing the EU in particular has done.\"</p> <p>The future of the NHS under TTIP has become a key concern among the unions. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\" title=\"\">Critics say the deal threatens to make the outsourcing of health services in Britain irreversible</a> by allowing US multinationals, or any firm with American investors, to sue any future UK government that attempted to take privatised health services back into public ownership, since it would jeopardise their profits.</p> <p>Livingston said the deal, which seeks to cut remaining trade tariffs and simplify regulatory rules, will not change anything for the NHS. \"The NHS and how it chooses to operate will not be impacted by TTIP,\" said Livingston, a Conservative member of the House of Lords.</p> <p>The anti-poverty campaign group <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/\" title=\"\">War on Want</a> have accused the officials negotiating the deal of <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/trade-justice/ttip\" title=\"\">trying to remove regulatory barriers that provide important social safeguards and environmental protection</a>.</p> <p>Livingston said European labour laws \"will not be weakened in any way\" by the deal and that there would not be any reversal of banking regulations brought in to avoid a repeat of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\"I have talked a lot to UK financial institutions. None of them are wanting to use this to reduce standards or row back,\" he said. The negotiations were about reducing the varying sets of regulations and looking to a \"single set of rules\" instead, he added.</p> <p>Livingston extended that principle to other areas. \"This is not about reducing standards. This is about creating a single very high standard,\" he said.</p> <p>John Hilary, the executive director at War on Want, reiterated concerns around the TTIP deal opening up public procurement markets to the private sector and he rejected Livingston's claims about the nature of negotiation process so far.</p> <p>\"TTIP is a bill of rights for business, negotiated in secret by the European commission, with all key documents kept confidential, even from our own elected MPs. Any claims of transparency in the negotiations are ludicrous,\" Hilary said.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Neil Woodford sells all his HSBC stock due to 'fine inflation'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the UK's best-known investors has sold all his stock in HSBC, warning that \"fine inflation\" means the bank is too risky an investment. Neil Woodford, widely regarded as one of the UK's most successful fund managers, revealed he sold all his fund's HSBC stock last month because he was concerned about the increasing size of fines for past misconduct. His decision is a blow to HSBC \u2013 the UK's largest bank \u2013 which faces a string of multimillion-pound fines from ongoing investigations in at least a dozen jurisdictions, spanning the rigging of benchmark interest rates to the manipulation of gold and silver prices. HSBC warned last month that it faced \"significant\" fines, as it announced a 12% fall in first-half profits to $12.3bn (\u00a37.4bn). Woodford, who launched his own fund in June after 25 years at Invesco Perpetual, said he was concerned that fines are increasingly based on a bank's ability to pay rather than on the transgression. In a post on his blog, he wrote: \"I am worried that the ongoing investigation into the historic manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets could expose HSBC to significant financial penalties. Not only are these potentially serious offences in the eyes of the regulator, but HSBC is very able to pay a substantial fine.\" Woodford sold \u00a364m of HSBC stock in August, which was equivalent to 2.68% of his fund's assets. Although he was not suggesting that HSBC is a bad investment, he said other stocks that are undervalued by markets would better serve his clients. HSBC has seen its reputation battered in recent years. In 2012 it was hit by a $1.9bn fine (then \u00a31.2bn) for flouting US sanctions and failing to stop Mexican drug lords in their money-laundering operations. In August the bank revealed it was setting aside $367m (\u00a3218m) to cover compensation for mistakes in loan statements to UK customers. HSBC paid out nearly \u00a35bn in fines between 2009-2013, according to data compiled by the London School of Economics and Political Science. But it is far from the biggest wrongdoer: the Bank of America has paid out \u00a339bn over the five-year period, followed by JP Morgan, whose fines came close to \u00a327bn. Among UK banks, Lloyds heads the rollcall of wrongdoers, with fines totalling \u00a39bn, followed by HSBC and Barclays. The top 10 banks have paid out close to \u00a3100bn in fines since the depths of the financial crisis, to the end of last year. Roger McCormick, managing director of the CCP Research Foundation, who led the LSE research team, said: \"I am pretty sure that if you asked a bank four years ago if they could expect fines at the level of $10bn or $20bn they would have been very surprised. \"We are still only two thirds of the way through the year and 2014 is producing some remarkable statistics already and when we put the numbers together they are going to be quite significant.\" In July BNP Paribas, France's biggest bank, was fined nearly $9bn (\u00a35.4bn) by US regulators for helping some customers evade US sanctions, despite an intervention from President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who lobbied the White House against \"unfair and disproportionate\" penalties. McCormick said investors needed to judge each bank on a case-by-case basis: \"It is desirable that banks should no longer be able to shrug off regulatory action as just a cost of doing business and something they can afford. In order to overcome that unacceptable attitude it may be important that fines are increased. \"I think some banks are learning the lesson that society has become very tired of this ethics-free, morality-free zone that certainly appeared to be in operation in banks until recent times.\" McCormick is calling for banks to publish quarterly data on regulatory fines, making it easier for investors and the public to compare banks' compliance with the law. \"If you want to restore public trust you have got to make this information available for everyone,\" he said. \"It is high time banks were required to publish data of this kind on a regular basis, so the public at large and not just investors can see what is going on and require banks to give satisfactory explanation about what has happened in the past and what will happen to prevent [misconduct] from being repeated in the future.\"",

The British bank has sold its retail banking, wealth, investment management and corporate banking business in Spain to Caixa Bank for \u20ac800m (\u00a3632m). Caixa Bank, Spain's third-largest lender, will take on 262 branches, 2,400 employees and 550,000 customers once the deal is completed this year. Barclays, however, will keep its investment banking operations and credit card business in Spain. The sale is part of the turnaround strategy of chief executive Antony Jenkins, who wants to restore profitability by selling off some of its struggling European divisions and cutting costs. \"We were clear that this business, while not central to Barclays' strategy, could be attractive to another owner and today's announcement reflects that perspective,\" Jenkins said. \"We remain on track to rebalance Barclays as part of our strategy to deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders.\" Barclays confirmed it had also sold its UAE retail banking business to Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. On this deal, Barclays is making a pre-tax gain of \u00a3119m on the sale of a portfolio of mortgages, unsecured credit and deposits. Barclays will make a loss of \u00a3500m on the Caixa deal; \u00a3400m will be booked in the third quarter of 2014 and \u00a3100m in the final quarter. Barclays expanded rapidly into Spain in the early part of the last decade, buying Banco Zaragozano for \u20ac1.1bn in 2003. The banks operated under a Barclays brand name but ran into problems when the Spanish housing market collapsed, prompting the deep recession. According to Reuters, Barclays shut or sold 161 branches in Spain last year and cut around a third of its workforce in the country. In May, Barclays announced it was cutting 19,000 jobs worldwide, including a dramatic reduction in its investment banking arm, to focus on areas where it had a competitive advantage.",
