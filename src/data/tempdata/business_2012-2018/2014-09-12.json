These costs have been shared across the UK thanks to nationally operated networks, but this cost sharing may no longer be possible for an independent Scotland.</p> <p>Scotland may also wish to take control of the spectrum used to run mobile networks. The 3G spectrum auctioned in 2000 for a 20 year period has six years to run, while the 4G spectrum auction last year has 19 years. The 2G spectrum, used for voice calls, is paid for through an annual licence fee which is currently being renegotiated.</p> <p>EE, the UK\u2019s largest mobile network by customers, is owned by German and French telecoms companies and said it would remain neutral.

Official data from Eurostat showed industrial production rising 1.0% in July, representing the first increase in production since April. The data provide hope that the economy will have picked up in the third quarter, rebounding from the stagnation seen in the second quarter.</p> <p>However, while a rebound in the economy may be on the cards, third quarter growth is likely to be modest at best. Importantly, the monthly data are every volatile, meaning it would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on one month\u2019s improved performance as an indicator of the growth trend.</p> <p>Instead, looking over the past three months, which provides a better guide to the underlying trend, the data show that output was 0.4% lower than in the prior three month period. It could be argued that this includes the weak month of May, when production slumped 1.2% due to the higher than usual number of holidays, meaning the extent of the downturn may be somewhat exaggerated. </p> <p>It is hoped that additional stimulus announced by the ECB in June and earlier this month will help revive the industrial sector in coming months, meaning the underlying trend may start to improve as we move towards the end of the year. However, any further deterioration will boost calls for the ECB to take further action in the form of full-scale quantitative easing, including purchases of government debt.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5412bbc9e4b0ce3d9c4804fb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-12T09:35:24.562Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone industrial output beats expectations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good news from the eurozone! <br></p> <p><strong>Industrial output rose by 1%</strong> in July according to the EU\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat. It was double the 0.5% increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters, and far better than the 0.3% drop in production in June.</p> <p>The annual rate of growth jumped to 2.2% from zero in June.</p> <p>Hopefully this is a sign that the third quarter got off to a decent start in the single currency bloc, where economic recovery has been flagging.</p> <p><strong>Martin van Vliet</strong>, economist at <strong>ING</strong> seems to think so.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The eurozone industrial sector has started the third quarter on a positive note. The increase in the eurozone aggregate was mainly driven by a strong performance in Germany (+1.9%), but was also boosted by a whopping 11.3% rise in production in Ireland, which was largely down to a surge in pharma output. In June, production in Ireland fell by almost 20% on the month, which helps explain the -0.3% eurozone reading seen that month.<br>  Today\u2019s production figures clearly raise hopes that the eurozone economy will return to positive growth in Q3 after Q2\u2019s flat GDP reading. Indeed, if industrial production were to remain at current levels in both August and September, it would rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter in Q3 as whole. <br></p> <p>However, all is not well for the industrial sector. Production remains more than 10% below its pre-crisis peak and the recent weakening in the industrial surveys shows that manufacturers are finding life more challenging, which is not surprising given the tensions and sanctions between Russia and the West over the crisis in Ukraine and the slowdown in demand from some EM economies. It is to be hoped that the weakening of the euro will breathe some fresh life into the manufacturing recovery.<br> <br> <br> </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5412b15be4b0678f1b110bec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-12T09:11:18.264Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a0f121e1-5fd6-418b-a9b5-e5a9b7fcec0f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/12/1410513503703/3564b0f8-65b3-479d-940a-a70f0429a44f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A slowdown in house building is partly behind the slowing growth in construction output\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slowdown in house building is partly behind slowing growth construction output</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty/Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looks like a slowdown in housebuilding is partly behind the drop off from the recent rapid growth in the construction industry.

The annual growth rate was a five-month low but still a solid 15.9%.<br></p> <p>The news of a slowdown in housebuilding follows several reports suggesting <strong>the housing market may be coming off the boil</strong>. <br></p> <p>Yesterday, a closely watched poll of surveyors pointed to a <strong>housing market plateau</strong>, with the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/11/housing-market-plateau-rics\"> number of sales agreed last month falling for the first time in nearly two years</a>. The drop in sales and a fall in new buyer inquiries for the second month in a row could partly be explained by concerns over a rise in interest rates weighing on buyer confidence, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said.</p> <p>But the official construction numbers contrast with the latest business survey for the sector covering August. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/02/skills-shortage-fears-temper-uk-construction-surge-homebuilders\">Builders enjoyed the strongest growth for seven months in August</a> with <strong>home building continuing to lead the construction rebound</strong>, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI survey. That report also flagged concerns among builders, however, around skills shortages and longer lead times for building materials.<br></p> <p>Against the generally upbeat backdrop, the construction industry would likely take the latest official data with \u201cpinch of salt\u201d, said <strong>Stefan Friedhoff, Global Corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking</strong>. He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Other industry readings earlier in the month reported optimism among construction firms.</p> <p>\u201cAs always, the reality is somewhere in between. There is undoubtedly a buoyancy in the industry rarely seen since the recession, but some factors are concerning.

Barclays announced that John McFarlane will replace Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 January. McFarlane will step down as chairman of Aviva and FirstGroup. The chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England governor Mark Carney have cancelled plans to attend a G20 meeting in Australia next week because it clashes with Scotland\u2019s vote on independence. Tim Martin, the boss of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, said Scotland could do well on its own. But the International Monetary Fund has warned investors would be spooked if Scotland votes yes. And BT is expected to enter the debate shortly, in a boost to the no campaign. UK construction output was flat in July, with a slowdown in house building contributing to the weakening performance. There was some good news out of the eurozone, where industrial output jumped 1% in July, double the rate expected by economists. Tottenham Hotspur seemed keen to distance itself from takeover speculation. And there was some upbeat news from the US, with retail sales and consumer confidence both up. Markets in the US and Europe are down, with the exception of the FTSE 100 which is up slightly by 0.1% at 6,806.46. Thank you for reading the blog today and for all your comments. Please join us again next week in the run up to Scotland\u2019s historic vote on independence. AM Data out of the US this afternoon suggests American consumers are doing their bit for the economy. Retail sales rose 0.6% in August, in line with expectations, and consumer sentiment hit a 14-month high in September. The US Commerce Department also revised up retail sales for July, to show growth of 0.3% compared with an earlier estimate of zero growth. Meanwhile the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer confidence index rose to 84.6 in early September - the highest since July 2013 - from 82.5 in August. Breaking... George Osborne is commenting on his decision to ditch the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Australia next week in order to stick around for the vote on Scottish independence (and the potential fallout). It is important I do not go to the G20 meeting due to the economic risks of the Scotland vote . If Scotland separates it will be bad economic news for the whole UK. The statement from Spurs followed earlier confirmation from Cain Hoy that it was considering a bid. Extracts from the company\u2019s statement: Cain Hoy confirms that it is at the preliminary stages of assessing a cash offer for Tottenham Hotspur. Cain Hoy\u2019s considerations are at an early stage, and there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made or at what price any offer might be made. This announcement has been made without the consent of Tottenham Hotspur. A further announcement will be made in due course. Cain Hoy has a takeover panel deadline of 5pm on 10 October announce it will make a bid or walk away. Tottenham Hotspur has commented on the speculation that it is a takeover target for Cain Hoy, a US investment company. Here is the football club\u2019s full statement: Tottenham Hotspur Limited (\u201cTHFC\u201d) notes the continuing press reports surrounding a potential takeover and the announcement released by Cain Hoy Enterprises, LLC (\u201cCain Hoy\u201d). THFC confirms it is not in takeover discussions with Cain Hoy or any other party. As stated in yesterday\u2019s announcement regarding the new stadium project, THFC has been in discussions with multiple providers of finance so that the optimum financing package for the project can be achieved and, in the course of those considerations, has met representatives of Cain Hoy. However, there are no ongoing discussions with Cain Hoy. The Club is focused on the new stadium development and the season ahead. Across the pond, stock markets have opened lower. Dow Jones: -0.13% at 17,026.71 S&amp;P 500: -0.12% at 1,995.10 Nasdaq: -0.07% at 4,588.52 Juliette Garside, the Guardian\u2019s telecoms correspondent, brings this report: BT is expected to join other telecoms firms in issuing a joint warning that an independent Scotland would lead to a major increase in the cost of phone calls and internet access for customers north of the border. The CBI, whose president Sir Mike Rake is also the chairman of BT, has asked the telecoms companies to rally behind the No vote, and a joint statement is expected as early as this afternoon. Connecting Scotland to mobile and broadband networks is expensive, because of the country\u2019s large areas of sparsely populated rural terrain. These costs have been shared across the UK thanks to nationally operated networks, but this cost sharing may no longer be possible for an independent Scotland. Scotland may also wish to take control of the spectrum used to run mobile networks. The 3G spectrum auctioned in 2000 for a 20 year period has six years to run, while the 4G spectrum auction last year has 19 years. The 2G spectrum, used for voice calls, is paid for through an annual licence fee which is currently being renegotiated. EE, the UK\u2019s largest mobile network by customers, is owned by German and French telecoms companies and said it would remain neutral. It is understood that Vodafone, TalkTalk and O2 are considering whether to sign the CBI led statement. A spokesman for EE said: \u201cIndependence is entirely an issue for the Scottish people. Any political changes could of course add complexity to our operations and for this reason we are keeping a close eye on the referendum. We remain fully committed to our network, employees and customers in Scotland.\u201d The chancellor will also miss the G20 meeting. A spokesman for the Bank of England has commented on the decision of governor Mark Carney to skip the G2o meeting in Australia and head back to the UK in time for the results of the Scottish vote. He said: The final decision was taken this week. It is just prudent planning, and you would expect the central bank governor of the United Kingdom to be here for an occasion such as this. Prudent planning a week before a vote we have known about for almost a year and a half... Mark Carney will fly to Australia to chair a plenary meeting of the Financial Stability Board of bank regulators in Cairns on Wednesday, as planned. He will then fly back to the UK earlier than planned, to make it in time for Thursday evening when the results of the Scottish independence referendum will start to roll in. Polling stations will close at 10pm. Carney originally planned to remain in Australia to attend a meeting of G20 finance ministers and governors\u2019 meeting over the weekend of 20-21 September. The governor will be represented by his deputy for financial stability Sir Jon Cunliffe. Breaking: Bank of England governor Mark Carney will miss a G20 central bank governors meeting in Australia next week so that he is the UK when the results of the Scottish referendum come in. The pound has had a volatile week against the dollar, as momentum has swung from the Scottish independence yes campaign to the no campaign, and the latest poll today leaves the vote too close to call. The pound fell after the latest Guardian/ICM poll showed Scotland\u2019s choice between union and independence hangs in the balance. It fell against the dollar to $1.6205 from about $1.6230 beforehand but has since clawed back some of the loss to trade at $1.6220. Breaking: ICM/Guardian poll shows 51% in favour of the union and 49% in favour of independence, excluding undecideds. A sizeable 17% of voters said they had yet to make up their minds, so it\u2019s still down to the wire. The Guardian\u2019s full story is here. For all the latest on the Scottish referendum debate, read our live blog here. My colleague Julia Kollewe has been speaking to Tim Martin, boss of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, who says a pint might be cheaper north of the border if Scotland votes for independence. Julia reports: In contrast to a growing number of retailers who have warned of higher prices in the shops if Scots back independence, Tim Martin, chairman of Wetherspoon, one of Britain\u2019s biggest pub chains, said a pint could actually become cheaper north of the border. He told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd and underestimates the intelligence of the public to say things like the cost of your supermarket goods are going to rise and [independence] is going to result in economic dislocation.\u201d If Scots vote for independence, the new government \u201cmight reduce VAT in pubs to the same level as in supermarkets, and they might do the same for business rates to encourage cafes and pubs. It might bring down the cost of a pint in a pub or restaurant.\u201d He hasn\u2019t spoken to Scotland\u2019s first minister Alex Samond yet, but said: \u201cIf they do get independence, he will be hearing from me within 24 hours.\u201d Wetherspoon plans to open more pubs in Scotland, where it has 75 at the moment (out of 900 across the UK) and employs 4,000 people. \u201cYou could be looking at us with 100 pubs in five years. We might be employing 5,000-60,000 people there in a few years,\u201d Martin said. He added: \u201cThere is no rational reason why Scotland shouldn\u2019t be able to thrive as an independent country if it has a sensible economic policy. There are lots of countries around the world with a similar population to Scotland that have done so. It will depend entirely on the will of the Scots. They have to work hard.\u201d Wetherspoon is the biggest managed pub chain in Scotland, and the second-biggest in the UK, behind Mitchells &amp; Butlers. (A managed pub has to buy some of its beer from a particular brewery or pub company, in contrast to free houses which are independent watering holes.) The price of gold has fallen to 7.5 month lows on rising speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year. Gold is on track for its biggest weekly fall since late May, dropping 2.6%. A rise in interest rates would boost the dollar, which tends to move in the opposite direction to gold. Russia\u2019s central bank has left its central policy rate on hold at 8%, prioritising support for its sanction-hit economy over a need to bring inflation down. The bank said inflation this year was likely to be above 7% because of an \u201caggravation of geopolitical tensions, the imposition of external trade restrictions and the impact of these developments on the rouble exchange rate dynamics.\u201d Russia has effectively abandoned this year\u2019s official inflation target of 5%, as well as a wider range of 3.5-6.5% allowed under the central bank\u2019s rules. The bank said \u201ceconomic activity remains weak\u201d, and described growth as \u201canaemic\u201d. In the second half of 2014 further slowdown in economic growth is expected amid the imposition of sanctions against Russian companies and the remaining uncertainty. It forecast economic growth of 0.4% this year and 0.9-1.1% in 2015. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, isn\u2019t feeling too optimistic about the eurozone just yet, despite the stronger-than-expected industrial production figures. Eurozone industrial production rebounded in July, but the upturn masks an underlying picture of an economy that continues to struggle. Official data from Eurostat showed industrial production rising 1.0% in July, representing the first increase in production since April. The data provide hope that the economy will have picked up in the third quarter, rebounding from the stagnation seen in the second quarter. However, while a rebound in the economy may be on the cards, third quarter growth is likely to be modest at best. Importantly, the monthly data are every volatile, meaning it would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on one month\u2019s improved performance as an indicator of the growth trend. Instead, looking over the past three months, which provides a better guide to the underlying trend, the data show that output was 0.4% lower than in the prior three month period. It could be argued that this includes the weak month of May, when production slumped 1.2% due to the higher than usual number of holidays, meaning the extent of the downturn may be somewhat exaggerated. It is hoped that additional stimulus announced by the ECB in June and earlier this month will help revive the industrial sector in coming months, meaning the underlying trend may start to improve as we move towards the end of the year. However, any further deterioration will boost calls for the ECB to take further action in the form of full-scale quantitative easing, including purchases of government debt. Good news from the eurozone! Industrial output rose by 1% in July according to the EU\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat. It was double the 0.5% increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters, and far better than the 0.3% drop in production in June. The annual rate of growth jumped to 2.2% from zero in June. Hopefully this is a sign that the third quarter got off to a decent start in the single currency bloc, where economic recovery has been flagging. Martin van Vliet, economist at ING seems to think so. The eurozone industrial sector has started the third quarter on a positive note. The increase in the eurozone aggregate was mainly driven by a strong performance in Germany (+1.9%), but was also boosted by a whopping 11.3% rise in production in Ireland, which was largely down to a surge in pharma output. In June, production in Ireland fell by almost 20% on the month, which helps explain the -0.3% eurozone reading seen that month. Today\u2019s production figures clearly raise hopes that the eurozone economy will return to positive growth in Q3 after Q2\u2019s flat GDP reading. Indeed, if industrial production were to remain at current levels in both August and September, it would rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter in Q3 as whole. However, all is not well for the industrial sector. Production remains more than 10% below its pre-crisis peak and the recent weakening in the industrial surveys shows that manufacturers are finding life more challenging, which is not surprising given the tensions and sanctions between Russia and the West over the crisis in Ukraine and the slowdown in demand from some EM economies. It is to be hoped that the weakening of the euro will breathe some fresh life into the manufacturing recovery. It looks like a slowdown in housebuilding is partly behind the drop off from the recent rapid growth in the construction industry. Official figures out this morning show annual expansion for the sector dipping to an eight-month low in July. Construction output was unchanged on the month before after rising 1.2% in June. Annual growth continued as the sector recovers from the its deep downturn, but at 2.6% it was the weakest year-on-year expansion since November. The Office for National Statistics data showed private sector home building rose 1.1% on the month in July, down from 2% growth in June. The annual growth rate was a five-month low but still a solid 15.9%. The news of a slowdown in housebuilding follows several reports suggesting the housing market may be coming off the boil. Yesterday, a closely watched poll of surveyors pointed to a housing market plateau, with the number of sales agreed last month falling for the first time in nearly two years. The drop in sales and a fall in new buyer inquiries for the second month in a row could partly be explained by concerns over a rise in interest rates weighing on buyer confidence, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. But the official construction numbers contrast with the latest business survey for the sector covering August. Builders enjoyed the strongest growth for seven months in August with home building continuing to lead the construction rebound, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI survey. That report also flagged concerns among builders, however, around skills shortages and longer lead times for building materials. Against the generally upbeat backdrop, the construction industry would likely take the latest official data with \u201cpinch of salt\u201d, said Stefan Friedhoff, Global Corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. He added: Other industry readings earlier in the month reported optimism among construction firms. \u201cAs always, the reality is somewhere in between. There is undoubtedly a buoyancy in the industry rarely seen since the recession, but some factors are concerning. Demand is increasing but contractors are having to contend with cost inflation, labour shortages and a relentless pressure on their supply chains. Now to other matters. Construction output was flat in July according to the Office for National Statistics. It followed growth of 1.2% in June, and pushed the annual growth rate down to an eight-month low of 2.6%. Investors have welcomed McFarlane\u2019s appointment as Barclays chairman. The bank is now leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.4% at 228.75p. Barclays has outlined McFarlane\u2019s financial package and other contractual arrangements. In summary, he will be paid \u00a3800,000 a year (\u00a3700,000 cash, \u00a3100,000 in shares), and will receive private health insurance but no pension. Fees and Time Commitment As a non-executive director of Barclays, Mr McFarlane will receive an annual fee of \u00a3250,000, \u00a330,000 of which will be in the form of Barclays shares. As chairman of Barclays, Mr McFarlane will receive an annual fee of \u00a3800,000 (inclusive of the annual fee he will receive as a non-executive director). \u00a3100,000 of the annual fee received as chairman will be in the form of Barclays shares (replacing the \u00a330,000 of the annual fee received as a non-executive director being in the form of Barclays shares). Mr McFarlane\u2019s time commitment to Barclays is expected to be 80% of a full time role. Benefits Mr McFarlane will be eligible for private health insurance. He is not eligible to participate in the Bank\u2019s incentive award and long-term incentive schemes, nor will he participate in the Bank\u2019s pension schemes or receive any pension contributions. Notice Period The appointment letter provides for a notice period of 12 months from Barclays or a notice period of 6 months from Mr McFarlane. The full statement on John McFarlane\u2019s appointment as Barclays chairman is here. Sir John Sunderland, who led the process to appoint a successor to Sir David Walker, had this to say: The Barclays board set very challenging requirements for its new chairman and I am very pleased that in John McFarlane we have identified someone who met all of our criteria. John is an enormously experienced and respected banker with global experience of both retail and investment banking and he will bring great leadership, integrity and knowledge to the role. John McFarlane: I am looking forward enormously to joining the Barclays Board and to working with my fellow non-executive directors, Antony Jenkins and his leadership team to deliver the strategy that Barclays has committed to and which I fully support. Under Sir David\u2019s leadership Barclays has made significant progress in putting in place the foundations for sustainable, long term success. I am very excited to be asked to chair Barclays as it enters the next, important stage of its long history. Outgoing chairman Sir David Walker: I am delighted that Barclays has appointed John McFarlane to succeed me as chairman. We are making good progress toward the delivery of our strategic objectives and I have every confidence that John will work very successfully with Antony Jenkins in leading this great bank through the next phase of that journey. Nils Pratley, the Guardian\u2019s financial editor, gives his instant view on the appointment of John McFarlane as Barclays chairman: This is a solid but unspectacular appointment. McFarlane has long banking experience, and is a proven FTSE 100 chairman. Aviva, after a decade of drift, started to go roughly right when he got the chairman gig. Barclays has announced John McFarlane will join the bank as chairman from 1 January. McFarlane is stepping down as chairman of Aviva and FirstGroup at the end of their respective annual meetings in April and July. Tim Martin, the mullet-haired founder of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, has become the latest business leader to voice his opinion on Scotland. Wetherspoon is well established in Scotland, serving burgers and beer in 75 pubs and employing 4,000 staff north of the border. Asked by the BBC whether he would be concerned by a yes vote, he said: I think Scotland could do very well on its own. New Zealand has a comparable population and does pretty well. Singapore has a very small population and does very well. There is a lot of nonsense talked by businessmen and politicians that it is impossible for Scotland to survive by itself. We think we can trade well there. Maybe if it gets independence we will get some VAT parity between pubs and supermarkets. Martin was announcing annual results for the pub chain, with a 3% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a379.4m. Like-for-like sales - stripping out sales at pubs open for less than a year - increased by 5.5%. Total sales were up 10% at \u00a31.4bn, which the company attributed to menu improvements, longer opening hours, and new pubs. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.16% this morning at 6,810.94. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland - which said yesterday it would move its headquarters from Scotland to England in the event of yes vote - are up 1.27% at 350.5p. It is the FTSE\u2019s third biggest riser this morning. European markets are mixed, but no major moves so far this morning. DAX: -0.02% at 9,689.13 CAC 40: +0.03% at 4,442.37 FTSE MIB: +0.02% at 21,096.63 IBEX 35: +0.15% at 10,902.50 at The FT has removed its online paywall for all coverage of the Scottish independence debate. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. As Scotland\u2019s decision on independence draws closer - now six days away - the International Monetary Fund has become the latest organisation to intervene in the debate. The Washington-based fund has warned of the market uncertainty a yes vote next Thursday would create, given it is not yet clear what the currency and fiscal arrangements would be. William Murray, an IMF spokesman, said there would be a number of \u201cimportant and complicated\u201d issues to be hammered out between London and Edinburgh. The main immediate effect is likely to be uncertainty over the transition to potentially new and different monetary, financial and fiscal frameworks in Scotland. While this uncertainty could lead to negative market reactions in the short term, the longer term will depend on the decisions being made during the transition, and I do not want to speculate on this. The concerns he raises are not new to the debate, but it is significant that the IMF is making such cautionary statements, and will not be welcomed by Scotland\u2019s first minister, Alex Salmond. The warning came as a new YouGov poll showed weakening support for independence. The latest poll for the Times and the Sun revealed 52% in favour of remaining within the UK, and 48% in favour of leaving, excluding don\u2019t knows.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson and the US billionaire he bought Northern Rock from the government with are preparing to float the operation, rebranded as Virgin Money, in a move that could value it at up to \u00a32bn. Shorn of Northern Rock's toxic mortgages, which are still in the hands of the taxpayer, Virgin Money reported a quadrupling in underlying profits from \u00a313m to \u00a360m and gave the clearest indication yet that it intends to float on the stock market by appointing Glen Moreno as its chairman. An increase in the provision for the amount that must be paid to the government in the event the business goes public was also taken as a sign that a float is on the way. When Branson's Virgin Group, Wall Street billionaire Wilbur Ross and an Abu Dhabi investment fund acquired Northern Rock for \u00a3747m in 2011, they agreed to pay the Treasury \u00a350m if they floated the bank on the stockmarket by 2016. In accounts filed on Friday, the bank said it has added another \u00a326m to its provision for a payment to the Treasury, taking it to \u00a340m. \"This provisioning change reflects the view of the company's board of the possibility of an IPO,\" it said. It is also understood that Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have been appointed to handle a sale. Virgin Money declined to comment on a potential float as it announced Moreno \u2013 chairman of publisher Pearson \u2013 will take over as chairman by the middle of next year. Moreno, often cited as a potential candidate to chair a bank, was the acting chairman of UK Financial Investments, set up to manage the government's shareholdings in UK banks \u2013 including Northern Rock \u2013 in 2009. He had already left before a deal was agreed to sell the operation to Branson and Ross. Virgin Group owns 46.5% of Virgin Money, with Ross holding 45% and the Abu Dhabi fund 6%, but it is understood that the two leading shareholders will only reduce their stake on flotation, rather than sell out completely. The bank, which in its Northern Rock days was briefly the biggest mortgage lender in Britain, has returned to volume residential lending. In the first half of the year it advanced \u00a32.5bn in loans, taking its total mortgage book to \u00a320.3bn. But this remains a quarter of the level before the bank imploded, with the controversial book of toxic 125% loans still in the hands of the taxpayer. Savings balances at the bank were flat at \u00a321.1bn, which it said was owing to \"falling rates across the market\". Northern Rock hit trouble largely because of a dependence on wholesale money markets to fund its mortgages, with its savings balances substantially below its loan book. Virgin Money said it is 85% funded by its savings balances, adding: \"All lending is supported by a robust affordability and credit assessment.\" Its chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia, is based in an office Edinburgh but with speculation mounting over the exit of banks from Scotland in the event of a 'yes' vote in next weeks referendum on independence, it played down any impact on the business. Unusually for a trading update, the bank prominently stated that it is \"incorporated in England\" and that its registered office is in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. Gadhia said: \"Looking to the future, we are not burdened by the historical conduct and legacy challenges that face many incumbent banks. We have a powerful brand, a strong balance sheet, a strong core business franchise and through our ambition to make 'everyone better off', a clear set of values that live throughout our business. For all these reasons, we remain confident that we can continue to make real progress on our quest to make banking better and can continue to grow our business strongly, profitably and responsibly.\" Virgin Money employs more than 2,500 staff, with 1,700 people based at Gosforth and another 200 at Norwich. It said it currently has plans to create a further 250 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has turned to John McFarlane to rebuild its relationship with shareholders, appointing the Scottish-born banker as its chairman. McFarlane replaces Sir David Walker, who was parachuted into the bank during the Libor rigging crisis in 2012. The appointment triggered boardroom changes at the other companies McFarlane chaired, including the insurer Aviva. A high-profile figure in Australian banking circles in the runup to the banking crisis, McFarlane was picked by Aviva to shore up its reputation during the 2012 shareholder spring. The insurer has now replaced the 67-year-old with City veteran Sir Adrian Montague. McFarlane will join the board of Barclays as a non-executive director on a \u00a3250,000 annual fee \u2013 becoming the bank's highest paid non-executive \u2013 and step up as chairman after the annual meeting in 2015, when his annual fee will rise to \u00a3800,000, including a \u00a3100,000 allotment of shares in the bank. He joins Barclays following the row about pay earlier in year, when the bank's chief executive, Antony Jenkins, tried to justify a 32% rise in the bonus pool despite a 10% fall in profits by warning of a \"death spiral\" of staff leaving unless they were paid more. Walker, who is now 74, had made clear when he took the chairman role during the height of the Libor rigging crisis that he would stay for no more than three years. \"Under Sir David's leadership Barclays has made significant progress in putting in place the foundations for sustainable, long-term success. I am very excited to be asked to chair Barclays as it enters the next, important stage of its long history,\" said McFarlane. McFarlane, who used to be in a skiffle band and now grow his own olives in Provence, told Reuters last year that there were \"probably less than a dozen individuals globally\" that had the experience to chair banks. \"I do think that a chairman of a bank should ideally have relevant banking experience because of the complexity involved,\" he said. About the same time he told the Evening Standard he was not ready to go. \"I've only been here two years; I've got to see this through \u2026 There is no way on earth I could conceive of chairing a bank. It is just not possible,\" he said. Until he stepped in to stablise Aviva following the ousting of chief executive Andrew Moss during a shareholder revolt in 2012, McFarlane was best known in the City for his tenure on the board of Royal Bank of Scotland. He joined RBS two weeks before its bailout by the taxpayer and the departure of the chief executive Fred Goodwin. When asked about this at an Aviva shareholder meeting, McFarlane said: \"Hopefully I was helpful in the recovery of RBS and I'm certainly not guilty for its demise \u2026 I was slightly instrumental in the change of the chief executive.\" He was at the helm of ANZ \u2013 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group\u2013 for a decade until September 2007. He has also been an executive director of Standard Chartered and was head of Citibank in the UK and Ireland. At Aviva, he was took day-to-day charge of the insurer when he was the incoming chairman to stabilise the business after Moss's removal. The insurer said on Friday that it had been \"made aware some time ago\" that McFarlane could leave and immediately named his replacement as Montague, a serial boardroom director. Montague, who is chairman of 3i Group, non-executive chairman of Anglian Water, non-executive director of two Swedish companies, chairman of charitable trust the Point of Care Foundation and non-executive chairman of Manchester Airports Group, will step up from Aviva's April annual meeting. McFarlane also chaired Scottish-based bus and train operator FirstGroup, which said senior independent director Drummond Hall had begun the process to find his replacement.",
