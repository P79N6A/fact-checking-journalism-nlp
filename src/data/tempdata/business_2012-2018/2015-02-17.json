      "bodyText": "Inflation is the lowest it has been in modern times. The cost of food and fuel is bearing down on the cost of living. Those on the lowest incomes are the biggest beneficiaries as stocking the fridge and heating the home gets cheaper. What\u2019s not to like? Nothing at all, provided the rapid disinflation that the UK is experiencing does not turn into outright deflation. The distinction between the two is important. Disinflation is good news. It increases spending power and living standards by ensuring that prices rise less quickly than wages. Deflation can be very bad news. Where disinflation tends to affect only some sectors of the economy, deflation is a fall in prices across the board. Where disinflation is temporary, deflation is permanent. Consumers and businesses put off spending decisions because they know prices will be lower in the future than they are today. Inflation in the UK as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 0.3% in January, down from 0.5% in December 2014. Further falls are in the pipeline because the latest data does not take into account the sharp falls in crude oil prices in late January, and will only gradually pick up the reductions in energy prices that are gradually being announced. The Bank of England assumes that at some point between the spring and the autumn, the CPI measure of inflation will go negative. That looks a reasonable forecast. There are a number of reasons for thinking that disinflation will not become deflation. Of the 12 individual categories of spending included in the CPI, only three showed annual falls in the year to January. The big factors driving down the cost of living were food, down 2.5% year on year, and transport, down 2.8%. So-called core inflation, which excludes food, alcohol, tobacco and energy, rose last month from 1.3% to 1.4%. In part, that was the result of retailers offering bargains in December that they would normally have held back until January, but there is no immediate sign of a general fall in prices. Oil prices have started to rise in recent weeks and now stand at just over $60 a barrel. Unless the second half of 2015 sees a fall in the cost of crude to match that seen in the second half of 2014, energy will start to add to inflation later this year. There is, though, one big proviso to this benign outlook. That is that the fall in inflation does not lead to lower wage settlements. Were that to happen, deflation would become a real and present danger. Which is why the earnings data needs watching closely over the months to come.",

      "body": "<p>Inflation is the lowest it has been in modern times. The cost of food and fuel is bearing down on the cost of living. Those on the lowest incomes are the biggest beneficiaries as stocking the fridge and heating the home gets cheaper. What\u2019s not to like?<br></p> <p>Nothing at all, provided the rapid disinflation that the UK is experiencing does not turn into outright deflation. The distinction between the two is important. Disinflation is good news. It increases spending power and living standards by ensuring that prices rise less quickly than wages. <br></p> <p>Deflation can be very bad news. Where disinflation tends to affect only some sectors of the economy, deflation is a fall in prices across the board. Where disinflation is temporary, deflation is permanent. Consumers and businesses put off spending decisions because they know prices will be lower in the future than they are today.</p> <p>Inflation in the UK as measured by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/17/uk-inflation-new-low-petrol-price-record\">consumer prices index stood at 0.3% in January</a>, down from 0.5% in December 2014. Further falls are in the pipeline because the latest data does not take into account the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/nov/13/crude-food-inflation-fall\">sharp falls in crude oil prices</a> in late January, and will only gradually pick up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/26/sse-cuts-household-gas-price\">reductions in energy prices</a> that are gradually being announced.</p> <p>The Bank of England assumes that at some point between the spring and the autumn, the CPI measure of inflation will go negative. That looks a reasonable forecast.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for thinking that disinflation will not become deflation. Of the 12 individual categories of spending included in the CPI, only three showed annual falls in the year to January. The big factors driving down the cost of living were food, down 2.5% year on year, and transport, down 2.8%.<br></p> <p>So-called core inflation, which excludes food, alcohol, tobacco and energy, rose last month from 1.3% to 1.4%. In part, that was the result of retailers offering bargains in December that they would normally have held back until January, but there is no immediate sign of a general fall in prices.</p> <p>Oil prices have started to rise in recent weeks and now stand at just over $60 a barrel. Unless the second half of 2015 sees a fall in the cost of crude to match that seen in the second half of 2014, energy will start to add to inflation later this year.</p> <p>There is, though, one big proviso to this benign outlook. That is that the fall in inflation does not lead to lower wage settlements. Were that to happen, deflation would become a real and present danger. Which is why the earnings data needs watching closely over the months to come.</p>",

      "bodyText": "City investors are devising ways to reduce contractual payments to departing company bosses following payouts of more than \u00a32m to two former directors of Tesco. Old Mutual, one major investor, called for directors\u2019 contracts to be \u201csubstantially shorter\u201d than the current norm of 12 months, in light of the payouts to Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee after they left their respective positions of chief executive and finance director of Tesco last year. The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents major investors, said it was time to debate the length of directors\u2019 contracts, which have already been reduced to 12 months from as long as five years in the face of pressure from investors. The Investment Association, whose members control \u00a35tn of assets, said its members were discussing the matter. The debate has been sparked by the recent events at Tesco, which had withheld payments of \u00a31.2m to Clarke and \u00a3970,800 to McIlwee while it investigated last year\u2019s \u00a3263m accounting scandal uncovered by Clarke\u2019s successor Dave Lewis. But earlier this month the supermarket chain announced it would make the payments after being told it had no legal grounds to continue withholding them. Paul Emerton, head of UK stewardship and governance at Old Mutual Global Investors, said 12-month contracts, which carry with them a requirement to hand departing directors a year\u2019s pay, were an anachronism. Emerton said he would be demanding that directors\u2019 contracts should be \u201csubstantially shorter\u201d by March 2016 or be subjected to a protest vote at annual meetings. \u201cThere may be exceptions where salaries and compensatory arrangements are at particularly low levels, but otherwise it will be difficult to support \u2013 and we would therefore generally vote against \u2013 the remuneration arrangements of companies who do not meet our required standard, particularly when we vote at company general meetings,\u201d said Emerton. Directors\u2019 contracts have become shorter in the 20 years since three-year contracts \u2013 and five-year contracts \u2013 were routinely given to directors. Will Pomroy, corporate governance expert at the NAPF, said: \u201cInvestors are rightly interested in how service contracts can be structured to align executives\u2019 interests with shareholders and avoid the need to reward failure. Whilst not straightforward, the standard 12-month notice period for executives is certainly an issue ripe for review in light of recent events\u201d. The Investment Association\u2019s chief executive Daniel Godfrey said it was also worth discussing whether contracts could be made clearer to allow payments to be withheld when investigations were ongoing. The corporate governance code to which investors expect companies to adhere states: \u201cNotice or contract periods should be set at one year or less. If it is necessary to offer longer notice on contract periods to new directors recruited from outside, such periods should reduce to one year or less after the initial period.\u201d But, while the length of directors\u2019 contracts has gone down, the salaries of directors have risen, leading to the potential for larger payments to departing directors. Chris Hodge, director of strategy at the Financial Reporting Council, which polices the City\u2019s corporate governance code, said the subject could be debated more widely and lead to changes in the wording of the code. \u201cIf this does become common market sentiment it is something we would think about when reviewing the code,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, Tesco said it was contractually obliged to make the payments to the former directors \u201cunless it can legally establish a case of gross misconduct\u201d. Mcllwee resigned as chief finance officer in April last year, while Clarke was ousted in July.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece will reportedly apply for an extension to its current loan agreement, distinguishing this from its full bailout programme. Helena Smith reports: Greek state television Nerit is tonight reporting that Athens will apply for an extension to its current bailout \u201cunder certain conditions.\u201d Finance ministry officials are confirming the reports. Greece will apply for an extension of up to six months for its financial assistance program - most likely on Wednesday. The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is believed to have discussed negotiations again, on a one-to-one basis with the EU monetary affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici. The Greek side is making much of the point that prime minister Alexis Tsipras made in parliament earlier: that there is a difference between the the programme of conditions as set out in the previous bailout accord and the loan agreement itself. Pasok, the social democrat party and junior partner in the former coalition government, has slammed the new government saying it is effectively agreeing to a \u201cthird memorandum for Greece\u201d while pretending to put up a robust defence with the country\u2019s partners. Apparently, Greek authorities have pledged to refrain from taking any unilateral action (which would make passage of social reforms on Friday rather difficult). So on that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Investors are clearly hopeful a deal can be reached between Greece and its creditors before the money runs out, to judge by the reaction to Monday\u2019s events on European stock markets, which turned in a mixed performance. The UK in particular is edging closer to its record high, helped by inflation data which suggested there would be no early rise in interest rates. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 41.08 points higher at 6898.13 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.25% to 10,895.62 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.04% at 4753.99 The Athens market ended down 2.45% at 838.61 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 10 points or 0.06%. There may be a certain weariness creeping in: Here\u2019s a link to Tsipras\u2019 full speech to the Greek parliament (in Greek): A Grexit is almost inevitable, in the view of Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart. He writes: There is probably too much coverage of Greece already but most people including the Eurofederalists (notably Juncker, Draghi, Lagarde) still seem to think that another can-kicking exercise can work somehow. However, whatever fine words may or may not be agreed, any deal will would quickly unravel for two reasons. 1. It is not just a matter of principle or politics for the German Government that Greece sticks to the current programme and pays its debts in full, it is also a legal obligation under the Maastricht Treaty, for which it would have to account for any breach to the constitutional court in Karlsruhe. 2. Greece needs a lot more money both for its banks which are suffering massive deposit withdrawals and for itself as many taxpayers are withholding their dues before even the new government takes a stand on its mandate from voters. Grexit seems inevitable and all the parties will suffer. Talking this afternoon to my own contacts in Athens, bemused bewilderment and denial are the prevailing sentiments amongst the lunching classes. And now something from the European Central Bank on the Greek situation, specifically from governing council member Christian Noyer: 17-Feb-2015 16:45 - ECB\u2019S NOYER SAYS SEES SOLUTION FOR GREEK DEBT INVOLVING A RESCHEDULING OR LOWER INTEREST RATES 17-Feb-2015 16:49 - ECB\u2019S NOYER SAYS GREEK ECONOMY MUST BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, CONCERNED REFORMS WILL BE DROPPED More comments from Tsipras: The Greek parliament is due to vote on its contentious reform measures - which it is pressing ahead with in defiance of its bailout agreement - on Friday,. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has given an interview to German magazine Stern, in which he reiterates his usual messages. Anyone suggesting the current programme should be extended by six months is wasting their time, he said, adding: We don\u2019t need [a Plan B] because we will stay in the euro, but we will not achieve this goal at the expense of the weak. And here\u2019s why the Greek banks need the ECB\u2019s support: With withdrawals from Greek banks reportedly picking up, the European Central Bank\u2019s support through its emergency funding programme is key. The ECB is due to review its assistance on Wednesday, but is unlikely to pull the plug while there is a chance of a deal between Greece and its lenders being negotiated (however far apart they may seem), Reuters reports: The ECB\u2019s Governing Council meets on Wednesday and will review the provision of so-called Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greek banks, as Greece is at loggerheads with euro zone governments over the future of its international bailout, which expires at the end of this month. Provision of the ELA funding is essential to the survival of Greece\u2019s banking sector, and hence to the country\u2019s continued membership in the euro zone. The ECB stopped accepting Greek bonds as collateral for funding on February 5, shifting the burden of financing its lenders via ELA to Greece\u2019s central bank. However, the ECB retains control over that ELA funding, which is subject to tight conditions. The rules stipulate that national central banks can only grant such funding temporarily and to solvent banks. \u201cThere is no sudden end of ELA expected this week,\u201d the person familiar with the situation said. The ECB raised the cap on ELA for Greek banks by about \u20ac5bn to \u20ac65bn last week, Greek central bank and government officials told Reuters. The ECB added money because deposit outflows had picked up and to ensure Greek banks have liquidity while tense talks take place in Brussels, Greek banking sources said on Friday. What are the options for Greece and the EU? Economics editor Larry Elliott has looked at the possibilities, and here\u2019s a flavour: Brussels and brinkmanship. It\u2019s a familiar mix. The EU has been there many times before. The latest episode involves the standoff between Greece and the other 18 eurozone members over whether the new Syriza-led government should be forced to stick to the terms of its bailout, despite the Greek people voting for an end to austerity in last month\u2019s general election. The assumption, both in European capitals and the financial markets, is that a deal will be done. That, after all, is what normally happens. An honest broker proposes the outlines of a deal, both sides give a little and a compromise is reached in the early hours of the morning. But there\u2019s always a first time, an occasion when precedent is broken. Europe has 72 hours to find a solution to the Greek crisis. The possible outcomes are limited. The full analysis is here: Greece bailout talks: the options Here\u2019s an updated timetable of events to watch out for in the Greek crisis, courtesy of Deutsche Bank: Tspiras has already spoken, and we now know the identity of the presidential candidate, of course. Time for a recap. Greece is refusing to bow to pressure from its creditors and seek an extension of its bailout programme, without new measures to address its humanitarian crisis and help its economy grow. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras told MPs a few minutes ago that his government will not be rushed into a deal, and will not be forced to compromise. Instead, it will implement the programme it was elected to deliver. \u201cThere has been a custom that newly elected governments act differently from their pre-election promises. I am saying it again, we are thinking of actually implementing our promises for a change.\u201d Germany is also holding its line, at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels today. Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble told reporters that Greece must make the next move, saying: We are not much further than we were. And as we know the situation in Greece is not getting any better.\u201d \u201cGreece must decide does it want this programme or does it not. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, was more optimistic - saying that a solution to the crisis could be found. UK chancellor George Osborne urged both sides to reach an agreement. Otherwise, he warned, economic and financial stability could be badly hit. Osborne said: We are reaching crunch time for Greece and the eurozone, and I\u2019m here to urge all sides to reach an agreement, because the consequence of not having an agreement would be very severe for economic and financial stability..... What Britain really needs to see is competence not chaos. Today\u2019s meetings were overshadowed by the drama at last night\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Talks collapsed after Greece was initially shown a draft arrangement it supported, only to be presented with another, unacceptable version. Financial markets remain calm today, though. And several commentators believe a deal will still be reached. Wolf Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, reckons that Greece has a 60% chance of getting a deal before its bailout extension expires. However, he adds: There is also a chance that Athens decides to drag talks beyond the deadline as the mixture of strong public support at home and the government\u2019s own inexperience could lead Athens to play hardball. In terms of alternative scenarios, there is a 25% chance that Greece decides to let the current program end on 28 February to then apply for a new program (this may require capital controls in the interim to prevent a large deposit flow from Greek banks). Finally, there is a 15% probability that Athens decides to escalate the matter by calling a referendum, not on euro membership but on whether or not to apply for a new program.  ...... The Greek government\u2019s candidate for the presidency is.... Prokopis Pavlopoulos! He\u2019s a former centre-right minister for the interior in one of New Democracy\u2019s governments (the party which Tsipras defeated last month). MPs, who will vote on the presidency tomorrow night, applauded the choice. Although not everyone is overwhelmed: Alexis Tsipras is now explaining what went wrong at last night\u2019s eurogroup . He says that Greece was prepared to sign the proposal drawn up by commissioner Pierre Moscovici, only for it to be replaced at the last minute by Jeroen Dijsselbloem (as finance minister Varoufakis explained last night). Tsipras has condemned that notorious cartoon of Wolfgang Schauble in Nazi uniform. Alexis Tsipras tells MPs that his government will begin the task of fixing Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis. And he also vows to give workers the right to negotiate their pay collectively, reversing one of the country\u2019s austerity measures. Ouch. Tsipras has just accused Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of losing his cool at last night\u2019s eurogroup meeting, and expressing words that undermined Greece. Alexis Tsipras then insists that Greece is in no hurry, and will not be forced to compromise. Over in Athens, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is announcing his nominee for the presidency....and attacking the mistakes of the past at the same time. Speaking in parliament, Tsipras insisted that Greece can no longer be treated like a colony, or a European pariah . For the first time, our country has its own voice, which is being heard also in the streets of Europe, he declared....adding that Greece will exit the \u2018debt trap\u201d created by its austerity programme. We may not have solved all our problems in the last three weeks, but Greeks no longer feel humiliated....they feel proud and dignified, he says. And Tsipras also takes a jibe at Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble for saying a few days ago that he felt sorry for Greeks. In another press room, Latvia\u2019s finance minister Valdis Dombrovskis has predicted that a deal will be reached in time: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble went on to reiterate that his discussions with Yanis Varoufakis have not been acrimonious and he has again refused to speculate on quite what would happen after February 28 if there is no deal. \u201cI have said it three times, I have nothing to reproach about the personal contact I have had with my Greek colleagues.\u201d On what happens after the bailout deal expires at the end of the month, he said: \u201cIf this programme is not concluded in an orderly manner a difficult situation will ensue...But there is no sense in speculating over what will happen.\u201d The German finance minister also said: \u201cAll this speculating and excitement don\u2019t help anything. Of course, we know that whatever scenario the situtation for Greece is extraordinarily difficult and for Europe too. That is not in question at all. But it won\u2019t be made better by us excitedly running around the place...saying oh God, oh God, oh God... And I would point to the so-called financial markets... and they are completely unaffected, they are completely unaffected.\u201d And there was a light-hearted moment at the end..... Asked a question in English at the end of the press conference, Schaeuble said this was still a German press conference and appeared to add a little dig at George Osborne, the finance minister of a non-euro member, but vocal on Greece nonetheless. \u201cI hope George Osborne will deliver some press conference and he is the most engaged mitglied [member] of the eurogroup.\u201d (hat-tip to Katie Allen for the translations) Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble went on to lay the onus on Athens to get a deal by the deadline. \u201cWhat do they want? What is their plan. I don\u2019t know, and so I am staying calm.... but bear in mind, today is 17 February, the programme requires that if nothing happens by 28 February, the programme is over and things can\u2019t happen without a deal in advance,\u201d. He also reiterating the Germany would have to vote on changes to the bailout programme. The German finance minister says he had heard from his Greek counterpart Varoufakis that the latter was \u201cashamed\u201d of the caricature that had appeared of Sch\u00e4uble as a Nazi in Greece. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is telling reporters that there was little progress at yesterday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, (writes my colleague Katie Allen who is watching the press conference). He also raised questions over what Greece is fighting for and how other ministers will be able to sell it to their respective electorates who face their own problems when it comes to pensions, jobs and other welfare issues. \u201cWe sadly didn\u2019t really make any progress\u201d at the eurogroup meeting, the German finance minister said. \u201cWe are not much further than we were. And as we know the situation in Greece is not getting any better.\u201d \u201cGreece must decide does it want this programme or does it not.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble added that \u201cNo one is forcing anything on anyone\u201d and if Greece don\u2019t want to stick with the programme they do not have to, he said. \u201cDoubts have grown over what Greece actually wants\u201d. Sch\u00e4uble said people must remember that an extension will require votes in some countries, including Germany. He also said the eurozone does not just need to hear from Greece that it wants changes to the programme, but wants \u201cclear, reliable, believable commitments to fulfill the programme.... Whether Greece wants that, Greece must decide.\u201d \u201cSometimes I have the feeling that in Athens they don\u2019t know what they want and how things will work out.\u201d He also said help for Greece had \u201cnot lacked in the past and would not be wanting in the future\u201d but that it can\u2019t be abused. This brief video clip confirms that Greece\u2019s Yanis Varoufakis has left the Ecofin meeting: Ed Conway of Sky News reports that UK chancellor George Osborne has raised the possibility of the Greek bailout negotiations floundering: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, is giving a press conference in Berlin NOW, at the end of the Ecofin meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live here Highlights to follow.... Bookmaker Paddy Power has cut the odds on Greece leaving the eurozone this year again, to 6/4 from 3/1. Worth mentioning just for this quote: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a stare down this frightening since the days of Medusa and if further talks fail the Greeks might be left with no option but to leave the Euro.\u201d So who is playing the monstrous Gorgon, and who is the heroic Perseus? Here\u2019s video footage of Yanis Varoufakis, Jeroen Dijsselbloem and George Osborne arriving at the Ecofin meeting this morning: Yanis Varoufakis said: \u201cThe next step is the responsible step... We will continue to deliberate, in order to enhance the chances and actually achieve a very good outcome for the average European. Not for the average Greek, the average Dutch person, or the average German.\u201d Varoufakis added that he was also excited to be discussing the European investment bank today. It appears that the Ecofin meeting in Brussels is wrapping up. Sky News\u2019s Emily Purser reports that Greece\u2019s finance minister will head home tonight: Helena Smith, our Athens correspondent, says a senior Greek government official has announced that the search for a \u201cmutually beneficial agreement\u201d is still very much on. A lot of what we are seeing is political posturing \u2013 theatre that prime minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to indulge in to placate militants in his far-left Syriza party, says Helena. She writes: Almost a third of Syriza, represented by the Left Platform, are against any sort of compromise on the anti-austerity front. The energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, has taken an increasingly strident stance, rejecting any deal that might see the government rolling back on its pre-election pledges. But an official close to Tsipras said this morning that he thought a mutually beneficial solution was still \u201cabsolutely possible.\u201d And he added: \u201cThe Greek government is not going to accept ultimatums. It is determined to honour its popular mandate and the democratic history of Europe. The memorandum [bailout accords that debt-stricken Athens has signed with its creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF] has prompted a humanitarian crisis and led the economy to complete impasse.\u201d Common sense, said the official, as much as the decision of Greek voters to catapult the anti-Syriza party into power, demanded that the accord be ended immediately. The Greeks, Helena adds, will take this to the brink. \u201cWe are good at haggling, it\u2019s in our DNA,\u201d said a former diplomat now a top level official in the EU. Lafazanis, it should be pointed out, put the kibosh on Tsipras\u2019 selection of the veteran conservative Dimitris Avramopoulos as candidate for president, this week. Tsipras is due to announce his chosen candidate for the presidency later today. Now this looks encouraging. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has said there is a \u201cconsensus\u201d with Greece about some of the issues around its bailout programme. Sapin also suggested that Greece could run a smaller budget surplus than currently mandated in its agreement with its creditors; one of Athen\u2019s key demands. FRANCE\u2019S SAPIN: GREECE COULD KEEP PRIMARY BUDGET SURPLUS AT 1.5%/GDP FOR DURATION OF PROGRAMME EXTENSION, BUT NOT LOWER FRANCE\u2019S SAPIN: SOLUTION TO A DEAL IS MAINLY ABOUT WORDING, THERE IS CONSENSUS WITH GREECE ON ISSUES SUCH AS DEBT, NO HAIRCUT The Greek government is telling reporters in Athens that it will not be forced into an ultimatum by the eurogroup, but still believe a deal will be reached. Capital GR\u2019s Efi Efthimiou is tweeting the details This was my favourite moment of last night\u2019s press conference, when Bloomberg\u2019s Hans Nichols asked Varoufakis if he\u2019ll soon be playing Monopoly with fake money: On a lighter note: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has denied that Europe is divided over Greece. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Moscovici insisted that the compromise plan he had presented to Yanis Varoufakis did not show a clash between Brussels institutions. There is no good cop, bad cop. There needs to be a margin of flexibility, room for politics, but everyone must understand the working process. The Commission contributes to the collective work of the Eurogroup. There is not one paper or another paper. There are contributions to a global agreement.\u201d Moscovici added that Greece must make the next move: \u201cThe only privileged scenario is Greece in the euro zone and for that we have told the Greek government that they must now send a request for the extension of the programme, call it technical if you want ... We are united, we all think a solution is possible, there is no plan B,\u201d he said. (via Reuters) If you dig beneath last night\u2019s dramatic press conferences, and George Osborne\u2019s warnings, how close are we to a deal? As I mentioned at the start, many astute observers reckon the two sides will manage to hammer out an agreement to extend Greece\u2019s funding beyond the end of this month. That\u2019s partly because failure would be so damaging (financial blogger Frances Coppola dubs it TINA, or There Is No Alternative). But the other reason is that the two sides may not be as far apart as it sounds. The turmoil in Brussels last night actually works well for both sides, argues Duncan Weldon of Newsnight, bolstering their credibility with their domestic audiences. And he reckons a deal is close, namely: It would be based around the leaked Moscovici draft from yesterday. Here\u2019s how it would play out \u2014 Greece swallows some pride and asks for an extension. The deal gives Greece 4\u20136 months of financing. Syriza hold back on implementing some of their manifesto and continue to run a hunky primary surplus. In the next few months a wide ranging deal is negotiated. Both sides have compromised. Over on Business Insider, Tomas Hirst argues that we misunderstood the \u201cred lines\u201d which Greece\u2019s finance minister isn\u2019t prepared to cross. They relate to ending the Greek humanitarian crisis, not its bailout commitments. And those commitments \u2013 including budget surplus targets and austerity measures \u2013 would be negotiated once Greece has a bridging arrangement/extension to cover its immediate funding needs. He points out that Yanis Varoufakis would have signed that deal yesterday referring to as a \u201cnew arrangement\u201d, rather than tying Athens to the 2012 deal. The current stumbling block is clear \u2014 Greece does not want to pre-commit to \u201chonour all financial obligations to its creditors\u201d within the current programme. This explains why they rejected yesterday\u2019s final Eurogroup draft out of hand as it explicitly called for Greece to honour \u201cthe agreed framework\u201d. Greece has slumped deeper into deflation, data just released shows. Consumer prices fell by 2.8% in January, down from -2.6% in December, Elstat reported.That\u2019s the 23th consecutive month of falling prices. In January, Clothing and footwear prices fell by 2.9% Housing costs fell by 8.0% Transport costs fell by 6.9% Hello.... Greek bank shares have now turned positive, up by 3% after their early wobble. And the main Athens stock market is now flat, having been down 4.5% in early trading. Negotiations between Greece and the eurozone look like \u201ca train wreck\u201d, says Aengus Collins, lead eurozone analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Yesterday was far from a hard deadline but the way the eurogroup meeting collapsed -- in acrimony and over a basic building block of any ultimate accommodation -- was pretty dismal. At the moment, the two sides are running down their reserves of trust more quickly than they are narrowing the gulf that separates them. The Economist Intelligence Unit remains of the view that a last-minute deal will be agreed, but the risk of Grexit remains high at 40%. Nor are these negotiations the end of the challenges for Greece; implementing any revised bailout programme is going to involve painful reforms that will test the resilience of the country\u2019s politicians and its voters\u201d. Here\u2019s the scene inside today\u2019s meeting of EU finance ministers: German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, bottom right, is talking with Finnish Finance Minister Antti Rinne, left. UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that Britain\u2019s economic stability would be hit if a deal can\u2019t be reached on Greece\u2019s bailout. Speaking on his way into the EU ministers\u2019 meeting this morning, Osborne declared We are reaching crunch time for Greece and the eurozone, and I\u2019m here to urge all sides to reach an agreement, because the consequence of not having an agreement would be very severe for economic and financial stability. Adding: What Britain really needs to see is competence not chaos. And then Osborne headed into the meeting room to see his fellow finance chiefs. Just in: Britain\u2019s headline inflation rate has hit its lowest rate since records began in 1989. The consumer prices index rose by just 0.3% annually in January, down from 0.5% in December, dragged down by weak oil prices. Greece\u2019s government debt is being hammered this morning too. Prices are sliding, driving up the yield (or interest rate) on the bonds. The yield on Greece\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond has jumped from 9.9% to 10.6% this morning. The three-year bond yield soared from 17.7% to 19.7% -- a level that suggests a high chance that Greece will default on the loan. Analysts at Commerzbank reckon there\u2019s a 50:50 chance that this deadlock will result in Greece leaving the eurozone. More here. Today\u2019s 4.5% drop in Greek stock prices sounds severe, but it\u2019s largely in line with recent volatility: The Athens stock market is falling sharply at the start of trading, after the collapse of last night\u2019s talks. Bank shares are down almost 9%, as traders react to the latest deadlock. Other European markets are also in the red; Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are down around 1%: A slightly baffling quote from Cyprus\u2019s finance chief: We just received photos from inside today\u2019s meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels. They show that, despite last night\u2019s clashes, Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Yanis Varoufakis shared a handshake and a conversation before the start of the meeting: Varoufakis also spoke with Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos, before taking his seat: Ed Conway of Sky News reports that Greek fatigue is growing in Brussels: Jeroen Dijsselbloem has arrived at today\u2019s EU finance meeting, and pledged that eurozone minister are \u201cready to work\u201d with Greece. But he also repeated that Greece must request an extension of its bailout first: Reuters has the quotes: \u201cI hope they (Greece) will ask for an extension to the programme, and once they do that we can allow flexibility, they can put in their political priorities.\u201d \u201cOf course we will see whether their programme remains on track. But that is the way forward. It\u2019s really up to the Greeks. We cannot make them or ask them. It really is up to them. We stand ready to work with them, also the next couple of days.\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s finance minister Pierre Gramegna, argues that both sides have to make concessions to break last night\u2019s stalemate. Speaking before today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting of finance ministers, Gramegna said: \u201cWe can\u2019t remain in a blockade so everyone has to move a bit, water-down demands so we can find a compromise.\u201d Gramegna added that there is room to maneuver: \u201cThere are flexibilities in the programme, we have to make use of them. When the Greeks are against the programme and don\u2019t want to work in this framework it will be tough.\u201d Austria\u2019s finance minster has predicted that Greece will not be forced out of the eurozone. Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling told the Deutschlandfunk radio station that he was \u201cruling out\u201d the scenario where Greece goes bankrupt and leaves the euro zone. Schelling added: \u201cA \u2018Grexit\u2019 is in noone\u2019s interests - neither the euro group\u2019s nor Greece\u2019s\u201d. Good morning. The recriminations are flying. The inquest is under way. And the clock is still ticking in Greece\u2019s battle to agree a new deal on its debts. As you probably know, talks collapsed at the eurogroup last night after the Greek government refused to stick to its existing bailout arrangements. Greece bailout talks break down after Athens rejects \u2018unacceptable\u2019 eurozone demands In dramatic scenes, Athens cried foul; finance minister Yanis Varoufakis publicly blamed eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem for wrecking a deal. Varoufakis was prepared, indeed eager he said, to sign up to a new plan presented by commissioner Pierre Moscovici. That would extend Greece\u2019s loan agreement, with some crucial modifications, to create time for a \u201cnew contract for growth\u201d. The Moscovici plan, the FT reports, was created following talks between Greek PM Alexis Tsipras and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. At least two drafts are circulating; this version looks to be the final one: In contrast, the version presented by Dijsselbloem shows few concessions to Greece, and still commits Athens to stick to existing targets. Draft Eurogroup statement rejected by Greece Now, all is not lost. Some analysts reckon that, despite the deadlock, the two sides are inching towards a deal. Varoufakis, showing remarkable assurance, predicted an \u2018honourable deal\u2019 within 48 hours. But he also refused to be bounced into Dijsselbloem\u2019s ultimatum to get a bailout request in quickly so the eurogroup could meet on Friday. The action continues in Brussels this morning, where all the European finance ministers are gathering for a full ECOFIN meeting. So we\u2019ll be watching eagerly for signs of progress. The financial markets are holding their nerve; investors clinging to the idea that a compromise will be cobbled out. But the main European indices are still expected to fall around 0.5% this morning. Stan Shamu of IG says: In terms of the next step now, another meeting could be held as early as Friday if Greece submits a request to extend the current programme. It seems all other options are now off the table for Greece and this will certainly put traders on high alert of an escalation of the situation. A consolation is the fact Greece\u2019s Prime Minister has emphasised that a solution could be found in the next couple of days. Regardless of the differences, optimists will continue to feel a solution will be reached somehow to prevent undoing all the hard work we\u2019ve been seeing from European leaders to resuscitate the economy.... The other main events today are 1) the latest UK inflation report, due at 9.30am. Inflation is expected to have fallen closer to zero, dragged down by the tumbling oil price. UK inflation edging closer to zero, analysts predict 2) Greece\u2019s government is expected to name its candidate to become the country\u2019s new president.",

The inquest is under way.

Some analysts reckon that, despite the deadlock, the two sides are inching towards a deal. Varoufakis, showing remarkable assurance, predicted an \u2018honourable deal\u2019 within 48 hours.

The company said it would increase the annual dividend for shareholders by 38% while launching a 3.9bn kroner share buyback programme. Leighton, who is credited with orchestrating a turnaround at Asda in the late 1990s, is expected to be confirmed as chairman of the Co-op within the next few weeks.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Michele Ferrero took over his family\u2019s confectionery firm on the death of his uncle, Giovanni, in 1957, he wrote a letter to his employees. \u201cI pledge myself to devote all my activities and all my efforts to this company,\u201d it said. \u201cAnd I assure you that I shall only feel satisfied when I have managed, with concrete results, to guarantee you and your children a safe and tranquil future.\u201d Ferrero, who has died aged 89, was an entrepreneur of a kind Italy throws up from time to time, inspired more by the social doctrines of the Roman Catholic church than by any belief in the merits of the free market. Over more than half a century, he turned his family firm into a giant multinational, with a turnover in 2014 of \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a36.2bn), and made himself Italy\u2019s richest individual, with a personal fortune that Bloomberg last year put at $26.7bn (\u00a317.4bn). Yet he never deviated from the benign, paternalistic spirit of that first declaration. And he never felt satisfied: he would work all day on Sunday, or through the night, with his closest associates, experimenting and tasting to find new formulas and products. Over the years, there were many of them, including Kinder bars and eggs, Tic Tac mints and Ferrero Rocher pralines. But at the origin of his company\u2019s success was the thick brown spread that remains at the heart of it \u2013 Nutella, a blend of chocolate, nut paste and other ingredients, the recipe for which is a secret as closely guarded as that of Coca-Cola. Secrecy was a personal Ferrero hallmark, too. He never gave a newspaper interview, refused to accept honorary degrees and, according to a report in the daily Corriere della Sera, scrutinised prospective employees from behind a two-way mirror. Because of an eye affliction, he took to wearing dark glasses that made him seem even more remote during his rare public appearances. Son of Pietro Ferrero and his wife, Piera (nee Cillario), Michele was born at Dogliani, south of Turin, in an area known as the Langhe. It is famous for its wines, truffles \u2013 and hazelnuts, which in the previous century had given rise to a local speciality, gianduia. Pietro, who ran the business with his brother, Giovanni, created a product based on gianduia. In 1964, Michele changed the recipe and relaunched it as Nutella. With its associations of childhood indulgence, Ferrero\u2019s spread has since become the ultimate in branded comfort foods. Appropriately, reassurance is central to the firm\u2019s philosophy. Ferrero is said once to have remarked that he was a socialist, adding: \u201cBut I do the socialism.\u201d He arranged for his employees to be collected from the villages around the company\u2019s headquarters in the town of Alba by buses that returned them to their homes at the end of their shifts. He gave them free medical care and other welfare services, including company outings at which they sang a song in local dialect including a line of thanks to \u201cmonsu Michele\u201d \u2013 Mr Michele. To this day Ferrero\u2019s workers have never gone on strike. In recent years, the firm has paid growing attention to issues of equity and sustainability in the developing countries from which it takes many of its raw materials. Behind all this lay Ferrero\u2019s deep attachment to principles instilled in him by his family and the Somaschi Fathers, whose school at Cherasco he attended as a boy. He visited Lourdes at least once a year, arranged for statues of the Virgin Mary to be erected in every Ferrero factory around the world and, it is claimed, took the inspiration for his Ferrero Rocher pralines from the Rocher de Massabielle, the rock grotto at Lourdes at which Mary is reputed to have made a miraculous appearance in 1858. Ferrero\u2019s faith was all of a piece with the habits of a man who spoke in dialect, never attended a university and harboured a lifelong suspicion of the effects of higher education. Carlo Petrini, the founder of the Slow Food movement, who comes from the nearby town of Bra, said Ferrero \u201cembodied the profound spirit\u201d of his homeland. Yet \u2013 and this is something that rankled with many of his compatriots \u2013 he did not live there. He fled Italy at a time when the Red Brigades were kidnapping the members of rich families such as his, but unlike others he never returned, preferring the fiscal advantages conferred on him by tax residence in Monaco. With his wife, Maria Franca Fissolo, whom he married in 1962, Ferrero had two sons, Pietro and Giovanni, who in 1997 became the firm\u2019s joint chief executives. Pietro died of a heart attack in 2011. Ferrero is survived by Maria and Giovanni. \u2022 Michele Ferrero, confectioner, born 26 April 1925; died 14 February 2015",

      "bodyText": "Wood Group, the energy services firm, will cut jobs this year after becoming the latest company to slash spending following the sharp fall in the price of oil. The Aberdeen-based company said it would save more than $30m (\u00a320m) by reducing and deferring spending in the current financial year, and would cut its number of employees. Chief executive Bob Keiller told City analysts: \u201cWe will be reducing our headcount in areas of overhead spend.\u201d Keiller said the company would also limit employee travel, reduce spending with other companies and cancel staff conferences. Keiller declined to say how many jobs might be cut from Wood Group\u2019s 38,000 workforce but indicated that some would be in the UK. He told analysts that a 45-day consultation period was standard in Britain but that less time was required in North America. \u201cThere is nothing inherently there that would stop us doing it, provided we do it in a measured, responsible way in line with local custom.\u201d Wood Group employs 11,500 workers in the UK, including about 4,200 in the North sea, where analysts say oil fields could be forced to shut down without government help for the industry. On Monday, Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon called for urgent tax changes to encourage investment. Wood Group announced the spending cuts as it unveiled pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items up 2.9% to $424.2m for the year ended 31 December. The company increased its annual dividend by 25% to 27.5 cents a share and said it expected the dividend to rise by at least 10% this year and beyond. The company said its customers were trying to cut costs after the price of Brent crude fell from $115 in June to close to $60 this week. But Wood Group said it was positioned to withstand low oil prices because a big part of its business was advising energy groups how to operate more efficiently. \u201cWe are going into a headwind but we are going in with some momentum,\u201d Keiller said. The share price rose more than 10% in response to the management\u2019s upbeat tone and was up 9% at 686.5p during lunchtime trading in London. BP, one of Wood Group\u2019s customers, and Royal Dutch Shell have both announced big cuts in capital spending for this year. BP has cut hundreds of jobs in Aberdeen and thousands around the world, and has frozen pay for its workers. Wood Group said it would benefit from its recent acquisition of Swaggart, a US construction company for the oil industry, and said it expected a good long-term market for its shale activities. The International Energy Agency said this month that lower oil prices would cause a pause in the US shale boom but that it would remain the biggest source of supply growth for the next five years. Wood Group, founded in 1912 as a ship repair and marine engineering firm, said it had opportunities to expand in the Middle East, Africa and Australasia. Oil industry cuts BP is halving exploration activity and reducing overall spending by 20% after suffering a $1bn loss in the final quarter of the year as a result of low oil prices. Shell is cutting spending by $15bn over three years and has warned the government that North sea operations are at risk without tax cuts. Tullow Oil is slashing operating expenses by $500m over three years and has suspended its dividend after suffering a $2bn annual pre-tax loss. BG Group plans to cut investment spending by almost a third this year after being forced to write down the value of its assets by \u00a36bn.",

      "bodyText": "Rising global demand for energy over the next two decades is at odds with the fight against climate change, the head of BP said on Tuesday, as he outlined the oil giant\u2019s forecasts showing unsustainable increases in carbon emissions. BP\u2019s annual energy outlook predicted that the world economy would double in size in the next 20 years, resulting in demand for energy rising by almost 40%. The company said two-thirds of this demand would be met from fossil fuels \u2013 oil, gas and coal \u2013 and that this would lead to a 25% increase in carbon emissions. BP said slower growth in China and India coupled with greater energy efficiency would mean that demand would rise by 1.5% a year over the next two decades, rather than the 2.5% a year recorded during the past decade. Even so, the company said carbon emissions would be growing by 1% a year \u2013 \u201cwell above\u201d the path recommended by scientists to keep emissions below the ceiling of 450 parts per million that would provide a 50% chance of stabilising global temperatures at 2% above pre-industrial levels. Dudl added that the environmental risks put pressure on politicians to come up with a deal at this year\u2019s climate conference in Paris. \u201cThe projections highlight the scale of the challenge facing policy makers at this year\u2019s UN-led discussions in Paris. No single change or policy is likely to be sufficient on its own. \u201cAnd identifying in advance which changes are likely to be most effective is fraught with difficulty. This underpins the importance of policymakers taking steps that lead to a global price for carbon, which provides the right incentives for everyone to play their part.\u201d BP said the continued increase in emissions would come in spite of less reliance on coal over the coming decades. China has been heavily dependent on coal during its rapid industrialisation since 1990, but demand is expected to grow at 0.8% a year in the period up until 2035, down from 3.8% a year since 2000. Even with the expected rapid growth in the use of renewable forms of energy over the next two decades, they will still only account for 8% of energy demand by 2035, BP said. Fossil fuels will account for 81% of energy, down from 86% at present. \u201cFossil fuels are projected to provide the majority of the world\u2019s energy needs, meeting two-thirds of the increase in energy demand out of 2035,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cHowever, the mix will shift. Renewables and unconventional fossil fuels will take a larger share, along with gas, which is set to be the fastest-growing fossil fuel, as well as the cleanest, meeting as much of the increase in demand as coal and oil combined. \u201cMeanwhile, coal is now expected to be the slowest-growing fuel, as industrialisation in emerging Asian economies slows and environmental policies around the globe tighten.\u201d BP believes the recent fall in oil prices will prove temporary, putting the decline from $115 a barrel to a low of $45 a barrel down to increases in supply caused by the US shale revolution. Recent weeks have seen a partial recovery in the oil price, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude standing at around $62 a barrel last night. The oil company said growth in supply from the new US fields would slow but that global demand would continue to increase, leading to higher prices. The forecasts suggest that the US will be self-sufficient in energy by the 2030s, but that the fracking revolution will not spread to other parts of the world. Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cAfter three years of high and deceptively steady oil prices, the fall of recent months is a stark reminder that the norm in energy markets is one of continuous change. It is important that we look through short-term volatility to identify those longer-term trends in supply and demand that are likely to shape the energy sector over the next 20 years and so help inform the strategic choices facing the industry and policy-makers alike.\u201d BP anticipates a slowdown in US shale oil allowing for Middle East output to start regaining lost ground at the start of the next decade, according to the report. The 12 members of the Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) cartel will expand output by 7 million barrels a day while non-Opec supply will increase by 13 million barrels by 2035. Opec will keep its market share of 40% of total global crude production by 2035, according to the report. \u201cThese reports of the demise of Opec seem to me greatly exaggerated,\u201d Dale said. The group decided in November not to cut its production target in order to keep its market share against a backdrop of rising supplies from non-Opec nations, a move that accelerated the fall in oil prices at the end of 2014. The company produced alternative forecasts for global energy demand based on China and India growing at 4% a year rather than the 5.5% a year expected in the base case. In those circumstances, energy demand would rise by 25% rather than 37% in the next two decades \u2013 with the difference equivalent to the total energy needs of the European Union in 2035. Over the same period, North Sea oil production is expected to decline to around 500,000 barrels per day as fields in the basin deplete. \u201cThe North sea is a very mature oil and gas province and it will inevitably go through a decline. It peaked in 1999 at around 2.9 millions barrels per day and our projections are that it will be half a million barrels in 2035,\u201d Dudley said.",

We forecast a charge of $0.7bn in the fourth quarter, making $2.2bn for full-year 2014 (around 74 basis points). However, if correct, this is hardly fatal, and we even see signs of slight relief with the steady decline in PDRS filings in Korea continuing, down to 408 in December \u2013 the second lowest print in 2014. We..cut our target price from 1250p to 1000p, applying a discount... to reflect our revised assessment of a heightened risk of a capital-raising in 2015. However, to be clear, we do not recommend shorting the stock. The shares are already up 9% since 2 February, and if management stands firm and resists pressure to raise capital, we still think that the stock could re-rate materially. Overall, after an early dip after Monday\u2019s collapse of the talks between Greece and its creditors, the FTSE 100 has now climbed 28.65 points to 6885.70. The revival followed UK inflation figures which showed the lowest level since records began in 1989, reducing the pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, and even prompting talk of another cut. David Madden, market analyst at IG said: Mark Carney recently stated he would cut interest rates from their historic low if necessary, and now that UK inflation is at a record low he may be forced to fulfil his promise. Mr Carney won\u2019t be in any rush to loosen the monetary policy, but the falling cost of living is an artificial wage boost for the British consumer, which at least will help the economy where retail sales are concerned. Elsewhere Wood Group has risen 71.25p or 11% to 701.25p after the oil services business reported a 3.1% increase in full year profits to $424.2m, despite the weak crude price. Weir - which supplies pumping equipment to the oil sector - has benefited, up 16p to \u00a318.74. Mining shares are also supporting the market, with Anglo American up 35.5p at \u00a312.56 and Rio Tinto rising 80p to 3243.5p.",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation reaches record low of 0.3%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation fell to the lowest level on record in January as the sharp drop in global oil prices fed through to petrol pumps and food prices continued to fall amid a supermarket price war. The government\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fell to 0.3% in January from 0.5% in December, the slowest pace since equivalent records began for the consumer prices index in 1989. The Office for National Statistics said the drop in inflation was driven by falling fuel and food prices. The chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the news as a \u201cmilestone for the British economy\u201d that will ease the pressure on household budgets as he sought to rebuff fears that the UK could be headed towards \u201cdamaging deflation\u201d. Economists in the eurozone and the UK have been watching for signs of a deflationary spiral where consumers and businesses put off spending in anticipation of lower prices. They were reassured by the news on Tuesday that core inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices such as food and energy, actually rose in January, edging up to 1.4% from 1.3% in December, partly on the back of smaller clothes discounts compared with a year ago. For now there was little reason to fear the UK was prone to the deflationary threat stalking the eurozone, where consumer and business spending was lacklustre and so less likely to fend off a downward spiral in prices, experts said. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC commented: There is certainly no sign of the systemic deflation that took a grip on Japan in the 1990s and the eurozone more recently. In particular, domestic demand growth remains relatively buoyant in the UK, helped by the windfall gains to consumers from lower petrol and food prices. This has put real wages back on an upward track for the first time since the recession. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the German bank Berenberg, said there were many reasons a deflationary spiral was unlikely in the UK, including solid growth and falling unemployment. He added: With every decline in inflation, the screams about \u2018Japanification\u2019 and deflationary spirals will probably get louder. But those worries are overblown. Developments in the UK just recently have very little, if anything, in common with Japan. The UK has not seen low inflation because domestic wages are falling, or because the authorities have left problems in the banking system to fester. Rather the UK is seeing low inflation primarily because oil prices have tanked and sterling\u2019s rise has made imports cheaper.\u201d Falling food and fuel prices take inflation lower in January The ONS data did reinforce expectations that the UK will experience inflation falling into negative territory, albeit briefly, in coming months. The last time headline inflation was negative in Britain was in March 1960, according to the closest comparable data from the ONS. \u201cWe think that a brief period of deflation is imminent,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics. Whilst only Eon\u2019s cut to gas prices came into effect in January, the other utility companies\u2019 price cuts should feed through between now and April. In addition, although we have probably seen the full impact of lower oil prices on petrol prices, we have almost certainly not seen the full effect trickle down to other goods. Accordingly, we still think that the UK will experience a brief period of deflation around March or April this year. With little sign that low inflation is becoming entrenched, though, the UK\u2019s period of deflation should be of the \u201cgood\u201d sort. The figures follow a warning from the Bank of England last week that Britain is sliding towards its first bout of negative inflation in more than half a century. But the Bank governor, Mark Carney said strong economic growth should stave off the threat of a deflationary spiral. Carney and his fellow policymakers have a government-set target of inflation at 2%. The governor has said that if low inflation persists for longer than expected and the global economy is weaker, the Bank stands ready to cut interest rates further from the current record low of 0.5% and to pump more money into the economy through quantitative easing. But policymakers have repeatedly said they expect the next move in interest rates will be up. Business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce said the latest figures showed the Bank must not hurry into raising rates. Its chief economist, David Kern, said: With inflation set to remain low, these figures further strengthen the case for the MPC to keep interest rates on hold until at least 2016.\u201d With the cost of living a key battleground in the run-up to May\u2019s election, Osborne seized on the impact of lower inflation on families\u2019 finances. He said: Today we see lowest CPI inflation ever \u2013 a milestone for the British economy. It is great news for families whose budgets will stretch even further ... Although the low inflation is, as the Bank of England confirmed last week, driven by lower food and energy prices rather than damaging deflation, we will remain vigilant to all risks, particularly when the global economic situation is so uncertain.\u201d Labour emphasised that many households were still feeling the effects of years of wages falling in real terms as pay rises failed to match or beat inflation. The shadow treasury minister, Cathy Jamieson, said: Inflation is falling around the world because global oil prices have plummeted. But in Britain wages continue to be sluggish and working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this government.\u201d The FTSE 100 closed at its highest level for more than 15 years, as the prospect of a rise in interest rates receded following the inflation data. The leading index finished 41.08 points higher at 6898.13, its highest point since the record close of 6930 on 30 December 1999, the peak of the dotcom boom.",

      "bodyText": "The standoff between Greece and its European creditors on Monday has seen shares fall back, but hopes that a deal can still be reached before the eleventh hour is giving some support. Investors are also taking heart from the European Central Bank finally authorising a quantitative easing programme last month. So the FTSE 100 is currently down just 7.02 points at 6850.03, ahead of UK inflation figures. Royal Mail is the biggest faller, 15.6p lower at 432.4p after Morgan Stanley cut its target price from 350p to 340p with an underweight rating. It warned of lower mail volume and a lack of growth in the parcels business, and said its valuation was not justified given consensus earnings per share forecasts had fallen 15% in the last two months, with the prospect of more to come. It said: We see two headwinds in 2016: 1) the decline in letter mail volume could accelerate on the back of weaker macro growth in 2015 and two fewer working days; and 2) parcels revenue growth is still a challenge thanks to intense competition. We remain concerned about the company\u2019s ability to generate parcels revenue growth to offset the decline in lettermail. Additionally, our initial assumptions on further efficiencies in 2016 now look too generous. Despite efficiency efforts, costs will also be impacted by 1) higher non-cash pension expenses, 2) fewer working days and 3) a rolling off of the cost savings initiative from 2015. We have cut our 2016 and 2017 estimated earnings before interest and tax by 25%, with free cash flow down by 15-20%. InterContinental Hotels is down 64p to \u00a325.24 despite a 10% rise in full year profits to $648m, helped by strong growth in the US market. But the company had been expected to signal another share buyback, funded by the sale of the Le Grand hotel in Paris. Among the mid caps, insurer Brit has jumped 28.2p to 302.4p after Canada\u2019s Fairfax agreed a 305p a share takeover, valuing the business at \u00a31.22bn.

Analysts expect the Office for National Statistics report released on Tuesday at 9.30am GMT to show that inflation dropped to 0.4% in January. This is down from the 0.5% recorded in December and well below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. The Bank warned last week that Britain was sliding towards its first bout of negative inflation in more than half a century after it released its quarterly inflation report. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said: \u201cIt will likely fall further, potentially turn negative in the spring, and be close to zero for the remainder of the year.\u201d The slump in oil prices and falling food prices is likely to push inflation to zero in the second and third quarters of 2015, probably dipping into negative territory for one or two months this spring. But Carney said strong economic growth should stave off the threat of a deflationary spiral: The combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help household finances and boost the growth of real take-home pay this year to its fastest rate in a decade. This will support solid growth in consumer spending. Like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and other forecasters, the Bank has revised upwards its forecasts for growth in 2016 and 2017. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, said he was confident that after two years of solid UK recovery the labour market was pointing to better wage gains around the corner. It is hard to find a labour market indicator that has not brightened.
