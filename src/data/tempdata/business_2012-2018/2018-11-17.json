      "bodyText": "Paul Keating this week entered the economic debate like a thunderclap. Much as Shakespeare noted that \u201cwhen beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes\u201d, when great politicians argue, they deliver comets \u2013 words that light up the debate and smash opposition with a force and momentum only the best can produce. No such comets are produced by the feeble politician. It was perhaps why Malcolm Turnbull continued to disappoint throughout his prime ministership \u2013 a man so gifted with words and advocacy yet who failed to advocate and use words to inspire or explain. Instead, the slogan became his standard play and it was a standard no one really wanted to get behind. But at least it was better than the current prime minister, who has adopted such an over-the-top desperation to appear a true-blue Aussie bloke that you suspect even Chips Rafferty at his peak might have thought: \u201cCripes mate, you might want to tone that down a touch.\u201d Keating has never been one to be criticised for failing to use all oratory gifts. And as Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, noted after watching his appearance on ABC\u2019s 7.30 this week: \u201cI do miss a politician who talks in words and phrases he makes up himself, not in soundbites.\u201d The issue that brought the former prime minister into the fray this week was superannuation \u2013 and specifically a report by the Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley and Brendan Coates that suggested there was no need to raise the superannuation guarantee to 12.5%. The superannuation guarantee is one of Keating\u2019s most favoured policy babies and he has always been quick to attack any suggestions it is not as vital as he regards it to be. And so he let fly, belittling the report as \u201crecommending people retire at \u2013 work until 70, put their house in the assets test where now it isn\u2019t. In other words you eat your house, work to 70, eat your house, and then basically find yourself at a certain point in your life where you just don\u2019t have financial assets.\u201d \u201cEat your house\u201d is such gorgeous way to describe a situation where you borrow against the equity in your house to part-fund your retirement. It cuts to the issue \u2013 having to use the equity in your home to pay to eat. And yet gorgeous rhetoric doesn\u2019t make Keating right. The Grattan Institute report did indeed suggest the retirement age should be raised to 70 \u2013 something I have argued against. But it pointedly suggested there needed to be consideration given to those over 60 whose health has been so impaired that it is difficult to work to be able to access the pension and superannuation earlier \u2013 in other words, not one age fits all. The other issue is that, yes, the family home has been long considered sacred and untouchable with regards to capital gains tax or assets tests for the pension. And yet, while that made sense when the average home was worth two to three years\u2019 annual income, it is now worth about seven years\u2019 income. That is a lot of savings being tied up essentially as a family bequest. The major problem is that fewer of us in retirement will own a house because more of us are renting than in the past. Given a great deal of our retirement policy is predicated on the belief that, by the time they retire, most people will have paid off their mortgage, as that fact changes, so too must our policy. This is why Daley and Coates argue the cost of increasing the superannuation guarantee would be better spend on areas such as rental assistance. And one key way to increase housing supply and improve the ability for people to buy a home is to encourage retirees to sell houses bought to raise a family which now are really too big for their needs. The other issue is that Keating is arguing that superannuation currently is not enough to last because people are living longer. It certainly is true that we are living longer (and is incidentally why those like Daley and Coates argue the retirement age should be lifted) but one of the more interesting findings of the Grattan Institute report is how greatly our spending needs decrease with age. They found that low-income earners in the early stages of retirement believed they missed out on experiences such as not being able to afford a holiday once a year or not being able to afford a special meal once a week due to costs \u2013 at much the same level as low-income workers \u2013 and of course they miss our much more than high-income retirees. But by the time they reach 75, both low and high-income earners have the same level of satisfaction. In effect not only do we spend less the older we get, there is less we want to spend money on. This might change as health outcomes for 75-plus year olds improve, but the reality is the percentage of 80 year olds wanting to go on a holiday around Europe is always going to be lower than that of 70 year olds. Some have argued the logical conclusion of the Grattan Institute report is to do away with compulsory super and put the money into the age pension. I\u2019m not in that camp \u2013 I think the superannuation guarantee policy overall is good \u2013 although I believe the retail sector should be kicked out, and the tax breaks that favour high-income earners should be massively wound back. But at least it is an area of policy that gets not just excellent policy analysis, but also the words of a politician passionate about it and able to communicate in a way that grabs your attention and stimulates your brain. Pity it\u2019s one who left office 22 years ago. \u2022 Greg writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Lorraine Gray credits the move to a four-day working week with her company\u2019s rapid growth. She is operations director at Pursuit Marketing, a telephone and digital marketing firm based in Glasgow, and has seen an astonishing 29.5% improvement in productivity in the two years since employees started having Fridays off, with no reduction in pay or other benefits. It has also resulted, she says, in big increases in employee satisfaction and health. Pursuit now expects projected revenues of \u00a35m in the year to June 2019 to rise to as much as \u00a315m in the following financial year. \u201cThis was all about creating a really motivating workplace culture,\u201d Gray says. Call-centre companies tend to have high staff turnover \u2013 and high recruitment costs \u2013 but of Pursuit\u2019s 130 employees, only two left last year. The company initially faced scepticism from clients, particularly \u201cold-school\u201d companies, but now that the four-day model has proved a success, it is planning to test it outside the UK, with new offices in the US and M\u00e1laga, southern Spain. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing whether this works in other countries,\u201d Gray says. Allowing staff to work less but get the same pay sounds like a fast track to bankruptcy. Yet the counter-intuitive idea of a four-day working week is gaining momentum: shadow chancellor John McDonnell last week threw his support behind an inquiry that could one day make it Labour party policy. Like Gray, a growing number of bosses have already taken the plunge, and say they are reaping the rewards. Ankur Shah, a serial entrepreneur who founded slipper brand Mahabis in 2014, said giving workers a day off every week has had no effect on his plan to increase revenues to \u00a320m within three years. \u201cWhen I started this business,\u201d he said, \u201cwe used [the four-day week] from the outset to allow people to focus on the work they do, not the time they spend.\u201d Shah was one of the pioneers of the perk in the UK. He started giving staff Wednesdays off, with no pay cut, at his previous company, Techlightenment, in 2008. The advertising technology firm grew to more than 100 employees before it was bought by credit ratings agency Experian in 2011. At first, he says, the plan for a four- day week split the office, as some staff worried about a lack of structure. But once it was adopted, the reaction was almost universally positive. It has been so successful that Mahabis is now moving gradually to an \u201canywhere, any time\u201d model, in which staff choose their own work model. McDonnell has asked economist Lord Skidelsky to take a thorough look at the impact on productivity of employers moving to a four-day week. Skidelsky questioned the modern urge to work longer hours (to acquire more stuff) in his 2012 book How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life. A long-time enthusiast for more leisure time, he argues that technology should be seen as an opportunity to free employees from the assembly line or computer screen. Reconnecting with family and community in a society that is suffering increasingly from work-related stress must be a good thing, he says. Kate Bell, head of economics at the Trades Union Congress, points out that at one time a six-day week was the norm. She cites figures from 1868, the year the TUC was founded, when a 62-hour working week was the average, compared with today\u2019s 32-hour average \u2013 when part-time work is included. \u201cWe have these promised productivity benefits, and we wanted to think about ways workers can get a fair share of them,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the weekend was the achievement of the 20th century, the four-day week should be our aim for the 21st century.\u201d In a report on the future of work published earlier this year, the TUC said a four-day week for all was a realistic aim for this century. Ironically for the trade union movement, the number of hours worked by lower-paid employees has been falling over the past 20 years and it is now the better-paid staff who tend to work longer hours. A report in January by the Resolution Foundation found that in 2016 low-skilled men in full-time jobs who earned two-thirds of the average wage worked 42.2 hours a week, down from 44.3 hours in 1997. At the same time men on high pay have seen their hours rise and now work the same hours as these lower-paid counterparts. Businesses that seek to squeeze the maximum effort from their skilled and experienced staff are likely to balk at legal restrictions on hours, much as French employers have sought ways around the 35-hour week on the other side of the Channel. In response to McDonnell and the TUC, the Confederation of British Industry has criticised \u201crigid approaches\u201d and policies that are \u201ca soundbite but not a solution\u201d. It might seem logical to ask how widget makers operating on low margins can afford to maintain pay levels while cutting staff hours. Or, likewise, how firms in highly competitive environments, where there are shortages of skilled workers and workloads are already high, could go down this route. But in fact there are no causal links between the UK\u2019s flat productivity since the 2008 crash and particular changes in employment practices. There is as yet no statistical evidence at a national level of a link between lower hours and higher productivity. Equally, there is no evidence that longer working hours achieve better outcomes \u2013 they just lead to burnout and stress. Aidan Harper is a researcher at the Labour-linked New Economics Foundation who has campaigned for a four-day week. He says the change could have a broad range of beneficial effects, from improving gender equality to protecting mental health. \u201cFrom a purely economic point of view, our current model of working is making workers sick and acting as a drag on the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a human catastrophe, the model of working time in this country.\u201d Some analysts blame this on the \u201cUber-isation\u201d of the workforce and a shift to low-grade transport jobs. There is little Uber drivers can do to improve their productivity: for them, a four-day week would just be a cut in income. Technology has, however, also created thousands of high-paid jobs. But with these it is difficult to measure productivity rates, especially when home life and time spent at work are difficult to separate. Linda Holbeche, an academic specialising in organisational design, says a four-day week is of little help unless a business rethinks its purpose and reviews its practices. \u201cIt would be a shame if a four-day week just frees you up to be an Uber driver. That wouldn\u2019t be much of a victory,\u201d she says. Rosie Warin is chief executive of Kin &amp; Co, a communications consultancy in London which gives all its employees Wednesday afternoons off. She is planning to spread the word with a \u201cWednesday off-ternoon\u201d campaign. She says: \u201c[A four-day week is] a big step for a lot of big organisations. Having Wednesday afternoons off might be more realistic.\u201d Labour\u2019s big ideas The average British worker takes five days to achieve what a German worker can in four. The shadow chancellor has some radical ideas to address this gap: Universal basic income A recent poll found that 40% of British people would welcome experiments with the radical policy in their area. Finland recently tried giving \u20ac560 a month to 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58, with no requirement to seek or accept employment. The scheme, however, is not being extended. Co-operatives John McDonnell\u2019s has created a plan is for Labour councils to favour local co-operatives when choosing service providers. This has short-term costs, but supporting local employers that pay well and involve staff in decisions can bring broader benefits. Preston council has adopted the scheme. Workers on boards Under the party\u2019s plans, companies with more than 250 staff would be legally bound to have worker directors elected by the entire workforce. The proportion of workers could be as high as a third. It goes further than most continental schemes, which involve workers in separate workers\u2019 councils or on worker/employer boards that are subsidiary to the main board. McDonnell is also considering a plan to give workers financial shares in their company, though the complex plan put forward at Labour\u2019s conference this year was widely criticised and is now understood to be under review. Nationalisation McDonnell is being urged to spurn traditional state ownership in favour of models that involve workers, consumers and other stakeholders. He plans to nationalise natural monopolies, such as the water industry and electricity and gas suppliers. The Co-operative party, which counts 38 Labour party MPs as members, wants the shadow finance minister to look at Welsh Water as a role model. The Welsh utility was bought with debt raised by a trust rather than the Cardiff government. It has paid off much of its borrowings, has an array of stakeholders and is highly rated by users.",

Yet the counter-intuitive idea of a four-day working week is gaining momentum: shadow chancellor John McDonnell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\" title=\"\">last week thr</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\" title=\"\">ew his support</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/09/john-mcdonnell-shapes-labour-case-for-four-day-week\" title=\"\"> behind an inquiry that could one day make it Labour party policy</a>.</p> <p>Like Gray, a growing number of bosses have already taken the plunge, and say they are reaping the rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e486d759ac9a489ec8901dca69143aedd11377d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e486d759ac9a489ec8901dca69143aedd11377d/0_99_1576_946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ankur Shah of slippers brand Mahabis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ankur Shah of slippers brand Mahabis.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ankur Shah, a serial entrepreneur who founded slipper brand Mahabis in 2014, said giving workers a day off every week has had no effect on his plan to increase revenues to \u00a320m within three years. \u201cWhen I started this business,\u201d he said, \u201cwe used [the four-day week] from the outset to allow people to focus on the work they do, not the time they spend.\u201d</p> <p>Shah was one of the pioneers of the perk in the UK. He started giving staff Wednesdays off, with no pay cut, at his previous company, Techlightenment, in 2008. The advertising technology firm grew to more than 100 employees before it was bought by credit ratings agency Experian in 2011.</p> <p>At first, he says, the plan for a four- day week split the office, as some staff worried about a lack of structure. But once it was adopted, the reaction was almost universally positive. It has been so successful that Mahabis is now moving gradually to an \u201canywhere, any time\u201d model, in which staff choose their own work model.</p> <p>McDonnell has asked economist Lord Skidelsky to take a thorough look at the impact on productivity of employers moving to a four-day week.</p> <p>Skidelsky questioned the modern urge to work longer hours (to acquire more stuff) in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/how-much-is-enough-skidelsky-review\" title=\"\">2012 book </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/how-much-is-enough-skidelsky-review\" title=\"\">How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life</a></em>. A long-time enthusiast for more leisure time, he argues that technology should be seen as an opportunity to free employees from the assembly line or computer screen. Reconnecting with family and community in a society that is suffering increasingly from work-related stress must be a good thing, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d78bbf7b2b576ae10509ec83101597b1668db4d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d78bbf7b2b576ae10509ec83101597b1668db4d0/0_165_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Employees at Pursuit Marketing in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Employees at Pursuit Marketing in Glasgow, where a four-day week is a big success.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kate Bell, head of economics at the Trades Union Congress, points out that at one time a six-day week was the norm. She cites figures from 1868, the year the TUC was founded, when a 62-hour working week was the average, compared with today\u2019s 32-hour average \u2013 when part-time work is included.</p> <p>\u201cWe have these promised productivity benefits, and we wanted to think about ways workers can get a fair share of them,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the weekend was the achievement of the 20th century, the four-day week should be our aim for the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/FutureofWorkReport1.pdf\" title=\"\">report on the future of work</a> published earlier this year, the TUC said a four-day week for all was a realistic aim for this century. Ironically for the trade union movement, the number of hours worked by lower-paid employees has been falling over the past 20 years and it is now the better-paid staff who tend to work longer hours.</p> <p>A report in January by the Resolution Foundation found that in 2016 low-skilled men in full-time jobs who earned two-thirds of the average wage worked 42.2 hours a week, down from 44.3 hours in 1997. At the same time men on high pay have seen their hours rise and now work the same hours as these lower-paid counterparts.</p> <p>Businesses that seek to squeeze the maximum effort from their skilled and experienced staff are likely to balk at legal restrictions on hours, much as French employers have sought ways around the 35-hour week on the other side of the Channel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-16T16:11:50/embed.html\" data-alt=\"hours worked\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-16T16:11:50/embed.html\">hours worked</a> </figure>  <p>In response to McDonnell and the TUC, the Confederation of British Industry has criticised \u201crigid approaches\u201d and policies that are \u201ca soundbite but not a solution\u201d.</p> <p>It might seem logical to ask how widget makers operating on low margins can afford to maintain pay levels while cutting staff hours. Or, likewise, how firms in highly competitive environments, where there are shortages of skilled workers and workloads are already high, could go down this route.</p> <p>But in fact there are no causal links between the UK\u2019s flat productivity since the 2008 crash and particular changes in employment practices. There is as yet no statistical evidence at a national level of a link between lower hours and higher productivity. Equally, there is no evidence that longer working hours achieve better outcomes \u2013 they just lead to burnout and stress.</p> <p>Aidan Harper is a researcher at the Labour-linked New Economics Foundation who has campaigned for a four-day week. He says the change could have a broad range of beneficial effects, from improving gender equality to protecting mental health.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a purely economic point of view, our current model of working is making workers sick and acting as a drag on the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a human catastrophe, the model of working time in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts blame this on the \u201cUber-isation\u201d of the workforce and a shift to low-grade transport jobs. There is little Uber drivers can do to improve their productivity: for them, a four-day week would just be a cut in income.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a2ae5768752aee7ca8f6816f90feb2e827a618e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a2ae5768752aee7ca8f6816f90feb2e827a618e/156_245_3173_1903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cotton mill in the 19th century.

But with these it is difficult to measure productivity rates, especially when home life and time spent at work are difficult to separate.</p> <p>Linda Holbeche, an academic specialising in organisational design, says a four-day week is of little help unless a business rethinks its purpose and reviews its practices.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a shame if a four-day week just frees you up to be an Uber driver. That wouldn\u2019t be much of a victory,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rosie Warin is chief executive of Kin &amp; Co, a communications consultancy in London which gives all its employees Wednesday afternoons off. She is planning to spread the word with a \u201cWednesday off-ternoon\u201d campaign.</p> <p>She says: \u201c[A four-day week is] a big step for a lot of big organisations. Having Wednesday afternoons off might be more realistic.\u201d</p> <h2>Labour\u2019s big ideas</h2> <p>The average British worker takes five days to achieve what a German worker can in four. The shadow chancellor has some radical ideas to address this gap:</p> <p><strong>Universal basic income</strong><br>A recent poll found that 40% of British people would welcome experiments with the radical policy in their area. Finland recently tried giving \u20ac560 a month to 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58, with no requirement to seek or accept employment. The scheme, however, is not being extended.</p> <p><strong>Co-operatives</strong><br>John McDonnell\u2019s has created a plan is for Labour councils to favour local co-operatives when choosing service providers. This has short-term costs, but supporting local employers that pay well and involve staff in decisions can bring broader benefits. Preston council has adopted the scheme.</p> <p><strong>Workers on boards</strong><br>Under the party\u2019s plans, companies with more than 250 staff would be legally bound to have worker directors elected by the entire workforce. The proportion of workers could be as high as a third. It goes further than most continental schemes, which involve workers in separate workers\u2019 councils or on worker/employer boards that are subsidiary to the main board. McDonnell is also considering a plan to give workers financial shares in their company, though the complex plan put forward at Labour\u2019s conference this year was widely criticised and is now understood to be under review.</p> <p><strong>Nationalisation</strong><br>McDonnell is being urged to spurn traditional state ownership in favour of models that involve workers, consumers and other stakeholders. He plans to nationalise natural monopolies, such as the water industry and electricity and gas suppliers. The Co-operative party, which counts 38 Labour party MPs as members, wants the shadow finance minister to look at Welsh Water as a role model. The Welsh utility was bought with debt raised by a trust rather than the Cardiff government. It has paid off much of its borrowings, has an array of stakeholders and is highly rated by users.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Levi Strauss, the world\u2019s most famous denim brand, opened a new flagship store on Friday in Times Square, New York. The 17,000 sq ft store offers on-site tailoring, a T-shirt printer and a mini-museum of the 165-year old brand. Just a few years ago Levi\u2019s was struggling. Strangled by yoga pants and the rise of \u201cathleisure\u201d, and struggling to compete with cheaper jeans from fast-fashion companies like Uniqlo and H&amp;M, the original blue jeans maker was having an identity crisis. Sales were flat and debts were piling up. But it appears to have hit its stride once more. Levi\u2019s is reportedly considering going public, raising between $600m and $800m in a share sale that would value the company at upwards of $5bn, according to CNBC. The company\u2019s rising fortunes have come from embracing its past while accepting the future. According to market analyst NPD, jeans sales rose 5% in the US last year and finally appear to be bouncing back after years of losses to activewear. Adding stretch materials to denim and offering many more styles has increased sales, especially to women, according to NPD. \u201cJeans have always offered form, fashion, and function \u2013 but now they are offering the comfort today\u2019s consumers want,\u201d said NPD\u2019s Marshal Cohen in a note to clients. Stretchy jeans are a long way from Levi\u2019s past. Levi Strauss was a Bavarian immigrant who moved to California during the gold rush of the 1840s and 50s to set up a dry goods business selling his wares to gold prospectors. One of his customers, Jacob Davis, a tailor from Nevada, had worked out how to make hard-wearing work pants by using rivets at the points of stress to make them last longer. The two patented the idea and the first pair of Levi\u2019s was born. Levi\u2019s went public in 1971 but the company foundered and Levi Strauss\u2019s descendants took it private again. Today, the company is privately held by the Haas family \u2013 descendants of Levi Strauss and one of California\u2019s most philanthropic families. The family is worth $3.7bn, according to Forbes, and owns 43% of the company\u2019s shares. Another 200 people, mainly Haas relatives, control the majority of the remaining shares. While Levi\u2019s is a private company, its bonds are publicly traded and it publishes quarterly reports that show why they are thinking of going public again. The company reported its fourth consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in August with sales rising in the US, Europe and Asia. Last year\u2019s sales were close to $5bn. The renaissance has come under the stewardship of Charles \u201cChip\u201d Bergh, a veteran Procter &amp; Gamble executive who launched the Swiffer cleaning brand and used to look after Gillette. Levi\u2019s was a brand Bergh had grown up with, he told LinkedIn earlier this year. \u201cHere you had this incredible, iconic brand \u2013 and yet a company that had really faltered for more than a decade.\u201d Recent woes haven\u2019t all been about competition from other retailers. Consumers are spending less on apparel overall and more on technology and experiences. Stores like Levi\u2019s new flagship offer consumers an experience as well as a chance to shop. They are also an opportunity for Levi\u2019s to sell its history. \u201cThere is definitely a swing back towards authenticity,\u201d said Bergh. \u201cMillennials and Gen Z would rather have fewer items in their closets that are more versatile have real lasting value,\u201d he said. Bergh said that consumers were beginning to \u201cwise up\u201d to the fact that fast-fashion \u201cis just that. You buy something, it\u2019s cheap, you wear it a few times and you throw it out.\u201d Krista Corrigan, a retail analyst at Edited, said denim \u2013 and Levi\u2019s \u2013 were finally emerging from the reign of Lycra. \u201cSince September, there are 20% more jeans in stock than at this same time last year,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile menswear has remained relatively steady, women\u2019s is a different story \u2013 up 30% over last year.\u201d Levi\u2019s, she noted, was being stocked significantly less at value retailers while growing its business among more fashion-forward retailers. \u201cThe success of the Levi\u2019s brand as a whole can be partly attributed to the re-emergence of 90s nostalgia we\u2019re seeing at the moment. There are clear indications over the years that prove denim isn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barbecued bugs are are going on the shelves of British supermarkets as Sainsbury\u2019s becomes the first big UK grocer to stock edible insects. The retailer will start selling roasted crickets \u2013 described as \u201ccrunchy in texture with a rich smoky flavour\u201d \u2013 in 250 of its stores from Monday, capitalising on the growing prominence of bush tucker in the global warming debate. The damaging environmental impact of global meat production has spurred interest in bugs \u2013 which can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed \u2013 as an alternative, sustainable food source. The packaging for the crunchy crickets, made by London-based Eat Grub, deploys the environmental argument in a bid to win over shoppers who might balk at bugs for lunch. The new product is trumpeted by its manufacturer as \u201cmore sustainable than pork scratchings \u2026 and more exciting than a crisp\u201d. The Eat Grub bugs \u2013 acheta domesticus, or house crickets \u2013 are farmed in Europe and come in packets of about 50, at \u00a31.50 per bag. If shoppers can get over the ick factor, they can consume the crickets as a snack or as a garnish for noodles, soups and salads. The global edible insect market is set to exceed $520m (\u00a3406m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects, and the tiny creatures could also help meet the food needs of the world\u2019s growing population. More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets, while they also feature on a few restaurant menus. The move by Sainsbury\u2019s means this is the first time consumers will be able to buy insects from a supermarket. \u201cInsect snacks should no longer be seen as a gimmick or something for a dare,\u201d said Rachel Eyre, head of future brands at Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that consumers are increasingly keen to explore this new sustainable protein source.\u201d Insects are naturally very low in calories and suitable for gluten- and dairy-free diets, as well as being exceptionally high in protein. Gram for gram, dried crickets contain more protein than beef, chicken and pork \u2013 with 100g containing 68g of protein, compared with only 31g of protein in beef. The food group also tops the list when it comes to sustainability. Bugs emit considerably lower levels of greenhouse gases than most livestock and are more efficient in terms of the resources needed to farm them \u2013 crickets, for example, need 12 times less feed than cattle. \u201cAs the population increases, we urgently need to look at alternative protein sources to make the most of land available for food production,\u201d the food policy manager at WWF UK, Duncan Williamson, said. \u201cInsects are incredibly sustainable and can help to reduce our carbon footprint.\u201d Other retailers are capitalising on the rise of insect food. The online grocer Ocado sells Eat Grub\u2019s protein bars made of cricket powder, while the French supermarket group Carrefour has started selling bug-based products from the Jimini\u2019s range in more than 300 of its branches in Spain. The products include spicy chilli buffalo worms and insect-based energy bars, pasta and granola. The UK department store Selfridges, which also sells some of Jimini\u2019s products, will next February launch a pop-up \u201cBug Bar\u201d selling a range of products including cricket flour while introducing shoppers to new recipes. The specialist food shops Fortnum &amp; Mason and Planet Organic also stock the Jimini\u2019s range. Chefs report some success in encouraging their diners to tuck into creepy-crawlies. Archipelago restaurant in central London has cricket and locusts on its menu, bought in bulk frozen from a supplier on the Isle of Wight. Diners at Heston Blumenthal\u2019s Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant can savour mealworms from the Netherlands in edible soil in a savoury \u201cwoodlands-themed\u201d dish \u2013 part of its \u00a3325 tasting menu. Taste test: bitter with a spicy kick\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m fully behind the idea of eating insects, but this one still feels like a work in progress. For one, the cricket looks too much like a cricket \u2013 I can make out its thorax and abdomen and I\u2019d rather I couldn\u2019t. They taste of whatever they are flavoured with \u2013 bitter with a little spicy kick at the end \u2013 rather than the cricket itself, which is perhaps a mixed blessing. But for me the sticking point is the texture. Crisp on the outside, it quickly yields before popping in your mouth. All that aside, if I didn\u2019t know this was a cricket I could well imagine taking a handful out of a bowl at a party without thinking twice. But since I do, I can\u2019t really get past it.\u201d Morwenna Ferrier \u201cI often have a little protein snack to keep me going in the afternoon \u2013 nuts or seeds or something boring like that \u2013 and crickets felt like they could definitely liven up that arena. They were satisfyingly crispy with an overall nutty flavour. There was also some sweetness and a hefty hit of coriander seed, although I suspect they were flavourings that had been added rather than the cricket itself. Despite the horrified looks of my colleagues, I\u2019d recommend them \u2013 they tasted different without being off-puttingly weird. They did look like animal droppings, however, which is even worse than looking like crickets.\u201d Tim Jonze",
