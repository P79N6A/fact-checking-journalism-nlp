      "bodyText": "Poverty in Australia has declined, welfare reliance has stabilised and long-term poverty is becoming rare \u2013 but overall economic wellbeing is no longer improving, and households wealth has remained static, despite rising property prices, according to Australia\u2019s most respected longitudinal study of economic wellbeing. And there is a rapidly growing wealth divide between generations: median wealth for people 65 and over has risen by 61% since 2001, compared with growth of 3.2% for people aged 25 to 34. This is the picture from the latest statistical report of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, from by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. Collated every year, Hilda is Australia\u2019s only nationally representative household longitudinal study, and has followed the same individuals and households since 2001. Stagnating household incomes and wealth Perhaps best summarising the experience of Australian households since 2001 is the path taken by median income, shown in the figure below. The Hilda data show that in the early years of this century, the median household income (after taxes, and adjusted for both inflation and household size) grew strongly. However, since 2009 growth has stalled, the median income stagnant at approximately $45,000. Hilda data on household wealth, collected every four years since 2002, shows a somewhat similar pattern. Median household wealth grew strongly between 2002 and 2006, but has since grown very little \u2013 despite continued increases in house prices. In some respects, Australia has handled this slowdown quite well. There has been relatively little change in income inequality since 2009, and measures of poverty have actually declined slightly in recent years. For example, the percentage of the population with an income less than half the median income was 10.3% in 2014, down from its 2007 peak of 13%. Decline in welfare reliance Furthermore, while Hilda shows that the large decline in welfare reliance among working-age people between 2004 and 2008 was arrested by the 2008 global financial crisis, welfare reliance has increased only slightly since 2008. Nonetheless, it is clear that overall economic wellbeing is no longer advancing as it was prior to the global financial crisis. Financial pressures have also increased for families using childcare and for those with private health insurance. These markets have experienced substantial real price increases, effects of which have been exacerbated by government policies which in recent years have acted to reduce subsidies. Hilda correspondingly shows that household expenditure on these items has been rising faster than household incomes. Winners and losers There are, moreover, some concerning trends evident in the Hilda wealth data. The proportion of adults who are homeowners has declined from 57% in 2002 to less than 52% in 2014, and on current trend will be below 50% by next year. There is an important intergenerational dimension to this decline: home ownership has declined from 39% to 29% among people aged 25 to 34, from 63% to 52% among people aged 35 to 44, and from 76% to 67% among people aged 45 to 54. There has been almost no decline in home ownership among older age groups. Associated with this, but also strongly connected to changes in superannuation holdings and, to a lesser degree, investment property ownership, has been a growing divide in wealth between the young and old. Between 2002 and 2014, median wealth grew by 39% among people aged 55 to 64 and by 61% among people aged 65 and over. By contrast, median wealth grew by only 3.2% among people aged 25 to 34, 7.4% among people aged 35 to 44 and 10.8% among people aged 45 to 54. Hilda also shows that particular groups in the community have continued to experience high rates of disadvantage over the entire period since 2001. Most notably, people with disability, poor general health or poor mental health have not fared well economically, and poverty rates among children living in lone-parent households have consistently been above 20%. Long-term disadvantage The longitudinal nature of the Hilda data further provides important insights into the prevalence and determinants of persistent or long-term disadvantage. Long-term poverty is in fact relatively rare \u2013 85% of poverty spells last three or fewer years. That said, poverty is considerably more likely to be long-term for people with disability, Indigenous people, immigrants from non-English speaking countries, the elderly, single people, people living in rural areas, and people with low levels of education. Perhaps most surprising are Hilda\u2019s findings on welfare reliance over the longer term. While only about 18% of people aged 18 to 64 receive income support payments in any given year, nearly 45% of people in this age range received income support at some stage in the 14 years to 2014. Indeed, nearly 70% of all working-age people were at some stage in a household that received income support payments. Contact with the welfare system is therefore very high, but is typically only for relatively short periods, suggesting the welfare system in many cases works as a temporary safety net rather than as a long-term income source. In 2014, new questions on \u201cmaterial deprivation\u201d were included in the Hilda survey, to provide more direct information on the groups in the community faring worst economically. Among the findings were that 12% of households did not have $500 in savings for an emergency, 8% did not have home contents insurance because they couldn\u2019t afford it, and 5% could not afford dental treatment when needed. Consistent with findings using more traditional income-poverty measures, rates of deprivation were found to be highest among lone-parent families, Indigenous people and people with severe disabilities. The more direct material deprivation approach does reveal, however, that the elderly have very low rates of deprivation, despite having high rates of income poverty. This suggests that income needs are lower for the elderly, for reasons such as their high rates of (outright) home ownership. Implications for future policy The detailed picture of the economic lives of Australians that is provided by the Hilda survey is necessarily somewhat complicated. It is nonetheless clear that the current trajectories of income and wealth are in general much lower than in the early years of this century. The Hilda survey data suggest that the effects of this slowdown have to date been relatively equitably distributed, notwithstanding some concerns about trends in the wealth distribution. Of course, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in future, particularly in the context of the need to reduce the government deficit. The form that deficit-reduction policies take will be profoundly important to the distribution of economic wellbeing over coming years. \u2022 Roger Wilkins is a Professorial Research Fellow and Deputy Director (Research), Hilda Survey, Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has slashed its forecast for UK growth next year after warning that the decision to leave the EU had damaged the British economy\u2019s short-term prospects and \u201cthrown a spanner in the works\u201d of the global recovery. The IMF, which voiced strong misgivings about a vote for Brexit before the EU referendum, said it expected the UK economy to grow by 1.3% in 2017, 0.9 percentage points lower than an estimate made in its World Economic Outlook (WEO), in April. While the fund is ruling out a full-blown recession, the analysis by one of the leading global economic bodies underlines the financial challenges facing Theresa May\u2019s government during a period when slower growth will lead to lower tax receipts and a bigger budget deficit. On Wednesday in Berlin, the prime minister will hold talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Both are keen to minimise the economic fallout of Brexit. Germany, with its heavy reliance on exports, is seen by the IMF as the most vulnerable eurozone country following Britain\u2019s vote. May is expected to warn that she needs time to consult with the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as industry sectors, before starting formal negotiations with Brussels. Tomorrow she goes to France for a meeting with the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, where she will deliver a similar message about the need to resist triggering article 50 until Britain is fully prepared for talks. May and her ministers are keen to talk up the prospects for the economy, with the upbeat response from the Treasury to the IMF report contrasting with the pessimistic tone that had been adopted under George Osborne in the weeks leading up to the EU referendum. A Treasury spokesman said overtures from Australia about a trade deal and the willingness of Softbank to pay \u00a324bn for the technology firm ARM showed the UK could make a success of Brexit. \u201cThe decision to leave the EU marks a new phase for the British economy, but our message is this: our country remains open for business. We are the same outward-looking, globally minded, big-thinking country we have always been.\u201d The IMF urged policymakers in the UK and rest of the EU to end the uncertainty. \u201cOf primary importance is a smooth and predictable transition to a new set of post-exit trading and financial relationships that as much as possible preserves gains from trade between the UK and the EU.\u201d The IMF said it had cut its forecasts for the global economy due to the likely knock-on effect of the vote on other countries, particularly in Europe. Maury Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said: \u201cThe first half of 2016 revealed some promising signs \u2013 stronger than expected growth in the euro area and Japan, as well as a partial recovery in commodity prices that helped several emerging and developing economies. \u201cAs of 22 June [the day before the referendum], we were therefore prepared to upgrade our 2016-17 global growth projections slightly. But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works.\u201d The IMF predicted global growth of 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017, both of which were 0.1 points lower than forecast in April. Britain is still expected to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 this year \u2013 behind the US, despite having its growth forecast for 2016 trimmed by 0.2 percentage points to 1.7%. The IMF believes that next year the UK will have similar growth rates to Germany \u2013 the eurozone economy most affected by the Brexit-induced slowdown \u2013 and France. Germany\u2019s growth is now estimated at 1.2% in 2017, a fall of 0.4 points. It said: \u201cThe vote in the UK in favour of leaving the EU adds significant uncertainty to an already fragile global recovery. The vote has caused significant political change in the UK, generated uncertainty about the nature of its future economic relations with the EU, and could heighten political risks in the union itself. Continuing uncertainty is likely to weigh on consumption and especially investment.\u201d The WEO update said there was a risk that the impact of the UK\u2019s decision to leave could prove worse than expected. \u201cWith Brexit still very much unfolding, the extent of economic and political uncertainty has risen, and the likelihood of outcomes more negative than the one in the baseline has increased.\u201d The IMF outlined two alternative scenarios to its forecast, one moderately worse, one significantly. However, Obstfeld said the resilience of financial markets since 23 June meant that the fund was putting \u201cless weight\u201d on gloomy forecasts. A forecast from the European commission, however, was less sanguine. In its first post-Brexit assessment, the commission said the UK would, at best, grow by 1.1% in 2017, but there was a risk that the economy could contract by 0.3%. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said of the announcement: \u201cToday\u2019s report from the IMF is another blow for the government and further highlights that they had no plan whatsoever for after a Brexit vote.\u201d Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that if the IMF forecast were right, the UK economy would be \u00a321bn smaller than thought: \u201cA \u00a321bn [cut] in the \u2026 economy alone would reduce the tax take by \u00a3150m a week.\u201d The Adam Smith Institute said the \u201crebooting\u201d of the economy after Brexit should include the scrapping of corporation tax, abolition of subsidies for farmers, and protection of Britain\u2019s fishing waters.",

Britain is still expected to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 this year \u2013 behind the US, despite having its growth forecast for 2016 trimmed by 0.2 percentage points to 1.7%.<br></p> <p>The IMF believes that next year the UK will have similar growth rates to Germany \u2013 the eurozone economy most affected by the Brexit-induced slowdown \u2013 and France. Germany\u2019s growth is now estimated at 1.2% in 2017, a fall of 0.4 points.<br></p> <p>It said: \u201cThe vote in the UK in favour of leaving the EU adds significant uncertainty to an already fragile global recovery. The vote has caused significant political change in the UK, generated uncertainty about the nature of its future economic relations with the EU, and could heighten political risks in the union itself. Continuing uncertainty is likely to weigh on consumption and especially investment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The WEO update said there was a risk that the impact of the UK\u2019s decision to leave could prove worse than expected. \u201cWith Brexit still very much unfolding, the extent of economic and political uncertainty has risen, and the likelihood of outcomes more negative than the one in the baseline has increased.\u201d<br></p> <p>The IMF outlined two alternative scenarios to its forecast, one moderately worse, one significantly. However, Obstfeld said the resilience of financial markets since 23 June meant that the fund was putting \u201cless weight\u201d on gloomy forecasts.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/second-referendum-britain-eu-leaders-listen\">There could still be a second referendum in Britain \u2013 if EU leaders listen | Vernon Bogdanor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A forecast from the European commission, however, was less sanguine.

The FRC, which worked with other bodies, such as the Institute of Business Ethics and the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors, intends to hold a conference on the report in September.

The company has been \u201csignificantly underinvesting\u201d in its broadband network, perhaps to the tune of \u201chundreds of millions of pounds\u201d a year, say MPs on the select committee for culture, media and sport. It may have preferred the thrills of BT Sport over the hard graft of providing the country with slick broadband connections. BT should put its house in order or be broken up, they conclude. If the judgment sounds painful for BT, it\u2019s not quite that. Despite the dramatic tone, in the end the MPs\u2019 report fell squarely behind regulator Ofcom\u2019s view that full separation is an option to be kept in reserve. In the meantime, the MPs want the regulator \u201cto remain resolute\u201d in its negotiations with BT in pursuit of plan A, a beefed-up version of the \u201cfunctional\u201d separation of Openreach that has been in place since 2005. As far as it goes, that\u2019s fine. Ofcom was right not to demand a breakup since the costs and hassle could easily be counter-productive. But the details of the regulatory plan, due to be unveiled next week, are crucial. BT may be told to create an independent board for Openreach with powers to command investment or to pursue co-investment projects. Jolly good, but that new board has to be seen to have real clout. The MPs think they have discovered where investment in broadband has been lost. It\u2019s in the gap between Openreach\u2019s cost of capital of 8.8% and a rate of return of 10.4% demanded by BT on investments. One suspects the tale may be more complicated, but BT ought to be explain the arithmetic to sceptical MPs and others. Nor should BT grumble about the demand for extra transparency. The trade-off for leaving the company intact (for now) should be more visibility of how it spends its money. The pledge to boost investment in broadband is welcome \u2013 but we\u2019d still like to see the calculations. Roll up, roll up What would the government do if Exxon bid for BP tomorrow? The question feels more urgent in light of SoftBank of Japan\u2019s agreed \u00a324.3bn takeover of microchip designer ARM Holdings. The prime minister, Theresa May, is resolved to be more interventionist on foreign bids but hasn\u2019t set out firm principles, beyond saying she would have blocked Pfizer\u2019s tilt at AstraZeneca in 2014. On the evidence of Downing Street\u2019s enthusiastic welcome for SoftBank, Exxon would merely have to promise to sustain investment in the North Sea for five years to receive a thumbs-up. SoftBank\u2019s equivalent pledge to keep investing in ARM in Cambridge brought forth tributes about the UK being open for business. But, come on, Exxon/BP could hardly be like that. The government would face deep questions about how many UK firms it would be prepared to see sold. Five-year promises, untested in the courts, would be denounced as a sideshow. The fuzzy question of national champions \u2013 and their ability to attract investment \u2013 would be debated in parliament. As it happens, on a 20-year view, the UK\u2019s future in technology is probably at least as important as its prospects in fossil fuels. It\u2019s just that SoftBank was always going to win approval. The government wanted to show foreign investment is still flowing after the referendum; and the Japanese crafted their pitch well, volunteering their employment pledges rather than having them extracted. But the next test of May\u2019s new thinking may be trickier. Pfizer, viewed as a tax-minimising slasher of research budgets, would have failed. But who else would? Or, since bids will always be examined on a case-by-case basis, what is the process for making judgments and enforcing them? Will the government legislate for a power of veto? Whatever the answer, it has to be more substantial than the bidder getting an audience with the chancellor on a sunny Sunday afternoon to sell its wares. Fix this, Mr Fix-It As Andrew Bailey, the new Mr Fix-It at the Financial Conduct Authority, mulls his mission statement, here\u2019s a suggestion: refrain from lofty moralising and just promise to get your reports completed more quickly. The official report into the failure of HBOS took an age. Now, we learn, we will have to wait a little longer for the FCA\u2019s verdict on how Royal Bank of Scotland treated its small business customers. Lawrence Tomlinson, entrepreneur and former adviser to Sir Vince Cable when business secretary, published his highly charged report in November 2013 and the FCA started its own investigation soon afterwards.

About 55% of the group\u2019s customers are British. Consumers lambasted the company on social media. Last Thursday, the day before its collapse, Lowcostholidays had caused a flurry of late bookings by extending a summer sale promising up to 60% off holiday prices.

What were administrators doing to allow money to be taken after the event?\u201d Ray James, 62, a mailroom assistant from Sidcup, south-east London, had booked a 10-day holiday to Benalm\u00e1dena on the Costa del Sol through the operator for himself and his wife, four other adults and five children, flying out in August. \u201cWe are over \u00a33,000 out of pocket and we did not find out until Monday night about the company\u2019s collapse \u2013 we heard nothing from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our first big family holiday for two years and we have saved hard for it. We are distraught.\u201d Many were angry at receiving a request for feedback about customer satisfaction, following their booking and payment, after the company collapsed. Another customer wrote: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I would be sent a feedback request considering I paid the balance of my holiday and within a couple of hours the company declared it went under! When I sent my payment it should NOT have been accepted and a message sent that the company was closing. Shameful and pitiful.\u201d In 2013, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) highlighted the lack of protection afforded to UK consumers when the company\u2019s millionaire owner, Paul Evans, relocated Lowcostholidays to Spain, pulling the group out of the travel association Abta and the Atol protection scheme. Evans sought legal advice that allowed him to start selling from Mallorca, in line with an EU directive to enable services to be sold across borders. EasyJet, which had engaged Lowcostholidays to supply hotels for the airline\u2019s holiday arm, ended the contract in March 2015, partly because of concerns over consumer protection following the decision to relocate the business. On Tuesday, administrators Smith &amp; Williamson confirmed that a bond in place for \u20ac1.3m (\u00a31.09m) was enough to pay out only a few pounds to each customer. Expecting \u201cvery substantial\u201d claims from about 140,000 aggrieved holidaymakers, the administrators warned that pooled compensation was unlikely to be more than 1%-2% per claimant \u2013 potentially less than \u00a310. Noel Josephides, the chairman of Abta, said: \u201cEvans exploited a loophole that everybody knew existed \u2013 he had the best legal advice and he made the step.\u201d Most Spanish tourism is domestic and the bond is far below what an equivalent British company would expect to pay for the volume of travellers. UK operators and agents also pay \u00a32.50 per traveller to the CAA for an air travel trust fund to cover possible business collapse, a levy not imposed in Spain, and are liable to pay VAT on top. Josephides said the bond showed up \u201cthe chinks in the armour of the EU legislation: the way that Spain and the Balearics implemented it was very different, but I don\u2019t suppose they ever thought they would have a big outbound operator like Paul Evans on their hands, or really understand the sort of hit they would get\u201d. The UK European Consumer Centre (UK ECC) advised those already on holiday to keep all receipts for any expenses related to Lowcostholidays ceasing trading, saying that it might be possible to make a claim via debit or credit card, or an insurer. It said those who have not yet received flight tickets should check with the airline to ensure that they have a booking, and contact their hotel, but that they would probably find that the reservation had not been paid for. The UK ECC urged those hoping to get their money back via the Visa Chargeback scheme, where they have paid by debit card, to contact their bank and request a chargeback for the amount paid. Those who paid with a credit card may be able to get a refund from their provider. Under section 75 of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act, credit card companies are jointly liable with retailers if something goes wrong, such as a company going into administration. The UK ECC spokeswoman Jane Negus said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that there is an organisation such as the Spanish regulator for travel agencies. However, consumers are not likely to receive all of their money back via this avenue, as there are limited funds available. \u201cConsumers will also need to pursue other options as well. However, if they are in any doubt, they should contact the UK European Consumer Centre on 01268 886 690 for advice.\u201d Who is Paul Evans? Paul Evans, the Lowcostholidays founder who turns 57 this month, may have run a multimillion-pound company appealing to the most cost-conscious British holidaymakers, but he was no stranger to wealth, having attended Eton and sent his sons to Britain\u2019s top public schools. Part Brazilian on his mother\u2019s side, Evans\u2019 career in travel started in the unlikely environment for an Old Etonian of Club 18-30, from where he worked his way up in the mainstream industry through companies such as Airtours and MyTravel, to eventually become managing director of First Choice. As the internet took off, Evans was involved in ventures selling rooms online before founding Lowcosttravel group in 2004. A well-known figure on industry platforms, he also featured as the \u201ctravel guy\u201d on Steve Wright\u2019s BBC Radio 2 show, although his profile faded in the UK after he relocated his company to Mallorca to cut costs, following public disputes with Abta and the CAA over what he saw as burdensome regulation. Former colleagues describe a smart negotiator, occasionally abrasive, with the confidence of his background, even if his vowels had become more estuary English over the years. In a cut-throat sector, his eye for the margins led him to relocate company operations to Poland as well as Palma. His decision to move to the Mediterranean was also personal: his wife is from Mallorca and her father still runs a large ground handling business there. Evans owns a house in Fulham, west London, as well as in the Balearics.",

The failure of Dunne Group leaves the futures of hundreds more subcontractors used by the company uncertain, with some of them owed pay. Tom MacLennan of FRP Advisory was appointed joint administrator on Tuesday. He said the group, which until then had been owned and run by its founder, Gordon Dunne, had overextended itself. \u201cThe business faced substantial trading losses on some contracts, leading to severe cash flow pressures ... Rapid expansion led to pressure on working capital and a requirement for significant additional funding that was not available.\u201d The group is understood to have bid aggressively for big, long-term contracts following the 2008 financial crisis, and since then it has struggled to keep costs sufficiently low to remain profitable. Among unprofitable contracts were those for some hospitals in Scotland. The group had been in an acute cash crisis for some weeks before the decision was made to call in administrators. Among major contract wins in recent years were those for work on three high-profile ongoing developments in London: the 48-storey Newington Butts tower in Elephant and Castle, a skyscraper office block at 100 Bishopsgate in the City, and One Blackfriars, a tower near Blackfriars Bridge on the Thames. The failed group\u2019s main assets are its plant and machinery, including some of the country\u2019s largest cranes. But much of that has been contractually locked in to specific development projects, meaning it may be many months before administrators will be able to sell the assets and return funds to creditors. The collapse of Dunne is expected to cause considerable disruption at a number of building sites. The construction union Ucatt urged Dunne workers to remain on site regardless of instructions from the company\u2019s head office. The union said it would call on the main contractors at each site to ensure workers were paid. Steve Dillon, the regional secretary of Ucatt Scotland, told The Construction Index: \u201cContractors and clients approved and appointed Dunne Group to undertake work on their projects. They should have made financial checks to ensure the company was stable. It should not be the workers who have to pick up the bill for the company\u2019s collapse.\u201d Just 16 staff have been retained by the administrators to help wind down the company\u2019s affairs and sell off assets.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As an electronics and systems engineer with several decades\u2019 experience in UK industry, I find Philip Hammond\u2019s unequivocal enthusiasm for the sale of ARM, our most valuable technology company, profoundly misjudged (Chancellor says UK is open for business as biggest tech firm sold overseas, 19 July). The pedigree of the ARM RISC processor architecture goes back to the BBC\u2019s computer literacy public service initiative of the early 1980s. Building on the considerable success of their BBC Micro used in that project led Acorn Computers to develop the initial ARM device \u2013 or the \u201cAcorn RISC Machine\u201d, as it was then known \u2013 to power its successor. The rest is history, and the ARM RISC processor concept took on a life of its own. Its great success has undoubtedly been a source of considerable inspiration and pride to those entering the electronics and computing professions in the UK \u2013 the US had Apple, Microsoft and HP Intel, to name a few, but we at least had ARM. It is difficult to imagine the US allowing those enterprises to fall so easily into foreign hands, but in \u201ccar boot sale\u201d Britain, making a quick profit, with apparently little or no proper analysis of the consequences, takes priority. Perhaps if there were more genuinely technically literate folk in government, with an understanding of the true long-term strategic and social value to the nation of successful technological enterprises such as ARM, things would be better? But not, it seems, under Mr Hammond (PPE, Oxford) or indeed Mrs May (Geography, Oxford). Brexit may perhaps give us our country back, but only to flog it off piecemeal to the highest bidder, it would appear. Wayne Rimmer Bromborough, Wirral \u2022 John Mills criticises the sell-off of ARM to Japanese investors (The ARM sell-off is bad for Britain, 19 July) as being against the interests of British working people. Philip Hammond says that \u201cBritain is open for business, and open to foreign investment\u201d. Following the logic of Mills\u2019 view, post-Brexit, like Canada, we could introduce a foreign investment screening law. This would allow the state to review foreign takeovers, considering their impact on the UK economy before allowing them to go forward, subject to contractual conditions. If we stay in the single market, such a law would be compatible with EU law, if limited to non-EU-origin investors. However, all British governments since the 1960s have reduced controls over foreign investment. Vince Cable could not persuade the last government to adopt such a law after Kraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury. Opposition to a foreign investment law could be expected to continue under the current government. If we are out of the EU, and dealing alone with foreign multinationals, we might need a Canadian-style foreign investment screening law. It is only at the point of entry that we have any real bargaining power with multinationals. Brexit might tilt the historic balance of policy towards such a law. The current liberal position might become politically unacceptable if multinationals do as they please, without binding commitments, putting UK firms, jobs and revenue at risk. Peter Muchlinski Emeritus professor of international commercial law, The School of Law, Soas, University of London \u2022 As a nation with a trade deficit of some 7% of GDP, it is obvious that we have to flog things off but I would like to make the case that it would be less culturally damaging to sell off Ely Cathedral than ARM Holdings. It might seem strange to those far from engineering but the creation of the technical and commercial basis of a company like ARM is more challenging than the construction of a cathedral. ARM was uniquely created from the fusion of two world-class academic engineering traditions: the computing architecture school at Manchester University descending from Alan Turing and the first stored-program electronic computers, and the brilliant but more eclectic and entrepreneurial school at Cambridge. It also benefited substantially from EEC research funding. For a company to break into the global computing market to the extent of having its chip design in 95% of mobile phones is a truly astounding achievement worthy of this great heritage, and unlikely to be repeated in our nation for many years to come. We shall be lucky to see another such in the next few decades. But we have quite a few cathedrals. Tom Lake Reading, Berkshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",

The pedigree of the ARM RISC processor architecture goes back to the BBC\u2019s computer literacy public service initiative of the early 1980s. Building on the considerable success of their BBC Micro used in that project led Acorn Computers to develop the initial ARM device \u2013 or the \u201cAcorn RISC Machine\u201d, as it was then known \u2013 to power its successor.</p> <p>The rest is history, and the ARM RISC processor concept took on a life of its own. Its great success has undoubtedly been a source of considerable inspiration and pride to those entering the electronics and computing professions in the UK \u2013 the US had Apple, Microsoft and HP Intel, to name a few, but we at least had ARM. It is difficult to imagine the US allowing those enterprises to fall so easily into foreign hands, but in \u201ccar boot sale\u201d Britain, making a quick profit, with apparently little or no proper analysis of the consequences, takes priority.</p> <p>Perhaps if there were more genuinely technically literate folk in government, with an understanding of the true long-term strategic and social value to the nation of successful technological enterprises such as ARM, things would be better? But not, it seems, under Mr Hammond (PPE, Oxford) or indeed Mrs May (Geography, Oxford). Brexit may perhaps give us our country back, but only to flog it off piecemeal to the&#xa0;highest bidder, it would appear.<br><strong>Wayne Rimmer</strong><br><em>Bromborough, Wirral</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Mills criticises the sell-off of ARM to Japanese investors (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/sell-off-british-businesses-must-stop\" title=\"\">The ARM sell-off is bad for Britain</a>, 19 July) as being against the interests of British working people. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/tech-giant-arm-holdings-sold-to-japanese-firm-for-24bn\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond says that \u201cBritain is open for business, and open to foreign investment\u201d. </a>Following the logic of Mills\u2019 view, post-Brexit, like Canada, we could introduce a foreign investment screening law. This would allow the state to review foreign takeovers, considering their impact on the UK economy before allowing them to go forward, subject to contractual conditions. If we stay in the single market, such a law would be compatible with EU law, if limited to non-EU-origin investors.</p> <p>However, all British governments since the 1960s have reduced controls over foreign investment. Vince Cable could not persuade the last government to adopt such a law after Kraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury. Opposition to a foreign investment law could be expected to continue under the current government.</p> <p>If we are out of the EU, and dealing alone with foreign multinationals, we might need a Canadian-style foreign investment screening law. It is only at the point of entry that we have any real bargaining power with multinationals. Brexit might tilt the historic balance of policy towards such a law. The current liberal position might become politically unacceptable if multinationals do as they please, without binding commitments, putting UK firms, jobs and revenue at risk.<br><strong>Peter Muchlinski</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of international commercial law, The School of Law, Soas, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a nation with a trade deficit of some 7% of&#xa0;GDP, it is obvious that we have to flog things off but I would like to make the case that it would be less culturally damaging to sell off Ely Cathedral than ARM Holdings.</p> <p>It might seem strange to those far from engineering but the creation of the technical and commercial basis of a company like ARM is more challenging than the construction of a cathedral.

      "bodyText": "The \u00a324.3bn takeover of ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology company, could be in doubt after investors in the Japanese group behind the deal \u2013 SoftBank \u2013 gave it the thumbs down. Shares in SoftBank fell by more than 10% in Japan as investors and analysts expressed concerns about the price of the deal and the increasing debt of the telecoms and tech group. The acquisition of ARM would be the biggest deal yet for SoftBank and its charismatic founder, Masayoshi Son, but SoftBank already has $113bn (\u00a386bn) of debt. \u201cA fresh acquisition is not what the market wants from SoftBank,\u201d Mitsushige Akino, the chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr Son\u2019s style to keep expanding, but isn\u2019t he stretching too much?\u201d Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies, added: \u201cTo us, the ARM acquisition announced yesterday [Monday] appears largely inconsistent with SoftBank\u2019s investment strategy. It does not inspire much confidence and requires deeper review.\u201d The proposed deal for ARM has given Theresa May, the new British prime minister, a dilemma less than a week into her new government. May and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, have welcomed the deal as a sign that international investors are still willing to invest in the UK after the EU referendum. However, critics claim that the UK should not give up ownership of one of its few world-leading companies. ARM designs the chips that power more than 95% of smartphones around the world and its technology is effectively the brains behind the iPhone. Hermann Hauser, who helped to found ARM in 1990, said that SoftBank\u2019s debt mountain meant that some of the money earned by ARM could be used to pay interest or reduce debt, rather than be invested back in the company. \u201cIf [ARM were] allowed to remain independent, all that cash could be ploughed into further development, now some of it will have to be spent on servicing debt,\u201d Hauser said. Son dismissed concerns from SoftBank shareholders at a press conference in London on Monday. \u201cIf the investors do not like it, they will sell,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the largest shareholder in SoftBank. I share the same interest as the other shareholders.\u201d Later, in a conference call with investors, Son evoked Star Wars to try to persuade them to back his plan and invest in SoftBank. \u201cIf you listen to the force, this is the best company to invest in the debt,\u201d he said. Son owns 19% of SoftBank and has faced criticism about his deals before, notably in October 2012 when the company revealed a $22bn plan to take control of US mobile phone network Sprint. This was the last time that SoftBank\u2019s shares fell as heavily as they did on Tuesday, when they closed down 10.3% to \u00a55,387 (\u00a334.70), their lowest since March. Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft and Google could emerge as rival bidders for ARM. \u201cSoftbank themselves did a poor job explaining the rationale on the conference call in our view and it seems to have been an opportunistic strike. \u201cARM is an awesome asset we think and, if they execute and keep the culture as promised then, in 10 years time it may look to be a masterstroke. But short term is a different matter. \u201cThe other thing is: there is no break-up fee, no lock in. ARM has opened the doors to a counter in our view. And the more we think about it the more likely and sensible it is for others to run the rule over this.\u201d SoftBank is offering a \u00a317 a share for ARM. This is 43% higher than its closing share price last week and 63% higher than ARM\u2019s share price before the EU referendum. Shares in ARM have risen sharply since Britain voted for Brexit because the weakness in sterling has made ARM\u2019s profits in the US and abroad more valuable. ARM conducts less than 1% of its business in the UK.",

Rolls-Royce, Petrofac and Halliburton are among the dozens of multinationals reported to have hired Unaoil, which acts as an agent to help companies secure business in unfamiliar overseas markets. Authorities in Monaco raided the firm\u2019s office in April following the publication of reports by Fairfax Media and the Huffington Post based on hundreds of thousands of leaked internal emails and documents. The raids were reportedly carried out at the behest of the Serious Fraud Office, which at the time had declined to confirm its involvement. Emails published by Fairfax described how Unaoil staff allegedly used codenames such as \u201cLighthouse\u201d, \u201cIvan\u201d, \u201cM\u201d and \u201cTeacher\u201d to obliquely refer to high-level contacts in the Iraqi state oil company. The company operated in countries all over the world, including Angola, Azerbaijan and Libya. \u201cThe SFO is conducting a criminal investigation into the activities of Unaoil, its officers, its employees and its agents in connection with suspected offences of bribery, corruption and money laundering,\u201d the SFO said in a statement released earlier today. \u201cWe have been approached by a number of sources who may have information relevant to this investigation. If you have any information please contact us through our secure and confidential reporting channel.\u201d The SFO investigation into Unaoil began in March this year. The company has expressly denied the corruption allegations and says it will sue Fairfax Media. When asked by reporters if his firm had paid bribes, its chief executive, Ata Ahsani, said: \u201cThe answer is absolutely no.\u201d Unaoil had no comment on the SFO\u2019s statement on Tuesday. Although headquartered in Monaco, several of the Unaoil group of companies were in fact incorporated in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands by the law firm behind the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca. The documents revealed that Unaoil had been hired by the oil giant BP for business in Iraq, even after press reports of Unaoil being implicated in corruption in the country had already emerged. A copy of a contract found in the Panama Papers revealed that BP had signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Unaoil for the provision of engineering services at the Kirkuk oil field in northern Iraq. BP confirmed that it had hired Unaoil, but declined to answer questions on whether its compliance department had approved the contract. Unaoil said that BP had undertaken \u201can exhaustive due diligence review\u201d before signing the contract and that no part of its fee had been intended for payment to officials in connection with the Kirkuk project.",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s another view on the IMF\u2019s latest pronouncements, from Capital Economics. The research company\u2019s Michael Pearce said: After spending the run-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum warning that Brexit would cause \u201csevere regional and global damage\u201d, the IMF all but admitted on Tuesday that it had been bluffing, forecasting that the impact would be largely benign after all. The IMF downgraded its forecasts for global growth this year and next by just 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1% and 3.4% respectively. The biggest downward revision was of course to the UK, which the Fund now expects to grow by just 1.3% in 2017, almost a percentage point slower than its previous forecast. But even this is not as bad as the recession many commentators had warned of. Meanwhile, the IMF nudged down its forecast for growth in the euro-zone next year by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for economies further afield was \u201clittle affected\u201d by the Brexit vote. So much for the IMF\u2019s claim that there would be \u201csevere damage.\u201d Admittedly, the Fund did warn of a more disorderly outcome from Brexit, providing two alternative scenarios in which global growth stalls or slows further. However IMF Chief Economist, Maurice Obstfeld, acknowledged that these would require the impact on global trade to be \u201cgreater than [the IMF] thinks likely\u201d while financial conditions would need to deteriorate far more than they had done so far... Instead of Brexit, prospects for the world economy will be shaped far more by the outlook for China and the US. Recent data suggest that growth in both economies is holding up fairly well. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Deutsche Bank has had its credit rating cut from stable to negative by S&amp;P Global Ratings. It said: The outlook revision reflects our view that the unfavorable operating environment poses particular challenges to Deutsche Bank as it implements its 2016-2020 strategic plan. Although market conditions may recover somewhat from the weak first quarter of 2016, ultra-low interest rates and generally subdued client trading activity may persist for the foreseeable future. These pressures affect the entire sector but we believe they are particularly unhelpful for Deutsche Bank as it seeks to strengthen capital and maintain its franchise while fundamentally restructuring its business model and balance sheet... The U.K.\u2019s recent vote to leave the EU (Brexit) is a consideration in the outlook revision, but not a prominent one. We consider that Deutsche Bank should not be materially affected if the U.K. were to lose access to the EU financial services passporting arrangement, although it may need to relocate some activities from its large London branch. We assume Deutsche Bank\u2019s trading revenues received a boost from Brexit-related market volatility but, in the longer term, we see Brexit as a factor that may prolong the current period of ultra-low global interest rates and depressed business volumes. An uncertain day saw markets struggle for direction, but recover from their their worst levels. Global worries continued, with a further clampdown in Turkey in the wake of the recent coup attempt sending the lira tumbling, and concerns about the recent spate of terror attacks adding to the downbeat mood. On the economic front, UK inflation came in higher than expected, but after an initial move higher for the pound, investors decided that the Bank of England was still likely to plump for a rate cut in August despite the new data. German investor confidence fell sharply, hitting the Dax and other European markets, but strong US housing starts prompted further talk of a US rate hike and gave further support to the dollar. In turn the gains in the US currency put pressure on commodity prices including oil. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up virtually unchanged, up just 0.03% or 1.95 points at 6697.37 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.81% to 9981.24 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.63% at 4330.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.53% to 16,673.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.46% to 8485.2 But Portugal\u2019s PSI20 put on 0.35% to 4591.93 And in Greece, the Athens market added 1.53% to 563.75 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 20 points or 0.11%. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 is continuing to toy with that 6,700 level but to be almost 4 weeks on from the shock of that Brexit vote and have the index seemingly in such good health \u2013 admittedly it\u2019s flattered by a weak pound too \u2013 is certainly something worth noting. The Turkish lira has tumbled as the government continues to take action in the wake of the failed coup. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Turkish lira has dropped sharply as the government continues to purge vast swathes of the establishment, risking a level of destabilisation that could seriously derail economic growth. The Turkey Education Ministry reportedly suspended 15,200 staff whilst 1,577 university deans have been asked to resign. Here\u2019s the UK Treasury response to the IMF world economic outlook: Brexit is negative for the UK\u2019s higher education sector and NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, according to ratings agency Fitch, due to the likely impact on staff and research funding. In a new report the agency says: As we have stated previously, the full impact of Brexit, and any potential ratings impact, will depend on the exit terms negotiated, which remain uncertain. For the higher education sector, a favourable exit deal would limit the reduction in research grants from EU funds. Even so, restrictions on free movement could reduce projected student demand and increase pressure on universities\u2019 revenues. The impact may be greater on English than on Scottish universities due to their different tuition fee arrangements for non-UK EU students, although we do not currently rate any Scottish universities. Unfavourable exit terms for universities could be rating negative, primarily due to lower research grants from EU funds. This would hinder the recruitment and retention of academic talent and could create difficulties in collaborating with EU countries on international research development. Press reports indicate that some UK institutions and academics have been asked to withdraw from applications for joint EU-funded research projects by their EU partners. This would reduce their appeal to more lucrative international students. UK Universities could also lose access to EU regional development, structural and cohesion funds to build new infrastructure. Modernization and expansion to attract overseas students is one reason sector debt has increased, reaching 26% of income in FY14. Reductions in EU funding could be mitigated by savings on contributions for EU funding from the UK government. However, EU funding has significantly risen in the last five years to 15% or more of UK universities\u2019 total revenue, while Britain\u2019s own national research budget is below international averages and is facing existing pressure. On the health service - a contentious issue during the referendum campaign of course - Fitch says: For the NHS, staffing is a key Brexit-related issue: 55,000 of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million workforce and 80,000 of the 1.3 million workers in adult social care come from the EU. The NHS is struggling to recruit enough staff, with a shortage of about 50,000 staff. The ability of providers and social care services to recruit EU staff will be crucial for Trusts and FTs to maintain patient care income from NHS Commissioners. The UK has been able to develop its medical research through collaboration across the EU in the same way that higher education has benefitted from access to European talent and funding. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed GBP5.4bn to EU R&amp;D, while it received GBP8.8bn from the EU for R&amp;D and innovation. As it is unlikely that NHS Trusts and FTs would be able to cover the shortfall if EU funds were no longer available, funds spent on R&amp;D would probably be significantly reduced. The IMF is not forecasting a recession for the UK following Brexit although it is still a possibility. Earlier the European Commission issued its own forecasts, and suggested Britain\u2019s economy could indeed fall into recession next year. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s economy may slip into recession next year following the vote to quit the European Union, the European Commission estimated on Tuesday in its first assessment of the economic impact of Brexit. Last week the commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said the cumulative negative impact for British gross domestic product (GDP) would be between about 1 percent and 2.5 percent by 2017. Estimates prepared by the EU executive staff and released on Tuesday give more precise figures than those provided by Moscovici and add a breakdown for this and next year. Britain is expected to endure a \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d which will limit its economic growth to between 1.3 and 1.6 percent this year, lower than earlier estimates of a 1.8 percent growth. The European Commission\u2019s simulations project a much worse situation for next year, when Britain may experience a 0.3 percent contraction in the worst scenario. In the most optimistic scenario Britain\u2019s gross domestic product would grow 1.1 percent in 2017, still much less than the previously forecast 1.9 percent rise. Back with the IMF and asked about Japan, Maury Obstfeld says there has been currency volatility but he would not characterise conditions as \u201cdisorderly.\u201d Japanese growth and the 2% inflation target face challenges, he says, but he does not view currency intervention as a necessary or useful policy. US markets are marginally lower in early trading despite oil price weakness and disappointing results overnight from Netflix. But positive earnings statements from Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson have helped limit the damage. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down just 2 points, helping other markets come off their worst levels. Indeed, the FTSE 100 is now up on the day, albeit only by 13 points while Germany and France have recovered some ground although both are still down around 0.8%. On Turkey, Maury Obstfeld says the IMF is monitoring the potential economic fallout of the failed coup attempt. We have seen some market volatility but we would anticipate that things will settle down. Turning to the G20, he says monetary policy has been bearing to much of the burden for growth and that more structural reforms are required. Obstfeld says uncertainty surrounding Brexit is particularly acute, partly because it is unclear what trade agreements the UK will be able to secure outside the EU. Naturally the greatest effects of Brexit will be felt in the UK. The real effects of Brexit will play out over a number of months, giving an added layer of uncertainty. He says the move by central banks to make additional liquidity available has helped to limit negative market reaction to the Brexit vote. There are other risks to the global economy, Obstfeld says, including geopolitical risks and high long-term unemployment. Policymakers should not accept low growth rates as the new normal. A slow growth environment will increase social tensions. Obstfeld is saying that politicians in particular must make it their mission to dispel the idea that all ills stem from the globalisation of markets. Maury Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, is giving a press conference. You can watch it here. Here is our full story on the IMF\u2019s downgrades: The dollar has risen to a four-month high against a basket of currencies following figures that showed a bigger-than-expected rise in housing starts. Housing starts at an annual rate of 1.19 million new homes in the year ending in June, up 4.8% according to the Commerce Department. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency agains six major currencies, rose to 97.125, its highest level since mid March. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has sharply lowered its forecasts for UK growth and says Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has \u201cthrown a spanner in the works\u201d. The Washington-based fund cut its forecast for UK growth in 2017 to 1.3% from an earlier forecast of 2.2% as the impact of the vote is felt. UK growth this year is expected to be 1.7%, 0.2 points lower than the IMF\u2019s previous forecast. Global growth is forecast to rise by 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017, a 0.1 point cut for both years. According to Maury Obstfeld, IMF chief economist: Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works. The report adds: The Brexit vote implies a substantial increase in economic, political, and institutional uncertainty, which is projected to have negative macroeconomic consequences, especially in advanced European economies. The IMF says the UK and Europe will be worst hit by the Brexit fallout, but the effects will be felt around the world. Had it not been for Brexit, the IMF was prepared to leave its outlook for this year broadly unchanged as better-than-expected euro-area performance offset disappointing US first-quarter growth. The IMF also had been prepared to raise its outlook for 2017 slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, on the back of improved performance in a few big emerging markets, in particular Brazil and Russia. The European Commission has fined Daimler, Volvo/Renault and two other truck makers a record \u20ac2.93bn (\u00a32.5bn) for colluding on prices and passing the costs of emissions rules on to customers. Full story here: IG\u2019s opening calls for Wall Street: The IMF\u2019s update on the world economic outlook is coming up at 2pm UK time. UK house prices increased 1.1% between April and May, the ONS reported earlier, with the average price of a home rising to \u00a3211,000. Over the year they rose by 16,000 or 8.1% - the same rate of annual growth as April. The biggest increases were in London and the south east. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says strong growth in house prices is \u201cunlikely to persist\u201d following the Brexit vote, predicting a 3% drop over the next year. Indicators of demand at the beginning of the home purchase process weakened sharply during the second quarter and have plunged since referendum. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are likely to edge up soon as banks price in higher default risk and pass on recent increases in their funding costs. Prices in London and the South East, up 13.6% and 12.9% year-over-year respectively in May, look particularly vulnerable, because the outlook for employment in the financial services sector has darkened and banks will think twice about high loan-to-income lending. As a result, we think that house prices are set to fall by about 3% from current levels over the next year. The new chancellor Philip Hammond says any immediate response to the surprise Brexit vote should come from the Bank of England. Taking his first Treasury questions as chancellor, Hammond said he would unveil fiscal plans to deal with a possible slowdown in the autumn. The initial response to this kind of shock must be a monetary response delivered by the Bank of England. And the governor, announcing that interest rates were not to be lowered last week, did make it clear that the Bank is developing a monetary package that it will announce in due course. The Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates in August, despite the stronger-than-expected rise in inflation in June. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee surprised the City last week when it left rates on hold at 0.5% and announced no other measures to stimulate the economy in the post referendum world. Governor Mark Carney has been explicit that he expects loosening of policy over the summer, and economists have shifted their expectation to a move in August. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says the weak ZEW survey in Germany signals there is more concern about the fallout from Brexit than markets suggest. July\u2019s German ZEW Survey, which was conducted over the past two weeks, suggests that investors are more worried about the effects of Brexit on the German economy than the financial market response has so far implied. The Economic Sentiment Indicator [on the ZEW] is now at its lowest level since November 2012 when Germany was in recession. And the fact that it is below zero means that most investors expect economic conditions to deteriorate over the next six months. On the basis of its past loose relationship with GDP growth, the ESI looks consistent with falls in GDP. Britain should be prepared for higher inflation in the coming months following its vote to leave the EU, economists are warning. The Bank of England\u2019s target for inflation is 2%, so we\u2019re still a way off that but perhaps not for much longer given the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote should increase import prices. Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown describes the rise in inflation to 0.5% in June as \u201cthe calm before the storm\u201d. Sterling\u2019s weakness means higher import prices, and this is expected to feed through to significantly higher inflation figures in the coming months. Forecasts suggest it could reach 3-4%. However, this will be a temporary factor: assuming sterling remains weak, the effect will fall out of the year-on-year calculation in the second half of next year. Brettell says that as a result, Bank of England policymakers are likely to discount a short-term spike in inflation. Underlying inflationary pressure is hard to see, with Brexit-related economic uncertainty likely to dampen both consumer spending and wage growth in the short term. As such the Bank of England is almost certain to ignore what should be a temporary spike in inflation when it sets monetary policy. The weak German ZEW survey will add to investor jitters. Market falls have accelerated since early trading: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,662 FTSE 250: -0.4% at 16,803 Euro Stoxx 600: -0.9% at 336 Gemany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 9,936 French CAC: -1.1% at 4,312 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 16,456 Spanish IBEX: -0.7% at 8,466 Andrew Bailey has told the public meeting of the Financial Conduct Authority that access to the single market post-Brexit is important. Speaking in his new role as chief executive of the regulator, Bailey told the members of the public assembled in the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in London that the regulator was also keen for trade arrangements with other countries too. At the same time, he told the meeting that the current rules had to remain in place - including the bonus cap - and that Brexit did not \u201clead to a bonfire of regulation\u201d. He said: \u201cI welcome the chancellor\u2019s statement that the UK will seek access to the single market through the coming negotiations. We will support the government\u2019s work to put in place new arrangements, and I would include in that, alongside access to the single market, seeking to have in place agreements with other countries. From an FCA perspective, there is, for instance, no doubt that our objective of ensuring healthy competition in UK financial markets is supported by cross-border trade in these financial services\u201d. Confidence among German investors and analysts fell sharply in July as a result of the uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The result of the 23 June referendum sent shockwaves across Europe and hit confidence in the region\u2019s largest economy more than expected. Economic sentiment on Germany\u2019s closely watched ZEW index fell to -6.8 in July, from 19.2 in June. Economists polled by Reuters were predicting a smaller fall to 9. The current conditions measure of the ZEW also fell more than expected, to 49.8 in July from 54.5 in May. Florian Hense, economist at German bank Berenberg, said the Brexit vote had taken the ZEW back down to euro crisis levels. The data comes two days before the ECB\u2019s governing council makes its latest policy decision. Hense: While monthly data are volatile, this reading will be valuable for policymakers in Frankfurt. It is the first reading for the eurozone\u2019s economy since June 23. The first reading of the economy is somewhat in contrast to market developments. When the ECB\u2019s governing council convenes on Thursday for its monetary policy meeting, they will acknowledge that market moves so far have been relatively orderly and sovereign bond yields, particularly in the Eurozone periphery, signal limited contagion risk. But today\u2019s soft data will be some cause for concern, supporting our view that Draghi\u2019s press conference will take a dovish tone. Here is our full story on this morning\u2019s inflation data, from the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott: Fans of Pokemon Go get carried away in Australia: In corporate news, the market value of Nintendo has more than doubled since the release of its Pokemon Go game earlier this month. The Japanese company now has a 4.5tn yen (\u00a332bn) market capitalisation, with investors rushing to buy the shares following the huge success of the game. The ONS says Euro 2016 was probably behind the 10.9% spike in air fares in June. Phil Gooding, ONS statistician: The rising cost of European air flights, possibly boosted by the Euro football championships, was the biggest reason for this month\u2019s increase in inflation. The growing cost of oil, feeding through to petrol prices, also helped nudge up CPI. Today\u2019s figures were collected before the EU referendum, so recent falls in the value of the pound will have had no impact on them. The rise in annual inflation to 0.5% in June was driven largely by higher air fares and petrol prices, as well as games and toys. The last time inflation was higher than 0.5% was November 2014, when it was 1%. A 10.9% increase in air fares was the biggest May to June rise on record. Prices increased on European routes in particular. Petrol and diesel prices rose by 2.3p and 2.6pm per litre. Prices in the recreation and culture category increased by 0.6%, with toys and games, particularly computer games, driving the rise. Breaking: UK annual inflation increased to 0.5% in June from 0.3% in May. That was a bigger than expected rise, with economists predicting 0.4%. Government borrowing will be \u00a320bn higher this year than the \u00a355bn forecast in the March budget, according to a forecast by RBC Capital Markets. Sam Hill, economist at RBC, said comments made by Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, suggested he was in favour of fiscal loosening to support investment. The new Chancellor\u2019s early comments point towards fiscal policy loosening focused towards investment. This would fit well with a return to the more conventional fiscal rule adopted in the early days of the Cameron/Osborne era. The pound is down this morning before the latest UK inflation data at 9.30am. It has dipped below $1.32, falling 0.6% against the dollar to $1.3175. Sterling is also down 0.4% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1914. Any impact of comments made by Martin Weale - a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 on Monday appear to have faded. Weale suggested a cut in UK interest rates in August was not a foregone conclusion. One of nine MPC members, Weale\u2019s voting record suggests he is traditionally more in favour of raising rates than the majority of other members. Markets have opened down this morning, as geopolitical tensions create uncertainty. The FTSE 100 is off 20 points or 0.3% at 6,677, while the FTSE 250 is down 0.2% at 16,836. All major European indices are down, apart from the Spanish IBEX which is roughly flat. UK inflation data is expected to show a pick up in the annual rate in June. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting to see the headline rate increase to 0.4% from 0.3% in May, partly because of an increase in petrol prices between the two months. The data was collected by the Office for National Statistics before the 23 June EU referendum. As a result, the fall in the value of the pound since the vote will not have fed through to the official inflation data as yet. As Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, explains: In light of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU all pre-referendum releases including this one look particularly historic and the question now is over the extent to which the slump in the pound supports a faster recovery of inflation to target, despite some likely further drag from a weaker domestic demand picture. Our central view is that inflation will head north quite rapidly for a time, but that this sterling boost will be a temporary phenomenon. The ONS will also publish its house price index for May at 9.30am. In Germany, the closely watched ZEW survey for July will provide insight into whether the Brexit vote has dampened confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Later in the US, housing starts data for June will be an indicator of how the property market is performing and its wider implications for the economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes will be on the IMF today as it provides its latest update on the global economy. The Washington-based Fund, headed by Christine Lagarde, is expected to downgrade its previous prediction that the global economy will grow by 3.5% in 2017. It is also expected to cut its 2017 UK growth forecast from its previous prediction of 2.2%. Lagarde was a vocal opponent of Brexit in the run-up to the 23 June referendum, warning the UK of a possible housing and stock market crash. It is likely that the IMF will say in today\u2019s report the vote to leave the EU has increased uncertainty for the global outlook. The update will be published at 2pm UK time.",

The research company\u2019s Michael Pearce said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After spending the run-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum warning that Brexit would cause \u201csevere regional and global damage\u201d, the IMF all but admitted on Tuesday that it had been bluffing, forecasting that the impact would be largely benign after all. </p> <p>The IMF downgraded its forecasts for global growth this year and next by just 0.1 percentage point, to 3.1% and 3.4% respectively. The biggest downward revision was of course to the UK, which the Fund now expects to grow by just 1.3% in 2017, almost a percentage point slower than its previous forecast. But even this is not as bad as the recession many commentators had warned of.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the IMF nudged down its forecast for growth in the euro-zone next year by 0.2 percentage points, while the forecast for economies further afield was \u201clittle affected\u201d by the Brexit vote. So much for the IMF\u2019s claim that there would be \u201csevere damage.\u201d</p> <p>Admittedly, the Fund did warn of a more disorderly outcome from Brexit, providing two alternative scenarios in which global growth stalls or slows further. However IMF Chief Economist, Maurice Obstfeld, acknowledged that these would require the impact on global trade to be \u201cgreater than [the IMF] thinks likely\u201d while financial conditions would need to deteriorate far more than they had done so far...</p> <p>Instead of Brexit, prospects for the world economy will be shaped far more by the outlook for China and the US. Recent data suggest that growth in both economies is holding up fairly well. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The outlook revision reflects our view that the unfavorable operating environment poses particular challenges to Deutsche Bank as it implements its 2016-2020 strategic plan. Although market conditions may recover somewhat from the weak first quarter of 2016, ultra-low interest rates and generally subdued client trading activity may persist for the foreseeable future. These pressures affect the entire sector but we believe they are particularly unhelpful for Deutsche Bank as it seeks to strengthen capital and maintain its franchise while fundamentally restructuring its business model and balance sheet...</p> <p>The U.K.\u2019s recent vote to leave the EU (Brexit) is a consideration in the outlook revision, but not a prominent one. We consider that Deutsche Bank should not be materially affected if the U.K. were to lose access to the EU financial services passporting arrangement, although it may need to relocate some activities from its large London branch. We assume Deutsche Bank\u2019s trading revenues received a boost from Brexit-related market volatility but, in the longer term, we see Brexit as a factor that may prolong the current period of ultra-low global interest rates and depressed business volumes. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/755438750654668800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">S&amp;P cut Deutsche Bank outlook to negative, citing difficult environment.

In a new report the agency says:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we have stated previously, the full impact of Brexit, and any potential ratings impact, will depend on the exit terms negotiated, which remain uncertain. For the higher education sector, a favourable exit deal would limit the reduction in research grants from EU funds. Even so, restrictions on free movement could reduce projected student demand and increase pressure on universities\u2019 revenues. The impact may be greater on English than on Scottish universities due to their different tuition fee arrangements for non-UK EU students, although we do not currently rate any Scottish universities.</p> <p>Unfavourable exit terms for universities could be rating negative, primarily due to lower research grants from EU funds. This would hinder the recruitment and retention of academic talent and could create difficulties in collaborating with EU countries on international research development. Press reports indicate that some UK institutions and academics have been asked to withdraw from applications for joint EU-funded research projects by their EU partners. This would reduce their appeal to more lucrative international students.</p> <p>UK Universities could also lose access to EU regional development, structural and cohesion funds to build new infrastructure. Modernization and expansion to attract overseas students is one reason sector debt has increased, reaching 26% of income in FY14.</p> <p>Reductions in EU funding could be mitigated by savings on contributions for EU funding from the UK government. However, EU funding has significantly risen in the last five years to 15% or more of UK universities\u2019 total revenue, while Britain\u2019s own national research budget is below international averages and is facing existing pressure.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the health service - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\"><strong>a contentious issue during the referendum campaign of course</strong></a> - Fitch says:</p> <blockquote> <p>For the NHS, staffing is a key Brexit-related issue: 55,000 of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million workforce and 80,000 of the 1.3 million workers in adult social care come from the EU. The NHS is struggling to recruit enough staff, with a shortage of about 50,000 staff. The ability of providers and social care services to recruit EU staff will be crucial for Trusts and FTs to maintain patient care income from NHS Commissioners.</p> <p>The UK has been able to develop its medical research through collaboration across the EU in the same way that higher education has benefitted from access to European talent and funding. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed GBP5.4bn to EU R&amp;D, while it received GBP8.8bn from the EU for R&amp;D and innovation. As it is unlikely that NHS Trusts and FTs would be able to cover the shortfall if EU funds were no longer available, funds spent on R&amp;D would probably be significantly reduced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578e3018e4b0ec4df2a16fa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-19T13:59:02.858Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF is not forecasting a recession for the UK following Brexit although it is still a possibility.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has fined Daimler, Volvo/Renault and two other truckmakers a record \u20ac2.93bn (\u00a32.5bn) for colluding on prices and passing the costs of emissions rules on to customers. The cartel, which also comprised MAN, Iveco and DAF, operated between 1997 and 2011 to increase factory prices of medium and heavy trucks in the European Economic Area, the commission said. They also colluded on when to introduce emissions technologies and charged customers for these measures on trucks weighing 6 tonnes or more. The manufacturers, which make about 90% of trucks in Europe, did not seek to avoid or rig the standards, but delays meant that customers missed out on innovative technology, the commission said. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said: \u201cA meeting in Brussels was the starting point for this long-lasting truck cartel. The first meeting was organised right here in January 1997, in what seems to be a cosy hotel. It was the beginning of a 14-year-long collusion.\u201d Senior management then colluded at meetings on the fringes of trade fairs and other events, and held discussions by phone. From 2004, the cartel was run by lower level managers through the companies\u2019 German subsidiaries and information was exchanged by email. MAN, owned by Volkswagen, came forward to reveal the existence of the cartel and avoided a fine of about \u20ac1.2bn. The biggest penalty of \u20ac1bn was imposed on Daimler. Dutch company DAF\u2019s fine is \u20ac753m, Volvo/Renault will pay \u20ac670m and Italy\u2019s Iveco will pay \u20ac495m. Vestager declined to say how far up the companies the collusion went, describing those involved simply as senior management. She said MAN\u2019s decision to come forward showed that partners in a cartel could not trust each other. \u201cIt pays off to denounce a cartel and to put an end to your participation and to cooperate with the commission. It\u2019s the best and cheapest thing not to participate in a cartel,\u201d she said. The fines were more than double the previous record for a cartel and would have been larger if the companies had refused to cooperate. Vestager said the size of the total penalty reflected the large market involved and the long duration of the collusive behaviour. The highest previous fine for collusion between companies was \u20ac1.4bn imposed on a TV and computer monitor tubes cartel in 2012. Volkswagen-owned Scania, of Sweden, is still under investigation after not taking part in the settlement following the announcement of the commission\u2019s investigation in November 2014. Rachel Adcox, a partner at US law firm Axinn Veltrop &amp; Harkrider, said: \u201cThese are large companies in an industry that generates significant revenues. The striking thing is the period of time over which the cartel is alleged to have taken place.\u201d Adcox said it was not surprising that cartel members conducted their activities by email given that such communications are traceable. \u201cIt\u2019s more common than you would think \u2026 Email has become an important tool for investigators because evidence of a cartel from even 10 or 15 years ago can be recovered,\u201d she said. Vestager said the 30m trucks on European roads make up three-quarters of the inland transport of goods and that it is important for the economy that there is competition between manufacturers. \u201cWe have today put down a marker by imposing record fines for a serious infringement. It is not acceptable that MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco and DAF were part of a cartel instead of competing with each other. For 14 years, they colluded on the pricing and on passing on the costs for meeting environmental standards to customers. This is also a clear message to companies that cartels are not accepted.\u201d The commission said it found no link between the cartel and the use of defeat devices to manipulate emissions tests. Volkswagen admitted last year that it had used the devices to under-report emissions from its diesel vehicles in tests. Customers will be able to bring civil claims for damages against the companies in national courts. The commission\u2019s antitrust directive, which must take effect by the end of 2016, is designed to make it easier for victims of anti-competitive behaviour to receive damages.",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 latest quarterly profits have rebounded 78% from its worst quarterly results in five years but the bank is continuing to cut its bonus pool for Wall Street workers. On Tuesday the bank reported a healthy increase in second-quarter profits, as trading recovered from a dismal first quarter that had forced the bank to lay off hundreds of employees and cut costs across the board. The bank said net income in the second quarter came in at $1.82bn, up from $1.05bn in the same period a year earlier. A large part of the increase was due to the bank paying a $1.45bn fine for the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities last year. While profits have recovered, revenue dropped 13% to $9.1bn. The drop in revenue will be passed on to staff via smaller, but still huge, bonuses. The bank set aside $3.3bn to pay salaries and bonuses, down from $3.8bn in the same period last year. This equates to about $96,000 per employee for this quarter. The second-quarter bonus cut comes on top of a 40% cut to compensation in the previous quarter. \u201cDespite the uncertainty created by Brexit, we achieved solid results by continuing to serve our clients across our diversified franchise and by managing our business efficiently,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a very brief statement. Blankfein, 61, is trying to reshape the bank after last quarter suffering its worst quarterly performance since 2011, which has led to more than 400 job cuts. The bank, whose services had previously only been available to large companies, governments and billionaires, recently launched an online banking service for anyone with $1m minimum to deposit. Goldman\u2019s shares, which have fallen more than 9% so far this year, opened down 1.3% to $162.",

The second-quarter bonus cut comes on top of a 40% cut to compensation in the previous quarter.</p> <p>\u201cDespite the uncertainty created by Brexit, we achieved solid results by continuing to serve our clients across our diversified franchise and by managing our business efficiently,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2016-q2-results.pdf\">a very brief statement</a>. </p> <p>Blankfein, 61, is trying to reshape the bank after last quarter suffering its worst quarterly performance since 2011, which has led to more than 400 job cuts. </p> <p>The bank, whose services had previously only been available to large companies, governments and billionaires, recently <a href=\"https://www.gsbank.com/en.html\">launched an online banking service for anyone with $1m minimum to deposit</a>. </p> <p>Goldman\u2019s shares, which have fallen more than 9% so far this year, opened down 1.3% to $162. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of workers are to lose their jobs as the lossmaking fashion chain Store Twenty One prepares to close nearly 80 shops as part of a rescue deal with landlords. The retailer persuaded landlords for 17 of its 202 stores to take a 25% rent cut and landlords for more than 80 other stores to accept monthly rents in a bid to fend off administration. But 77 stores will shut within three months under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency, accepted by creditors late last week. Store Twenty One\u2019s owner, the Indian group Grabal Alok, said the outlets were unviable and did not have \u201cany prospect of being restored to viability even if a reduction in the amount of rent is obtained\u201d. The group\u2019s Bewise and QS businesses have already called in administrators leading to the closure of 17 stores previously leased by Store Twenty One, and a further 25 are at risk. Pravin Soni, the director of Store Twenty One, said: \u201cWe would like to thank all of our employees, creditors and other stakeholders for their support, in what we know has been a very difficult time. The directors and management team now look forward to focusing on the future of Store Twenty One and working with everyone to make this business a success for many years to come.\u201d Documents provided to creditors ahead of the CVA reveal that Store Twenty One has made a loss every year since Alok acquired it in 2007. The company said it would have fallen into administration or liquidation if landlords had not agreed the CVA as Store Twenty One owed more than \u00a32.6m in tax to HMRC and was being pursued for unpaid business rates by several local authorities. Store Twenty One blamed its problems on the economic downturn, which it said had \u201ca significant adverse impact\u201d on trading performance. It also said increased competition from online retailers, supermarkets and discounters including Primark had hit the business. Store Twenty One started in the 1930s as a manufacturer supplying retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer. It subsequently opened its own shops, selling seconds, but changed tack in the 1980s when it rebranded the chain as QS. In 1990 it floated on the London Stock Exchange and went on to acquire Bewise. It was taken private in 2002 and sold again, to Alok, five years later. The retailer, based in Solihull in the West Midlands, was rebranded again as Store Twenty One nearly a decade ago after a restructuring that involved the closure of 140 shops.",

      "bodyText": "SoftBank lost more than a tenth of its market value as the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s shareholders gave an initial thumbs down to its \u00a324bn takeover of the UK\u2019s ARM Holdings. The all-cash deal for Britain\u2019s most successful technology company, announced on Monday, is SoftBank\u2019s biggest acquisition and adds more debt to the already significant borrowing of the telecoms and technology group. SoftBank said buying ARM\u2019s chip design prowess would make it a leader in developing the internet of things, which promises to let objects such as buildings, cars and fridges connect with each other. The company secured a recommendation from ARM\u2019s board for its offer by paying \u00a317 a share \u2013 a hefty 43% over ARM\u2019s closing share price on Friday. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, welcomed the deal after SoftBank guaranteed to keep ARM as an independently run business in Cambridge and double its UK workforce by 2020. SoftBank shares fell 10.3% in Tokyo on Tuesday to \u00a55,387, their lowest since late March. The fall was the first reaction by shareholders to the deal because Monday was a public holiday in Japan. The Tokyo-based company\u2019s purchase of a controlling stake in wireless operator Sprint for \u00a317bn in 2013 left the company with big debts. It owed \u00a511.9tn (\u00a390bn) at the end of March, including \u00a54tn related to Sprint. It will use a \u00a51tn loan from Japan\u2019s Mizuho Bank for part of the ARM purchase. SoftBank\u2019s founder and chairman Masayoshi Son has pointed to almost \u00a52tn raised through asset sales in recent months but analysts had expected it to cut debt or buy back shares instead of embarking on another big deal. Neil Campling, head of technology and media research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said SoftBank made a bad job of explaining the deal and that its swoop on ARM looks opportunistic after just two weeks of talks. \u201cARM is an awesome asset we think and, if they execute and keep the culture as promised, in 10 years\u2019 time it may look to be a masterstroke. But short term is a different matter,\u201d he said. Campling said SoftBank may have opened the door to other bidders for ARM, whose chips appear in Apple iPhones and almost all smartphones as well as washing machines and other items that increasingly require processing power. The swiftness and stealth of SoftBank\u2019s move left investment bankers no time to pitch a takeover of ARM to companies such as Apple, Intel and Microsoft but US companies could enter the fray, he said. After jumping on news of the deal on Monday, ARM\u2019s shares fell 0.5% on Tuesday to \u00a316.67, suggesting shareholders do not yet expect a bidding war.",

So in a traditionally quiet period for the group - the three months to the end of June - overall revenues rose 1%. Within that UK revenues dipped 1% with parcel revenue up 2% and letter revenue down 3%, mitigated by the fact that political mailings were similar to the previous period thanks to the Brexit leaflets. Overall the company sounded a cautious note on the outlook: Trading the three months...was in line with our expectations, with no material change in overall trends. Movements in GDP are drivers for letter and business to business parcel volumes, and we are monitoring the situation. We remain focussed on operational and financial efficiency and delivering a high quality service for all our customers. Following the update, Royal Mail shares have added 1.5p to 503.5p in a falling market. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Despite EU referendum campaign mailings giving Royal Mail a boost, they delivered what we have come to expect; solid but uninspiring results, with perhaps a touch of glamour from double digit European growth. The UK business remains sluggish, without the benefit of the EU referendum the decline in letters volumes would be in line with company estimates , with competitive pressures in the UK parcels business showing no signs of easing. UK parcels was supposed to be the growth engine for Royal Mail, with the UK letters business in decline. So it is somewhat concerning that conditions in the UK parcel market look set to remain challenging. Royal Mail is in a much better position than other postal operators to weather the storm, we feel. It is by far the largest player, with around 50% of the UK parcel market, so can invest more in technology and service. There is plenty of scope to reduce costs, having spent so long in public hands. This should help to support profits, at a time when rivals are seeing margins squeezed. Cantor Fitzgerald was also positive, issuing a buy note on the business. Analyst Rob Byde said: Royal Mail has issued a cautious but in-line trading statement for the first quarter period. UK businesses are performing steadily but its European parcels activity continues to grow strongly. Our forecasts for the full year are unchanged with this update. The outlook for the UK economy in the short term is less certain but we think that Royal Mail is a good potential safe haven. Core UK parcels and letters operations are sensitive to the economy but Royal Mail\u2019s market position is strong. The group\u2019s parcels business is a lower cost offering and productivity in letters is improving significantly.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s brief flirtation with deflation has receded further into the past after dearer air fares, the rising cost of driving and more expensive computer games pushed up the cost of living last month. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.5% in the year ending in June, up from 0.3% in the year to May. With more price increases in the pipeline as a result of the Brexit vote and the rebound in commodity prices, analysts said inflation was on course to breach the official 2% target during 2017. However, they said they expected the Bank of England to ignore the rising cost of living and agree to fresh measures to stimulate growth at a meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee next month. The ONS said prices had risen by 0.2% between May and June this year, but remained unchanged over the same period in 2015. It collected a sample of the cost of about 700 goods and services before the EU referendum on 23 June. A breakdown of the CPI showed that air fares rose by 11%, the biggest increase between May and June on record, and the main factor behind the higher-than-expected inflation figure of 0.5%. Economists had been expecting 0.4%. The ONS statistician Phil Gooding said the cost of flights had possibly been raised by the Euro 2016 football championships in France, where Wales, Northern Ireland and England competed. There was a rise of more than 2p a litre in petrol and diesel, which meant a more rapid increase in the cost of transport. But cheaper furniture and accommodation helped blunt the hike, the ONS said. Inflation hovered around zero during 2015 as the collapse in oil prices cut the cost of travel and domestic fuel bills. In the first six months of 2016, however, it has been at 0.3% or 0.5%. Further increases will lead to a squeeze on living standards unless workers are able to secure more generous pay awards. So-called core inflation, which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, also rose last month, from an annual rate of 1.2% to 1.4%. The ONS producer price index provided supporting evidence that deflationary pressures are starting to ease for UK manufacturers. Although the price of goods leaving factory gates in June was 0.4% below that of a year earlier, the decrease last month was smaller than the 0.6% annual decline in the 12 months to May. Meanwhile, the cost of fuel and raw materials bought by industry was down by 0.5% in the year to June, following a 4.4% decline the previous month. Victoria Clarke, an analyst at Investec, said she expected inflation to be at 3% by the middle of 2017, but then fall back as a result of weaker demand caused by the fallout from Brexit. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cUK inflation rose in June, buoyed by rising airfares and higher oil prices. Inflation had been stuck at 0.3% for most of the year to date prior to June, but the latest increase was one of the largest seen since late 2014, and likely to be the start of a rising trend in prices as costs march higher in response to the recent slump in sterling.\u201d",

As UK inflation came in higher than expected, giving a lift to the pound, the FTSE 100 has slipped 24.18 points to 6671.24. But Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling is heading the risers, up 36p to \u00a315.57 as analysts at JP Morgan raised their recommendation from neutral to overweight and their price target from \u00a315 to \u00a318. The bank said Coca-Cola was well placed in a low inflation world, with the soft drinks market likely to be resilient to economic volatility. It expected Coca-Cola to have strengthened its balance sheet within a year, leaving it free to return cash to shareholders or take part in merger and acquisition activity. Sky has also been boosted by a broker upgrade, 16.5p better at 896.5p as RBC lifted its target from \u00a310 to \u00a311 and moving from underperform to outperform. The bank said: Our view reflects (1) the lower share price; (2) de-risking of rights renewal in Germany; (3) upside from mobile rollout. The rise in price target is partly driven by our forecasts for higher outer year earnings in pound terms from Germany and Italy.

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: The FTSE\u2019s mining contingent is on the back foot this morning, holding the UK blue-chip index back after Rio\u2019s second quarter production report delivered iron-ore shipments below analyst expectations, albeit still higher than both the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015. Management has been fortunate to be able to reiterate 2016 production guidance thanks to limited weather impact, operational efficiencies and ramp-ups/roll-outs, however, its pledges of compelling and consistent returns are falling on deaf ears. This is because investors are focusing on a strong US dollar hindering a the commodity space recovery as the US Fed looks to hike rates and peers look to do quite the opposite. Low/negative interest rates and the prospect of more monetary and fiscal stimulus from major central banks (Oz and NZ on top of BoE, ECB, BoJ) suggests flagging faith in a growth revival to counter a slowing China and a potential race to the bottom generating another round of currency wars that simply serves to send the dollar even higher.

      "bodyText": "BT is failing to invest properly in broadband infrastructure and should be broken up unless it spends more money to improve the service, according to a committee of MPs. In a report published on Tuesday, the culture, media and sport select committee said BT\u2019s underinvestment in its Openreach broadband infrastructure division could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The MPs said BT should spend more and give Openreach more freedom over how it uses the money. They based their demands on an independent report, published alongside the committee\u2019s document. BT has faced criticism from the regulator, Ofcom, and rival companies that use its broadband network over a lack of investment in high-quality cables and delays in fixing faults. Openreach is obliged to make its cables and services available to BT\u2019s competitors on the same terms. In February, Ofcom stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to spin off Openreach, as requested by competitors including TalkTalk and Sky. Instead, the regulator told BT to open up its infrastructure and threatened the company with big fines if the service did not improve. The committee said Ofcom had not pushed BT enough in the past to improve Openreach\u2019s service. BT has deliberately spent money on high-risk activities with potential high returns, including Premier League and Champions League TV rights, while keeping investment in Openreach flat and maintaining poor service levels, the MPs said. \u201cShould BT fail to offer the reforms and investment assurances necessary to satisfy Ofcom\u2019s and our own concerns, then the regulator will need to set in train the steps to enforce full separation of the Openreach business,\u201d they said. Dido Harding, the chief executive of TalkTalk, said the MPs\u2019 report was significant because it had cross-party support and chimed with the government\u2019s demand that companies should operate for the wider good. \u201cThe government is saying we need to work out how to run the country for everyone and the select committee is saying one of our biggest companies isn\u2019t doing that. The report is very critical of BT, but it\u2019s also quietly critical of Ofcom for being slow to tackle these issues,\u201d the Conservative peer said. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t stiffen Ofcom to [deal with] BT and Openreach I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d BT said it was in talks with Ofcom about giving Openreach more autonomy and it hoped to reach a deal that would satisfy the committee. It said the service needed to improve and that it was spending money to make this happen. \u201cWe are disappointed to be criticised for having invested more than \u00a31bn a year in infrastructure when the UK was emerging from recession and rival companies invested little,\u201d the company said. \u201cToday\u2019s report is in any case largely historic. We are already pumping in hundreds of millions of pounds of extra money and we have also committed to invest a further \u00a36bn over the next three years.\u201d The former state monopoly announced \u00a36bn of spending to improve its broadband infrastructure operation in May, including laying faster cables and pledging to halve the number of missed appointments at Openreach. But rivals such as Sky criticised the company for responding only when threatened with being broken up.",

It said the service needed to improve and that it was spending money to make this happen.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed to be criticised for having invested more than \u00a31bn a year in infrastructure when the UK was emerging from recession and rival companies invested little,\u201d the company said. <br></p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s report is in any case largely historic. We are already pumping in hundreds of millions of pounds of extra money and we have also committed to invest a further \u00a36bn over the next three years.\u201d</p> <p>The former state monopoly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/bt-roll-out-superfast-broadband-4g-6bn-investment\">announced \u00a36bn of spending</a> to improve its broadband infrastructure operation in May, including laying faster cables and pledging to halve the number of missed appointments at Openreach. But rivals such as Sky criticised the company for responding only when threatened with being broken up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Surging electricity prices in South Australia have sparked calls for a national inquiry into renewable energy and whether the electricity market is coping with the influx of wind and solar. Over the past month South Australia has had surges in wholesale electricity prices. Normally sitting below $100 per megawatt hour, they have fluctuated dramatically in recent weeks, hitting as much as $14,000 per megawatt hour and regularly jumping above $10,000. The prices have spooked energy-intensive heavy industry in the state, including the embattled Arrium steelworks, and led the premier, Jay Weatherill, to call on a recently mothballed gas power plant to fire up. South Australia leads the Australian states and territories when it comes to reliance on renewable energy sources besides large-scale hydro. About 40% of its electricity comes from variable renewable sources such as wind and it has a 50% renewable energy target for 2025. In response to the price surges, the South Australian senator Nick Xenophon told the Australian Financial Review he would suggest a Senate inquiry examine the mix of renewable energy in Australia. \u201cI am not anti-wind but there are legitimate questions to ask about the renewable energy mix and the role of interconnections and the like,\u201d he said. The Northern Territory chief minister, Adam Giles, called for a \u201cnational energy summit\u201d to look at the state\u2019s \u201cover-reliance on renewables\u201d. \u201cThe nation can\u2019t afford to see heavy industry shut down because of crippling power prices and uncertainty over supply,\u201d he said. But the problem wasn\u2019t the state\u2019s reliance on renewable energy, said South Australia\u2019s treasurer and minister for energy, Tom Koutsantonis. Instead, he said South Australia was being penalised by the National Electricity Market for its success in attracting renewable energy to the state. \u201cThe National Energy Market has passed its use by date \u2013 it has failed to keep up with environmental policies and advances in technology,\u201d he told the Guardian. Koutsantonis said said one problem was a trade imbalance since, while South Australia only had an electricity connection to Victoria, Victoria had a connection with three states. \u201cA truly national energy market with greater interconnection would allow this clean renewable energy to be sold into other states, and would help meet the renewables targets of those states.\u201d Koutsantonis welcomed the newly combined federal portfolios of energy and environment, and called for an urgent Coag meeting. \u201cThese portfolios areas are inextricably linked, but federal environmental policy has for too long been at odds with national energy policy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that Mr Frydenberg has been appointed we need to convene an urgent meeting of Coag so we can get to work on reforming the national energy market.\u201d Hugh Saddler from the infrastructure consultancy Pitt and Sherry agreed that the National Electricity Market needed to be reformed. He said there were short-term problems causing the recent price spikes in South Australia. They were mostly the cold weather there and maintenance on one of the two interconnectors to Victoria. A high gas price was also partly to blame. But he said the underlying problem was an outdated National Electricity Market. He said it needed to be reformed to cope with variable sources of electricity and a Senate inquiry or a national summit could be a way of starting that process. \u201cIt was designed in the 1990s when the assumption was the energy supply would mostly be coal,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a system with a large penetration of renewables \u2013 which is the case in South Australia\u2013 you need a completely different system.\u201d Saddler said there were lots of possibilities for redesigning the wholesale energy is traded, which could keep electricity prices down. \u201cWe need to have a debate about [those options].\u201d Among the aspects that could be changed were the \u201cgross pool market\u201d where all wholesalers are forced to sell all of their energy on an open market. That meant prices dropped very low when there was a lot of wind or solar being produced but non-renewable wholesalers could then push prices higher to recoup costs when less wind or solar was available. He said creating more connections between states, like connecting South Australia with New South Wales, could also help smooth out the market. \u201cWe need some sort of process \u2013 a Senate inquiry might be a good way to kick it off, provided it\u2019s not just a question about renewables but about the overall structure and the operation of the National Electricity Market, with a high penetration of variable renewable electricity supply,\u201d Saddler said.",
