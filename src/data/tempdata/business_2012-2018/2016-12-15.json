      "bodyText": "London\u2019s economic output per person is more than double the average across the rest of the UK, according to new figures that underscore the challenge facing ministers as they vow to tackle the UK\u2019s entrenched regional inequality. Official figures showed gross value added (GVA) per head \u2013 a measure of what is generated by economic activity in an area \u2013 was higher in London than any other region in 2015 at \u00a343,629. That dwarfed the figure for the lowest region, Wales, at \u00a318,002 and was also doublethe level of \u00a321,638 for the UK without London. The figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed the gap between the capital and the rest of the UK had grown over the last decade. Responding to the latest sign of regional imbalances in the UK, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called on the government to urgently step in with support, including investment in infrastructure projects like housebuilding, rail improvements, roads and clean energy. \u201cPeople in every part of Britain need a strong local economy, generating good jobs and improving living standards. But there is a huge gap between London and other parts of the UK,\u201d said TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cFor decades now, successive governments have failed to invest enough outside of the capital. We urgently need a proper industrial strategy that reaches every community. With Brexit on the horizon, it\u2019s all the more important that we speed ahead with the investment needed to give every part of Britain decent jobs and strong industry.\u201d O\u2019Grady said help \u201cmust be targeted at communities that have been abandoned after the loss of traditional industries, and where too many jobs are insecure and low paid\u201d. The Resolution Foundation thinktank, which earlier this week highlighted links between regional imbalances and support for Brexit in June\u2019s referendum, said the latest data highlighted the challenge facing Britain\u2019s new metro mayors due to be elected in some areas next year under devolution plans. It noted that all cities bar London were still worse off than they were before the financial crisis, based on the GVA figures. The thinktank\u2019s analysis showed London was on average \u00a31,270 better off, the rest of the UK city regions were \u00a3900 worse off and the country as a whole was \u00a3450 worse off. Cardiff and Belfast were furthest from their pre-crisis GVA levels. But the thinktank also saw some reasons to be hopeful that the gap with London would narrow in some places, as the 2015 figures showed big cities enjoyed relatively strong growth in economic output last year, particularly in the North West. Analysing big city regions, Resolution said the Liverpool city region was the top performer in terms of growth in GVA per head last year, with a rise of 3% \u2013 almost double London\u2019s growth of 1.6%. \u201cThis strong growth provides a good building block for their new city mayors to build on next year,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \u201c Closing the economic output gap between the capital and Britain\u2019s other major cities will play a central role in delivering economic growth throughout the UK over the next decade.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIf there is one issue I regard as crucial to successful investment, it is the need for a long-term approach.\u201d So said Martin Gilbert a year ago in a blistering blogpost for Aberdeen Asset Management, the fund management firm where he is chief executive. Short-termism, he continued, is difficult to uproot because it is driven by greed, fear and the desire for instant gratification. But Gilbert was clear on why \u201cthe early exit culture infecting today\u2019s market\u201d should be resisted: by focusing on quality, long-termism leads to better outcomes. Great stuff, and an accurate summary of why the cut-and-run approach to managing money damages prosperity. But here comes Gilbert, wearing his other hat of deputy chairman of Sky, endorsing the idea that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a310.75-a-share bid for the company is somehow fair. An offer at a 40% premium to last week\u2019s share price \u201cwill accelerate and de-risk the delivery of future value for all Sky shareholders,\u201d he says. Well, yes, guaranteed cash is on offer. But, come on, a mechanical takeover premium \u2013 calculated from a low point for the share price \u2013 is a grossly superficial way to view matters. Sky\u2019s shares were trading at \u00a311 as recently as April and little has happened since then to alter the company\u2019s fundamental prospects. Management gave a confident presentation in October that could almost have been designed to tell investors to ignore the wobbly share price and think of the longer-term rewards from kick-starting the Italian and German operations and getting into mobile telephony. Not everybody was convinced, of course, otherwise the shares would not have fallen to 769p. But listen to Polo Tang, respected media analyst at UBS: Sky stands at an inflection point after a period of heavy investment in broadband and high-definition TV. Earnings per share should improve from 62.6p last year to more than 100p by 2020. His target for Sky, as a standalone business, is \u00a313.70, some 27% above the value of the offer from 21st Century Fox. One shouldn\u2019t be too damning of Gilbert. His powers of negotiation are curtailed by the hard fact of Fox\u2019s ownership of 39% of Sky. The Murdochs could have chosen to be nastier: they could have made a hostile offer at a mere 20% premium and still have hoped to crawl to a position of majority ownership. Gilbert and the independent directors, by holding out for a 40% premium and ensuring that 75% of outside shareholders must approve the deal, have at least overcome that danger. But there is no reason for long-term investors to be cowed or even grateful. Instead they should remember Gilbert\u2019s day-job advice about the perils of instant gratification and the need to look at the horizon. There is a simple calculation here: if UBS\u2019s analysis is even vaguely correct, the sensible response is to reject the offer and wait for greater value to emerge from Sky over time. The company has rarely disappointed its owners for long. Just say no to the Murdochs\u2019 opportunistic bid. Outside fund managers coming to the Alliance Trust A revolution is happening in Dundee. Grand old investment business Alliance Trust plans to sell its in-house manager and appoint eight outside fund managers instead, to be overseen by investment consultants Willis Towers Watson. In truth, the revolution has been happening in stages since activist investor corporation Elliott climbed onboard in 2010. The New York hedge fund argued the incumbent directors were enjoying a comfortable and well-paid existence while not obviously doing a terrific job for investors. Its views found a sympathetic audience. A boardroom shakeup followed last year, famed chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox departed, and now comes the plan to bring in outside managers. There is nothing wrong with a mainstream \u201cexternalisation\u201d approach, certainly for a trust with \u00a33.6bn of assets. Yet Alliance Trust investors tend to be a conservative bunch. Here they are being asked to approve a plan that, in effect, starts from scratch. What\u2019s the dividend policy? Who are the managers? And, if the plan is to beat a global index by 2%, what\u2019s the investment strategy to make it happen? Answers will follow in time, says Alliance. They had better, because saying you\u2019ll find \u201cbest in class\u201d managers is just a statement of good intentions until the track records are put on display. One of the few solid facts, as investors will note, is that costs will increase from 45 basis points to 60. More details are needed \u2013 and quickly.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "World Bank raises record $75bn to help poorest members", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Bank has pledged to step up the fight against extreme poverty after announcing that tough negotiations with rich countries have left it with a record $75bn (\u00a360bn) for grants and soft loans to its poorest members over the next three years. Despite budgetary pressures caused by slow growth and austerity, the Washington-based institution said 47 countries had agreed to make donations to the International Development Association \u2013 its fund for providing assistance to the least-developed nations. The bank said that for the first time in IDA\u2019s 56-year history it would be using its strong credit rating to raise money for the fund from the world\u2019s capital markets. A third of the $75bn will be raised in this way, with a third contributed by donor governments and a third coming from the bank\u2019s own resources. The last IDA round raised just under $52bn. \u201cThis is a pivotal step in the movement to end extreme poverty,\u201d the World Bank Group president, Jim Yong Kim, said. \u201cThe commitments made by our partners, combined with IDA\u2019s innovations to crowd in the private sector and raise funds from capital markets, will transform the development trajectory of the world\u2019s poorest countries. We are grateful for our partners\u2019 trust in IDA\u2019s ability to deliver results.\u201d IDA was set up in 1960 and runs on three-year replenishment cycles. The new round \u2013 IDA18 \u2013 will run from 2017 to 2020 and is intended to support health and nutrition for 400 million people, access to water for 45 million people, training for 9-10 million teachers and immunisations for 130-180 million children. The bank will not reveal details of the contributions made by individual countries until the new year. Britain was the biggest single donor to the last round of funding (IDA17), followed by the US. The Department for International Development will maintain funding for IDA at its previous sterling level but, at a time when government aid spending has come under attack, will insist on reforms at the bank to ensure the money is well spent. The development secretary, Priti Patel, has made it clear to Kim that he should be able to explain why, where and how the bank is spending UK taxpayers\u2019 money. Kyle Peters, the World Bank Group\u2019s interim managing director and co-chair of the IDA18 negotiations, said: \u201cWith this innovative package, the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2013 especially the most fragile and vulnerable \u2013 will get the support they need to grow, create opportunities for people, and make themselves more resilient to shocks and crises. \u201cIDA\u2019s focus on issues like climate change, gender equality and preventing conflict and violence will also contribute to greater stability and progress around the world.\u201d Peters added that the commitment was a \u201cdecisive and inspiring\u201d response to the challenge of achieving the ambitious sustainable development goals for poverty reduction adopted by the international community in 2015. The bank said it had asked donor countries to match the contributions in national currencies that they made to IDA17 and that in the vast majority of cases the call had been heeded. Kim believes the extra money will help achieve the two key goals he has set for the bank: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 and raising the living standards of the bottom 40% of the population in developing countries. The bank says IDA will be able to double the resources to address fragility, conflict and violence as well as additional financing for refugees and countries that host them. Some of the extra funding will be channelled through the bank\u2019s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, a decision that drew criticism from the development charity Oxfam. Nick Galasso, head of Oxfam\u2019s World Bank office, said: \u201cThis is great and sorely needed news, when the world faces the crises of inequality and climate change. \u201cThe World Bank is also proposing to dramatically increase the money it gives via the private sector, which would be a bad idea. The bank has a very poor track record in this area, bankrolling corporations that make active use of tax havens and others that have been involved in murderous land grabs. We urge the bank to significantly increase their oversight and protections before a single dollar is invested in this way.\u201d Jamie Drummond, executive director for global strategy at the One Campaign, said: \u201cWe expect more than half of the $75bn committed during this replenishment to flow to Africa over the next three years. Such robust backing for the bank is a real boon for the fight against extreme poverty, hunger, deadly diseases, and the other root causes of forced displacement.

A third of the $75bn will be raised in this way, with a third contributed by donor governments and a third coming from the bank\u2019s own resources. The last IDA round raised just under $52bn.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a pivotal step in the movement to end extreme poverty,\u201d the World Bank Group president, Jim Yong Kim, said.<strong> </strong>\u201cThe commitments made by our partners, combined with IDA\u2019s innovations to crowd in the private sector and raise funds from capital markets, will transform the development trajectory of the world\u2019s poorest countries. We are grateful for our partners\u2019 trust in IDA\u2019s ability to deliver results.\u201d<br></p> <p>IDA was set up in 1960 and runs on three-year replenishment cycles. The new round \u2013 IDA18 \u2013 will run from 2017 to 2020 and is intended to support health and nutrition for 400 million people, access to water for 45 million people, training for 9-10 million teachers and immunisations for 130-180 million children.</p> <p>The bank will not reveal details of the contributions made by individual countries until the new year. Britain was the <a href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2014/01/ida-17-record-size-real-terms/\">biggest single donor</a> to the last round of funding (IDA17), followed by the US.</p> <p>The Department for International Development will maintain funding for IDA at its previous sterling level but, at a time when government aid spending has come under attack, will insist on reforms at the bank to ensure the money is well spent. The development secretary, Priti Patel, has made it clear to Kim that he should be able to explain why, where and how the bank is spending UK taxpayers\u2019 money.</p> <p>Kyle Peters, the World Bank Group\u2019s interim managing director and co-chair of the IDA18 negotiations, said: <em> </em>\u201cWith this innovative package, the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2013 especially the most fragile and vulnerable \u2013 will get the support they need to grow, create opportunities for people, and make themselves more resilient to shocks and crises.<em> </em></p> <p>\u201cIDA\u2019s focus on issues like climate change, gender equality and preventing conflict and violence will also contribute to greater stability and progress around the world.\u201d<em><br></em></p> <p>Peters added that the commitment was a \u201cdecisive and inspiring\u201d response to the challenge of achieving the ambitious sustainable development goals for poverty reduction adopted by the international community in 2015.</p> <p> The bank said it had asked donor countries to match the contributions in national currencies that they made to IDA17 and that in the vast majority of cases the call had been heeded.</p> <p>Kim believes the extra money will help achieve the two key goals he has set for the bank: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 and raising the living standards of the bottom 40% of the population in developing countries. The bank says IDA will be able to double the resources to address fragility, conflict and violence as well as additional financing for refugees and countries that host them. </p> <p>Some of the extra funding will be channelled through the bank\u2019s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, a decision that drew criticism from the development charity <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/\">Oxfam</a>. Nick Galasso, head of Oxfam\u2019s World Bank office, said: \u201cThis is great and sorely needed news, when the world faces the crises of inequality and climate change.</p> <p>\u201cThe World Bank is also proposing to dramatically increase the money it gives via the private sector, which would be a bad idea.

      "bodyText": "The vote in the Greek parliament saw some unlikely allies back the government\u2019s Christmas bonus to pensioners, with the final figure in favour 196. Our correspondent Helena Smith says: The 61 were New Democracy which effectively abstained. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Greek parliament approves pension deal With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the first time in a year and talking of three more increases to come next year, the dollar has strengthened and helped push banking shares higher, supporting European markets in general. Simon Gergel, chief investment officer of UK equities at Allianz told Reuters: Rising interest rates are generally quite good for banks, depending on their specific situation, but in general they are sitting on large deposit bases and they can make a bigger spread as interest rates go up. The market gains came despite a fall in commodity stocks after the greenback moved higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 49.82 points or 0.72% higher at 6999.01, tantalising close to the 7000 level Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.08% to 11,366.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.05% at 4819.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 2.09% to 18,994.79 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.33% at 9340.8 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.88% to 613.76 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently In Athens the vote on the controversial legislation has just begun as thousands of pensioners take to the streets in Athens. With the support of three political parties and the ruling two-party coalition the ballot is easily expected to secure sought support to be passed into law. That means pensioners will receive a 13th payment before Christmas. Helena Smith reports: Pensioners, representing organizations across the country, have gathered en masse in central Athens, in a protest rally now headed towards the prime minister\u2019s office. The demonstration could not be better timed, coinciding with the vote and the spotlight the Greek PM, Alexis Tsipras, has inadvertently placed on pensioners with the announcement of his surprise pre-Christmas bonus. Holding banners decrying the loss of benefits many have suffered since the crisis began, they demanded that the cuts be reinstated. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget what we gave to the social security system, we are not going to give up what is rightly ours, we are not going to sell our dignity,\u201d the organisations said in a statement. Pensioners, some living on as little as \u20ac300 a month, are among those who have been hardest hit by the harsh fiscal policies debt-stricken Greece has been forced to apply in return for international rescue funds. While Tsipras\u2019 unexpected gift has been welcomed most do not feel it goes far enough. \u201cThey have to give us back our full pensions, which represent all the years that we worked, all the contributions that we made, not make a mockery of us with crumbs and bonuses,\u201d said Dimos Koubouris, who heads the federation of pensioners. The Greek parliament is due to start voting shortly on the government\u2019s plan to pay one-off Christmas bonuses to pensioners, the move which annoyed the country\u2019s creditors so much they put debt relief on hold. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is at the European summit in Brussels: As markets move higher, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Despite a woeful performance from the mining sector and falling oil prices, the FTSE 100 is ending the day firmly in positive territory. Clearly the number of stocks expected to benefit from rising US rates outpaces those who will suffer from lower commodity prices. Investors are spending their first 24 hours in a new world, one dominated by rising US interest rates plus an impending fiscal stimulus that is meant to rescue the US from economic malaise. With the euro in full flight it is not surprising to see eurozone markets racing, and this is probably something we should get used to for the year ahead. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100\u2019s performance will depend on whether the rising dollar does too much to torpedo the commodity rally, or whether higher rates will lift bank stocks sufficiently in the year ahead to offset this. 15 December 2016 may well prove to be a microcosm of what 2017 has to offer. Back with the US and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to climb following the Fed rate decision. It is now up around 154 points at 19,946 and heading towards 20,000. And Moscovici has also met the head of Greece\u2019s opposition party New Democracy: Back with Greece and European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has tweeted: The FTSE 100 has regained the 7000 level for the first time since the end of October. Bank shares are among the leading risers after the US rate hike from the Federal Reserve, and hopes that Italian banks will be recapitalised. Earlier there were some new US economic figures, all fairly positive in the wake of the Fed\u2019s interest rate rise and plans for another three increases next year. The consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire manufacturing index came in at 9 in December, well above the consensus of 4 and the November figure of 1.5. Jobless claims fell for the second week in a row, down 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000. This is the 93rd straight week that claims have been below 300,000, which is a level associated with a healthy jobs market. Meanwhile the US current account deficit fell from $118.3bn in the second quarter to $113bn in the latest three months. A jump in soybean shipments boosted exports, according to the commerce department. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up around 120 points or 0.6%. Tsakalotos has defended Athens\u2019 plans to pay out one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas. A day after eurozone lenders put short-term debt relief for Greece on hold in response, he told Reuters in Berlin: I don\u2019t think this is a big issue. We have bigger fish to fry. Tsakalotos also argued that Europe needed to show it could solve its own problems in order to restore confidence among working-class people after populist gains in a series of European elections, the Brexit vote and the Italian referendum. On Wall Street, the Dow has opened higher, after losing more than 100 points yesterday following the Fed rate hike. Dow Jones up 46 points, or 0.2% to 19,837.04 Nasdaq up 2.45 points at 4923.66 S&amp;P 500 up 1.96 points to 2255.24 His comments came as French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande jumped to Greece\u2019s defence of Greece after European creditors pulled a recently announced debt relief package for the country. Hollande said ahead of today\u2019s summit of EU leaders that it is out of the question to ask for further additional efforts from Greece or prevent them from taking a number of sovereign measures that respect the commitments\u201d that Greece previously took. Just days after a eurozone agreement to approve some debt relief, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras surprised eurozone creditors by announcing a Christmas bonus for some 1.6 million low-income pensioners and committing to restore a lower sales tax rate for Aegean Sea islanders. Tsipras said at the summit there\u2019s room for \u201ca breakthrough, without blackmail.\u201d Greek bond yields are surging, with ten-year yields hitting a one-month high of 7.61%, up 25 basis points. Short-dated yields spiked to a four-month high ahead of a parliamentary vote on a bonus to poor pensioners that threatens to derail the country\u2019s debt relief plans. Two-year bond yields soared more than 150bps to 8.65%, the highest since August, and five-year yields jumped 16 bps to 8.34%. The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said the Greek government must be credible with its creditors, but also with the people of Greece. He insisted that the euro group had not taken any decision on debt relief for Greece yet, according to Reuters. Back in the markets, the euro has slipped below $1.04 for the first time in 14 years. Naeem Hamed of Think Markets blames the widening gap between monetary policy on the opposite sides of the Atlantic. The Fed over in the US is tightening their belt and the ECB is still no way close to taper its monetary policy. Traders have gone aggressive today and the divergence in monetary policies is the major focal point for them. Worth noting that the euro is doing less badly against a basket of other currencies: Newsflash: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its \u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of Sky. If the deal goes through, it will create the most powerful media group in the UK. My colleague Mark Sweney explains what happens next: Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than \u00a318bn, which will give him control of pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany and Italy; in addition to ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and radio group TalkSport. Fox has not raised the initial \u00a310.75 per share offer it tabled on Friday. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide whether the deal raises public interest concerns, specifically relating to media plurality. Here\u2019s the full story: City experts have rapidly digested today\u2019s news from the Bank of England, so here\u2019s the best early reaction: Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, predicts that the Bank of England will leaves rates unchanged for some time: \u201cThe Bank of England was not expected to change policy at this meeting, and their statement suggests that the balance of arguments favours keeping policy unchanged for the foreseeable future. They note that the forward-looking components of business surveys are weaker than those for current output levels, suggesting a slowdown in 2017. Also, with trade weighted sterling moving higher since their last meeting, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than they had envisaged. \u201cThe MPC will remain sensitive to any slowdown in economic activity next year, with real income growth squeezed by rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty impacting corporate investment plans. In my view, the balance of probability still favours another small rate reduction next year, and with the Fed hiking rates, this will continue to put downward pressure on sterling against the dollar.\u201d But Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes inflationary pressure will force interest rates up next year: \u201cWith inflation moving towards the Bank\u2019s 2% target quicker than expected, the only way is up for interest rates in 2017. Base rate hikes will be the tool of choice for the monetary policy committee to keep prices in check. Mortgage holders should consult their advisers now about fixing their rates before they rise\u201d Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says the Bank is keeping a close eye on inflation and wage growth: In August, by cutting the bank rate and expanding its asset purchases the BoE helped avoid a crisis immediately after the Brexit vote. The good news is that the work is over for now. The UK economy requires no further support from monetary policy. The economy has outperformed expectations since the referendum. And while growth is set to slow next year the risk of recession looks low. The BoE\u2019s GDP growth outlook of 1.4% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018 is broadly in line with our own call of 1.5% growth in each year. The final minutes of the year indicate that the MPC is in a neutral gear for now. The committee continues to pay close attention to the Brexit-related downside risks to growth, especially the squeeze on real incomes coming from the anticipated rise in inflation from the sharp sterling depreciation. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen reports: The Bank of England has left interest rates at their record low of 0.25% but repeated a warning that higher inflation and slower wage growth risk squeezing household budgets and spending next year. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep rates on hold and maintain the current programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. Policymakers had cut rates and expanded QE back in August to shore up confidence in the wake of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. In minutes to its final meeting of the year, the MPC said it would continue to trade off the effects of a weaker pound raising inflation against the prospects of economic growth and employment slowing. For now, policymakers said they saw no need to change policy as little had appeared to change since the MPC published its forecasts for the economy in November\u2019s inflation report. \u201cA slowdown in growth remained likely, but there had been little news since the time of the November inflation report about domestic activity and, although the near-term global outlook had improved, this was counterbalanced by more elevated risks,\u201d the minutes said... Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full story: The pound has fallen sharply against the US dollar, as investors digest today\u2019s Bank of England decision. Today\u2019s minutes show that the Bank has revised its inflation forecasts down a little, due to the recent recovery in sterling. So that means there\u2019s less chance that interest rates might be hiked. The MPC says: \u201cSince the Committee\u2019s previous meeting, sterling\u2019s trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated by over 6%, while dollar oil prices have risen by 14%. All else equal, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than envisaged in the November inflation report, though it is still likely to overshoot the target later in 2017 and through 2018.\u201d And that\u2019s enough to knock almost one cent off the pound today, to $1.2478. The Bank of England believes that the global economy could benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to boost government spending. The MPC says: \u201cSince November, long-term interest rates have risen internationally, including in the United Kingdom. In part, this reflects expectations of looser fiscal policy in the United States which, if it materialises, will help to underpin the slightly greater momentum in the global economy evident in a range of data since the summer.\u201d The minutes of this month\u2019s Bank of England meeting show that the central bank sees no need to change monetary policy, as little has changed since November\u2019s inflation report. The monetary policy committee says: \u201cA slowdown in growth remained likely, but there had been little news since the time of the November inflation report about domestic activity and, although the near-term global outlook had improved, this was counterbalanced by more elevated risks.\u201d The minutes also highlighted a \u201cnotable decline in consumer confidence\u201d, repeated a forecast for unemployment to rise next year and for inflation to overtake pay growth \u201cmarginally\u201d in 2017. The Bank reiterates its previous stance that is was ready to make monetary policy tighter or looser depending on how the economy evolves as the Brexit process gets underway. \u201cMonetary policy could respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfolded to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\u201d The BoE has also voted to leave its quantitative easing programme, created to stimulate the UK economy, unchanged at today\u2019s meeting. That means it will still buy and hold \u00a3435bn of UK sovereign debt, and \u00a310bn of corporate debt too. And all three decisions were unanimous. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%. More to follow Here we go! The Bank of England\u2019s critics claim it blundered this summer by slashing interest rates to 0.25% and restarting its quantitative easing plan. They point to the decent economic data since the Brexit vote, as evidence that the BoE over-reacted. But some City experts believe things would be rather worse if the BoE hasn\u2019t moved swiftly. Ralf Preusser, global head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Bloomberg TV this morning that the Bank had provided valuable leadership immediately after the EU referendum. The Bank\u2019s \u201cincredibly reactive\u201d approach, and the unexpectedly rapid leadership race to succeed David Cameron, protected the economy. And that\u2019s why the confidence shock which had been expected \u201cdid not materialise\u201d, says Preusser, adding that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t criticised the Bank for \u2018jumping the gun\u2019\u201d, as some do. It\u2019s time for our regular update from Reuters\u2019 source in the Italian government: Note the \u2018if necessary\u2019 -- Italy\u2019s government is still hoping to persuade private investors to provide funds to recapitalise lenders such as Monte dei Paschi. Just 25 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. With everyone expecting No Change, the real news will probably be in the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says there are three things to watch out for: Inflation: price pressure is building, could the larger than forecast increase in prices in November worry the Bank, especially if this pace of increase continues? Any clarification on just how tolerant the Bank will be of an inflation over-shoot. Could the Bank balance any hawkish concern about inflation, with concern about the impact of Brexit and the triggering of Article 50. OUCH! The euro just slumped to a new near 14-year low against the rampant US dollar. Speaking of Greece, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has hit back at the International Monetary Fund over its warning that Athens hasn\u2019t tackled its tax and pension problems. Writing in the Financial Times, Moscovici said Greece had made \u201cunprecedented efforts\u201d including \u201cmajor reforms of the pension, personal income tax and VAT systems\u201d. Is the commission being too lenient on Greece in contrast with an ostensibly more realistic IMF position? Of course not! While it has worked tirelessly to help Greece build a sustainable recovery, it has also pressed the authorities there to respect their commitments. The commission has been an honest broker, representing the interests of the eurozone as a whole. The next step is to conclude the second programme review, which hinges on an agreement to bring the IMF on board. This cannot happen as long as positions are defined by dogma or short-term political tactics with no regard for the social effect of the measures proposed. More here: Greece cannot be condemned to austerity for ever No response from the IMF, yet anyway. But former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis decided to attack Moscovici on Twitter, earning a rebuke from the commissioner\u2019s press officer. All terribly edifying. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras seems to have found support from the majority of political parties who will be backing his drive to hand out pre-Christmas fiscal gifts in a roll-call vote later today. MPs are being urged to back Tsipras, even though the giveaways have alarmed Greece\u2019s creditors - prompting them to freeze short-term debt relief plans yesterday. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Passions are flaring ahead of today\u2019s vote with senior cadres in the Syriza party calling it one of the most crucial ballots since the leftists assumed power. Addressing the 300-member House this morning, the Interior Minister Panos Skourletis emphasised the significance of the moment. \u201cThis is not a chance moment but a moment where parliament should affirm the right of the government of the country to do the self-evident. The agreement [with lenders] foresees it and the numbers prove it. I don\u2019t understand why we should wait. Citizens\u2019 needs, pensioners\u2019 needs have a priority over the needs of Brussels.\u201d Ahead of the ballot political parties, including the far right Golden Dawn, are signalling they will endorse the embattled prime minister\u2019s spending spree. The KKE communist party and social democrat Pasok party also said they would support Alexis Tsipras\u2019 decision to, in effect, grant retirees a 13th pension in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus. The main opposition centre right New Democracy party said it would not support the legislation and instead vote \u201cpresent.\u201d Speaking in Brussels, its leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis declared that the leftist-led administration was \u201cgambling\u201d with the debt-stricken country\u2019s future. Tsipras, he said, \u201chas once more proved himself to be immoral and dangerous.\u201d Greek journalist Eleni Varvitsiotis has heard that creditors are about to go public with their concerns: Gold has hit its lowest level since February this morning, down 1% to just $1.134 per ounce. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar has rallied (so you need fewer dollars to buy the same amount of gold). But gold is also less attractive in an environment of higher inflation and interest rates, as it doesn\u2019t yield anything. Shares in two precious metals producers, Randgold and Fresnillo (the silver producer) are leading the fallers on the stock market: JD Sports has become the latest retailer to face serious criticism over working practices, a year after its rival Sports Direct found itself in very hot water for paying staff less than the legal minimum. An investigation by Channel 4 found evidence of staff at its Rochdale warehouse being badly treated, including a \u201c3 strikes and you\u2019re sacked\u201c policy, staff being threatened with dismissal for sitting down, and airport-style security checks and random searches. Shares in JD Sports fell 7% yesterday as the news broke. And today, the company told the City it was opening an investigation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says politicians need to do more to protect workers: \u201cThese are degrading conditions to work in. The practices exposed at JD Sports show just how little value some companies attach to their staff. \u201cJD Sports\u2019 initial response \u2013 denying the problems \u2013 doesn\u2019t instil confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that Sports Direct wasn\u2019t just one bad apple, and that terrible working practices are taking place across the UK. \u201cThe government needs to look seriously at how this sort of behaviour continues to take place in today\u2019s Britain. \u201cUnions in workplaces can stamp out this sort of abuse. I would encourage anyone working in a warehouse like this to join a union and ensure that management cannot ignore their voice.\u201d French fund manager Etienne de Marsac has tweeted a handy graph, showing how UK and US government borrowing costs have jumped, thanks to the Fed (as flagged earlier). Newsflash: UK retail sales are still growing , despite the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Retail sales volumes grew by 0.2% in November, and were 5.9% higher than a year earlier. That\u2019s down from 1.8% monthly growth in October. Non-food sales were particularly strong; perhaps due to shoppers snapping up offers on Black Friday. But there are also signs that the recent rises in petrol prices have forced some drivers to cut back. The Office for National Statistics says: In the latest month growth continues to be driven by a broad increase in all 4 categories, with all but petrol making significant contributions in November. Petrol provided its lowest contribution to growth since November 2014, which could reflect rising petrol prices. The highest contribution to growth was non-food stores, contributing 2.1 percentage points to growth. This large increase in non-food volumes could be a result of consumers taking advantage of Black Friday deals on a number of non-food products. Here\u2019s some economist reaction: Boom! Output across the eurozone\u2019s factories has hit a 32-month high in December, according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit. But firms also report that the cost of raw materials has jumped -- factory input prices are rising at their faster rate since May 2011. Markit\u2019s overall eurozone PMI was unchanged at 53.9, which shows steady growth, as the jump in manufacturing output was balanced by a small slowdown in services. European stock markets are taking the Fed rate hike in their stride this morning - not surprising, really, as it was widely expected. The German DAX and the French CAC have risen by around 0.4%, reflecting the drop in the euro vs the US dollar (good news for exporters). And Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has dipped by 9 points, or 0.15%. Financial shares are rallying, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays both up 2.3% Eric Lonergan, macro fund manager at M&amp;G, says the market reaction has been \u201clogical\u201d. The dollar has rallied, the yield curve has flattened and the equity of the large US money centre banks, which profit most from a rising Fed funds, are out-performing a weak stock market. He argues that banks should benefit from higher interest rates: Banks may well ease lending conditions in response to higher margins, and if corporate optimism feeds through to a tighter labour market and wage increases, final demand may prove as immune to higher interest rates as it did to ever lower global policy rates in recent years Bad news from Wigan -- 100 jobs have been lost as a biscuit maker at the Northern town\u2019s goes into administration. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has the story: The maker of \u2018Pink Panther\u2019 wafers sold in British supermarkets will be the latest food producer to blame a Brexit crunch when it announces on Thursday that it has fallen into administration. Sky News understands that the owner of Rivington Biscuits\u200e, which is based in Wigan, Lancashire, will blame the post-EU referendum slump in the value of sterling for drivng up input costs in recent months. Almost 100 of the 125-strong workforce are understood to have been made redundant on Wednesday, less than a fortnight before Christmas. Newsflash from a chilly Bern: The Swiss central bank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of minus 0.75%. The SNB says the global economy has continued to recover, but threats remain -- including Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Here\u2019s a flavour: In the UK, the economic impact of the Brexit decision has so far proved less pronounced than originally feared. The SNB expects the moderate pace of global growth to continue in 2017. The baseline scenario for the world economy is still subject to considerable risks, however. Structural problems in a number of advanced economies could negatively affect the outlook. Added to this are a multitude of political uncertainties which are particularly associated with the future course of economic policy in the US, upcoming elections in several countries in the euro area as well as the complex and arduous exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. Government bonds are being pummelled in early trading - as they suffer from the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions. With prices sliding, the interest rate on UK 10-year gilts has jumped to 1.52%, up from 1.38% yesterday. That\u2019s the highest yield since May, before the Brexit vote. Other government bonds are also being hit - the yield on 10-year US Treasuries (America\u2019s debt) has jumped to 2.61%, from 2.51%. French, Italian and Spanish bonds are also weakening in value (prices fall when yields rise), as traders pull money out of bonds. With the Fed predicting faster rate hikes next year, investors are demanding a higher rate of return for holding government bonds. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: As was perhaps to be expected, markets took some umbrage at the dot plot\u2019s implication of one additional rate hike in 2017. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever shows how the US dollar has strengthened sharply over the last two years: The dollar rally has hit shares across emerging markets this morning. Traders are bracing for a surge of capital out of developing countries and back into US assets, to benefit from higher interest rates. So that\u2019s driven most Asian markets into the red: The US dollar has surged to a 14-year high against other currencies this morning, after the Federal Reserve raised American interest rates last night. In volatile trading, the dollar index (the broad measure of the currency\u2019s strength) hit its highest level since 2003. It hit a record high against the Turkish lira, an eight year high against the Chinese yuan, and a 20-month high against the euro (which has slid back to $1.0478). The surge came after the Fed predicted it would raise interest rates three times in 2017, up from the two hikes predicted in September. And with Donald Trump promising huge spending on infrastructure once he becomes president, investors are concluding that the Fed may have to tighten monetary policy faster than expected to rein in inflation. Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda in Singapore, said in a note that Fed chair Yellen has surprised the markets by not talking a softer tone. \u201cThis is flat out hawkish, and the US dollar is reacting accordingly,\u201d \u201cI thought we would be calling the Yellen bluff this morning, as the market had expected at most a subtle shift in Fed language. \u201cHowever, the Fed\u2019s forward guidance is in reaction to Trumpflation as Dr Yellen did little to quell the markets\u2019 pent up the view that both growth and inflation will accelerate in 2017.\u201d More here: However..... there are reasons to be cautious. The Fed may be expecting three rate hikes in 2017, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean it will definitely happen. Philip Shaw of Investec points out that policymakers had expected four rate hikes this year - and only delivered one, last night. (each dot shows where one Fed policymaker expects US interest rates to be) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Get out the tinsel and put on the party hats, because Britain\u2019s final central bank meeting of the year is upon us. At noon UK time, the Bank of England will announce its decision on monetary policy, as it continues its balancing act since the Brexit vote. The City expect the BoE to leave interest rates on hold today, at their current record low of 0.25%. But will it maintain its \u2018neutral bias\u2019 - meaning the next move in rates could be up or down? And will any policymakers split from the pack, or will it be a 9-nil vote? The Bank has a lot to think about right now, with inflation jumping to 1.2% in November as the weak pound drives import prices up. Yesterday\u2019s labour force data is also a concern, with employment falling for the first time since the EU referendum. So governor Mark Carney and colleagues need to tread cautiously, especially with Britain facing a \u2018lost decade\u2019: Also coming up today.... The Swiss and Norwegian central banks are also announcing their decisions on monetary policy this morning. On the economic front, we get new \u2018flash\u2019 estimates of the eurozone manufacturing and service sectors from Markit at 9am, plus US inflation and manufacturing reports this afternoon. We\u2019ll also keep tracking Greece, where relations between Athens, European officials and the International Monetary Fund are becoming more strained by the day. As we covered yesterday, Europe\u2019s bailout fund froze plans for Greek debt relief after prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced new help for poorer pensioners. Tsipras won\u2019t be cowed, though. He\u2019s asking parliament to vote on giving 1.6 million pensioners a Christmas bonus of between \u20ac300 and \u20ac800, and whether to suspend a planned increase in sales tax for Aegean islands which have been hit by the migrant crisis. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100\u2019s performance will depend on whether the rising dollar does too much to torpedo the commodity rally, or whether higher rates will lift bank stocks sufficiently in the year ahead to offset this. 15 December 2016 may well prove to be a microcosm of what 2017 has to offer.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5852c2d8e4b0010b9dd8246d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T16:21:49.342Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the US and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to climb following the Fed rate decision.</p> <p>It is now up around 154 points at 19,946 and heading towards 20,000.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5852c022e4b0525ea8568f8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T16:12:24.650Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And Moscovici has also met the head of Greece\u2019s opposition party New Democracy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/809426328973967360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good exchange of views with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmitsotakis\">@kmitsotakis</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Commission\">@EU_Commission</a> has consistently called for broad political support for necessary reforms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2zvdK1gseq\">pic.twitter.com/2zvdK1gseq</a></p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/809426328973967360\">December 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5852bfb8e4b08386c3102313\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T16:08:36.315Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece and European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/809423857035702273\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Timely meeting with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsipras_eu\">@tsipras_eu</a>  to discuss conclusion of the second review. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PbzCMGssed\">pic.twitter.com/PbzCMGssed</a></p>&mdash; Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici/status/809423857035702273\">December 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5852be8ce4b08386c3102311\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T16:03:36.802Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has regained the 7000 level for the first time since the end of October.</p> <p>Bank shares are among the leading risers after the US rate hike from the Federal Reserve, and hopes that Italian banks will be recapitalised.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T16:05:03.902Z\">at 4.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5852bb03e4b0010b9dd82458\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-15T15:54:22.182Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Positive US figures</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier there were some new US economic figures, all fairly positive in the wake of the Fed\u2019s interest rate rise and plans for another three increases next year.</p> <p>The consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire manufacturing index came in at 9 in December, well above the consensus of 4 and the November figure of 1.5.</p> <p>Jobless claims fell for the second week in a row, down 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000.

The Communications Workers Union (CWU) said the Post Office had rejected its offer to suspend strike action in exchange for suspension of the closure of main post offices and for \u201cmeaningful negotiations\u201d on pensions and jobs. Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of CWU, which acts for about 4,000 postal workers, said: \u201cOur members and this union have tried everything possible to resolve the dispute. The latest response from the Post Office is bitterly disappointing and an indication that the employer is determined on forcing through their plans irrespective of the concerns of the customers, staff and the union. \u201cThe response we have received from the public has been one of massive support for our efforts to protect this highly cherished service and we are determined to not allow it to slip from our high streets via death from a thousand cuts.\u201d The Post Office has said next week\u2019s strike will have minimal impact on Christmas mail and that less than 100 branches are likely to close, but that claim is disputed by the postal workers\u2019 unions. The government-backed post office operator has said less than 3% of its outlets will be affected by the action, expected to start from 19 December. The CWU says more than a fifth of parcels were handled by the 300 crown post offices where its members work. Kevin Gilliland, group network and sales director for the Post Office, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that, whilst we\u2019ve been holding discussions with the union throughout this week and have made it clear we remain open to further, formal talks at the most senior level, they are continuing to cause concern to customers during the festive season. \u201cIt will be business as usual in almost all of our network, with over 50,000 Post Office people on hand to support customers as they make their preparations for Christmas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its \u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of Sky, as minority shareholders call for transparency on how the pay-TV company\u2019s independent directors came to accept the offer. Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than \u00a318bn and which would give him control of pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and the radio group TalkSport. Fox has not raised the initial \u00a310.75 per share offer it tabled on Friday. A number of shareholders and City analysts have accused Sky of selling on the cheap, pointing out that the company\u2019s shares were at the offer level as recently as February. A committee of Sky\u2019s independent directors, led by Martin Gilbert \u2013 the broadcaster\u2019s deputy chairman and the chief executive of Sky shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 scrutinised the deal on behalf of non-Murdoch investors. The committee, which unanimously accepted the deal, included the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and the finance chief, Andrew Griffith, who are in line for a \u00a340m payday if the deal goes through. \u201cWe would urge the independent committee of Sky directors, who recommended that shareholders accept the offer, to share more information on the independent financial advice that they based their agreement on,\u201d said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which controls \u00a362m of Sky shares. \u201cSuch disclosure would help shareholders assess the fairness of the offer and give greater confidence in the independence of the committee in the bid process.\u201d Other shareholders to have expressed concern over the terms of the deal include Standard Life, Jupiter Asset Management and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, which has called for \u201crobust\u201d safeguards to protect Sky\u2019s \u201cfuture probity\u201d under full ownership by Murdoch. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide whether the deal raises public interest concerns, specifically relating to media plurality. Bradley is likely to ask regulator Ofcom to launch an investigation to determine whether Murdoch will have too much control over news media in the UK. Ofcom will have up to 40 working days to file its public interest report on the deal, assuming Bradley asks the media regulator to investigate. Lachlan Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, said: \u201cWe are excited to bring Sky fully into 21st Century Fox. Partial ownership of Sky was not natural end state for us. Fully combining the businesses is a clear logical next step of portfolio evolution. \u201cIt adds the strength of the Sky brand to our portfolio including Fox, National Geographic and Star brands. Considering the complete set of options in respect of capital allocation, this transaction provides the most attractive returns of for 21st Century Fox shareholders.\u201d Fox has said that if the deal is not done by the end of next year it will pay shareholders a sweetener of a 10p special dividend, which will equate to about \u00a3172m. However, Fox has said shareholders will not receive any dividend payments next year. Previously, Sky\u2019s 10.75p per share offer was due to be reduced by taking off shareholder dividend payments next year. Fox has said that if the deal falls through it will pay a \u00a3200m break fee. In 2011, News Corporation paid a break fee of about \u00a338.5m after pulling out of its bid as the phone-hacking scandal engulfed Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said the government should refer the deal to regulators. \u201cThis bid was abandoned in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, and now it\u2019s back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe secretary of state must refer the bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it would result in too much media power being concentrated in too few hands, and whether Rupert and James Murdoch are fit and proper persons to run a broadcaster. \u201cThe government cannot be allowed to ditch the vital second part of the Leveson inquiry, which would look at questions around unlawful or improper conduct within the Murdoch empire, at exactly the moment when Rupert Murdoch is attempting once again to strengthen his hold over the UK media.\u201d The campaign group Hacked Off has launched a petition to lobby Bradley to refer the deal to regulators. The petition cites issues including the scathing findings of Ofcom\u2019s investigation into James Murdoch\u2019s conduct as chief executive of the publisher of the now defunct News of the World at the time of the phone-hacking scandal. James Murdoch, now chief executive of 21st Century Fox and chairman of Sky, said he believed the deal \u201cpasses regulatory muster\u201d in both Europe and the UK. \u201cThere are various bits and pieces to the European [regulatory] timeline and if necessary the UK timeline with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Ofcom having to make a number of decisions in the next little while,\u201d he said. In 2011, Rupert Murdoch was forced to agree to spin off Sky News into a separate company in order to quell media plurality issues because of his ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun newspapers. \u201cWe will be engaging with the relevant authorities right away,\u201d James Murdoch said. \u201cWe do think that this passes regulatory muster, and we think as the relevant authorities look at the facts set around both the competition and potential UK intervention issues, that no meaningful concessions will need to be made.\u201d The company moved to try to allay fears that Sky News might be \u201cFoxified\u201d into a version of the rightwing Fox News. \u201c21st Century Fox will continue to broadcast news under the Sky brand, maintaining its excellent record of compliance with the Ofcom broadcasting code,\u201d the company said. Fox and Sky are aiming to push through a form of takeover that will make it easier to squeeze out shareholders opposed to the deal. The so-called \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d, a court-backed process, requires approval from 75% of non-Fox shareholders. If this level is reached then all investors are forced to sell their stakes. It is understood that a significant number of shareholders will reject the implementation of the scheme when Sky holds a vote at a yet-to-be-scheduled extraordinary general meeting. Fox, which controls 37.19% of voteable shares, is not allowed to vote. This means that independent investors accounting for almost 16% of total Sky shares will need to vote against the scheme to block it being implemented.",

      "bodyText": "Heineken has given the UK economy a vote of confidence following the EU referendum by agreeing to buy almost 2,000 British pubs. The Dutch company and the investment firm Patron Capital have won a \u00a3400m battle to take over Punch Taverns, which has more than 3,000 pubs across the UK. Heineken and Patron, whose bid vehicle is called Vine Acquisitions, have agreed a deal with the board of Punch to buy the company for 180p per share, or \u00a3403m. The companies will split the pubs between them. The UK boss of Heineken described the deal as a \u201chuge vote of confidence in the \u2018Great British pub\u2019\u201d. The commitment to the UK from Heineken comes after Nissan, Apple and Google also pledged to invest in the country despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Under the terms of the proposal, Heineken will buy a portfolio of about 1,900 pubs from Vine, which is controlled by Patron, on completion of the deal. This would leave Patron with the remainder. Heineken will pay \u00a3305m for the pubs. David Forde, the managing director of Heineken UK, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a huge vote of confidence in the \u2018Great British pub\u2019. Our proven track record of success demonstrates that well-invested and well-run pubs in the leased and tenanted sector can thrive. \u201cToday\u2019s development is good news for pubgoers across the UK who will see the benefit of better pubs in their communities. We look forward to welcoming new licensees into Star Pubs &amp; Bars, and to working with them to grow their businesses.\u201d Vine has seen off competition from Alan McIntosh, one of the founders of Punch, who approached the pub company about a deal worth 185p a share, although this was conditional on securing funding. The offer from Vine has been recommended by the board of Punch and is also being supported by its biggest shareholders \u2013 Glenview Capital, Avenue Capital and Warwick Capital. This means that shareholders representing 52.3% of Punch, including the directors, are backing the deal. Stephen Billingham, the chairman of Punch, said the company did not solicit this offer but that it was a \u201cgood outcome for shareholders as the offer provides cash certainty at a significant premium\u201d. The offer of 180p per share is 40% higher than Punch\u2019s closing share price on 13 December, the day before the bid emerged. Shares in Punch jumped 8% to 191p, suggesting some traders in the market think the bid battle may not be over.",

That, bluntly, was the message from the Bank of England as it announced its latest decision on borrowing costs less than 24 hours after the US Federal Reserve not only tightened policy but signalled more to come in 2017. As far as central banks go, the Fed is an outlier. Growth and inflation are both picking up and the US president-elect, Donald Trump, is planning tax cuts and extra spending on infrastructure. The normal rule of thumb is that looser fiscal policy should be offset by tighter monetary policy, hence the suggestion there could be three interest-rate rises in the US next year. Elsewhere, though, it is a different story. The European Central Bank has recently announced an extension of its quantitative easing programme and the Bank of Japan is working overtime to keep deflation at bay. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee say the next move in UK interest rates could be either up or down, depending on how the economy evolves over the coming months. Threadneedle Street has been pleasantly surprised by how well growth has held up since the EU referendum. On its own, that would suggest the MPC should be thinking about following the Fed\u2019s lead and raising rates. But the Bank of England suspects that the good news is not going to last. It wonders how long consumers will continue to spend so freely once rising inflation starts to affect living standards. It thinks the unexpected increase in investment in the third quarter was a flash in the pan. If the outlook is for markedly weaker growth in 2017, that would point to further stimulus from the Bank, either through a cut in interest rates to 0.1% or by an extension of its QE programme. There are two added complications. The first is that the Bank knows inflation is going to breach its 2% target next year but it doesn\u2019t know by how much, or whether rising prices will feed through into higher wage settlements. The second unknown is the impact on the economy of triggering article 50 in early 2017, the moment at which formal divorce proceedings start between the UK and the other 27 members of the EU. What does all that mean? It means interest rates are likely to stay where they are in 2017. If they do move, they will move downwards.",

    "webTitle": "Fortnum & Mason aims to cut basic pay for more staff in bid to reduce tax bill", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Queen\u2019s grocer Fortnum &amp; Mason is trying to persuade more of its staff to accept a big cut in basic pay in return for a share of tips in a move that will help reduce its tax bill. The retailer, which recently announced a 27% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a36.2m in the year to July, currently does not share with staff any of the 12.5% service charge automatically added to bills paid by drinkers at its Heathrow bar. Fortnum\u2019s is now consulting with the 20 bar staff on introducing a so-called \u201ctronc\u201d system under which the charge would be shared out among them \u2013 but only if they agree to take a cut in basic pay. The plans prompted protests on Thursday outside Fortnum\u2019s flagship store in London, which holds two royal warrants. An illustration of the changes sent to a staff member and passed to the Guardian indicates they would receive a near 11% cut in basic pay, taking them down to the national minimum wage of \u00a37.20 an hour, which would then be replaced by a minimum share from the service charge. However, the letter does not make clear what proportion of the total service charge paid voluntarily by customers would be allotted to the workers, Fortnum\u2019s or a company called WMT Troncmaster Services that will run the tronc system. It also makes clear that the illustrated payments are not guaranteed. The letter points out that under the new system the employees would be liable for lower national insurance payments, helping to boost their take-home pay. But the changes would also mean a cut in the tax bill in employer\u2019s national insurance for Fortnum &amp; Mason, owned by an arm of the Weston family, which also owns a large stake in Associated British Foods, the owner of Primark. The same changes were made to nearly all the 250 staff working at Fortnum &amp; Mason\u2019s restaurants, cafe and bar in London last year. Unite, which has been involved in a long-running campaign against unfair handling of service charges and tips, said the new system was \u201cshrouded in secrecy\u201d and staff who signed up would be swapping guaranteed pay for an unknown amount of tips. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said: \u201cFortnum &amp; Mason bosses are treating its loyal and hardworking staff with utter contempt. It needs to start operating a fair, clear and transparent policy to show how it distributes its service charge or risk alienating staff and customers alike. \u201cWe believe that diners will be outraged to learn that the 12.5% service charge they have just paid is being controlled entirely by an outside consultant without any input from staff or clear information on how much of the fee it is pocketing for itself. \u201cSuch underhand practices, which remain rife in the industry, highlight why the current business secretary needs to deliver on the government\u2019s promise to crack down on dubious tipping practices.\u201d Matthew Brown, technical officer for the employment taxes subcommittee at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said payments via a tronc system operated completely separately from the employer were not liable for national insurance. But he said that, as service charges are usually set and controlled by the employer it might be difficult for them to prove they had no involvement in the scheme\u2019s operation. WMT Troncmaster says on its website that one of the main advantages of a tronc system is that it could save a company and its staff a combined 26% in \u201cunnecessary taxes\u201d. It suggests a business with a turnover of \u00a3250,000 a year could save \u00a34,000 a year. It adds that a \u201cboutique London hotel\u201d it worked with, which was generating between \u00a38,000 and \u00a310,000 a month in service charges and tips paid on cards, had saved \u00a316,500 in employer\u2019s national insurance. \u201cThere are a lot of savings to be made if this can be done right. I would be surprised if this wasn\u2019t challenged by HMRC,\u201d Brown said. WMT Troncmaster\u2019s website warns clients that HMRC might check that a tronc arrangement \u201cfully meets the terms for exemption from [national insurance contributions].\u201d However, the advisory company says that it designs and runs tronc schemes to safeguard businesses and \u201csuccessfully defends businesses challenged by HMRC.\u201d He added that by reducing the amount of basic pay, any employers involved in such a scheme would also be reducing the potential liabilities for pension payments under auto-enrolment, which are based on basic pay and would not include tips. Fortnums began consulting with staff at Heathrow just weeks after a government report said charges imposed on staff tips by employers should be scrapped or limited. The report, which followed an eight-month investigation into abuse of tipping kicked off by former business secretary Sajid Javid, also advised that service charges on customers\u2019 bills should also be clear and voluntary. A public consultation on measures to ensure staff got a bigger share of tips finished in the summer and responses are expected to be published by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department early next year. A spokesman for Fortnum &amp; Mason said: \u201cIn July 2015, we consulted with staff and implemented a new, dynamic and fair tronc system. Nothing was imposed: staff were given a proposal to consider on an individual basis, and of our 250 hospitality staff, only one opted out, who remains with the company. The devising and administration of a tronc system is by its very nature complicated, and to ensure operation within both the letter and spirit of the law, Fortnum\u2019s engaged a respected independent company, WMT Troncmaster Services, who continue to manage the arrangements. \u201cSince the new tronc system, which is in line with industry standards, came into being, Fortnum\u2019s has not had a single complaint from staff. \u201cThe 20 hospitality staff at the company\u2019s outlet at Heathrow T5 were not included in the 2015 consultation because it was a new site without an established trading record. The company has commenced a consultation with the hospitality staff at T5. This is ongoing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has left interest rates at their record low of 0.25% but repeated a warning that higher inflation and slower wage growth risk squeezing household budgets and spending next year. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep rates on hold and maintain the current programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. Policymakers had cut rates and expanded QE back in August to shore up confidence in the wake of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. In minutes to its final meeting of the year, the MPC said it would continue to trade off the effects of a weaker pound raising inflation against the prospects of economic growth and employment slowing. For now, policymakers said they saw no need to change policy as little had appeared to change since the MPC published its forecasts for the economy in November\u2019s inflation report. \u201cA slowdown in growth remained likely, but there had been little news since the time of the November inflation report about domestic activity and, although the near-term global outlook had improved, this was counterbalanced by more elevated risks,\u201d the minutes said. The pound fell after the minutes said inflation may not rise as quickly as it expected in the near-term. \u201cSince the Committee\u2019s previous meeting, sterling\u2019s trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated by over 6%, while dollar oil prices have risen by 14%. All else equal, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than envisaged in the November inflation report, though it is still likely to overshoot the target later in 2017 and through 2018,\u201d the minutes said. The minutes also highlighted a \u201cnotable decline in consumer confidence\u201d and signs of businesses being nervous about the longer-term. They repeated a forecast for unemployment to rise next year and for inflation to overtake pay growth \u201cmarginally\u201d in 2017. There were early warning signs on Thursday that higher prices are forcing some people to cut back. Official figures showed retail sales continued to grow in November but at a markedly slower pace as fuel sales slowed amid higher pump prices. The MPC also reiterated its previous stance that it was ready to make monetary policy tighter or looser depending on how the economy evolves as the Brexit process gets under way. \u201cMonetary policy could respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfolded to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said the minutes\u2019 reiteration that the Bank was ready to move in either direction reflected \u201cgreat uncertainty ahead\u201d and he expected the MPC to continue to hold borrowing costs for many months to come, rather than reacting to higher inflation with a rate rise. \u201cGrowth is expected to slow and the MPC\u2019s base case remains that higher inflation will not become embedded into wages and inflation expectations - some measures of which have risen, they noted - so the Bank can continue to look through the inflation spike. We think Bank Rate will be on hold throughout 2017.\u201d Inflation picked up last month but was still well below the target at 1.2%. Because inflation was more than a percentage point off target at 0.9% in October, the Bank\u2019s governor had to write an open letter to chancellor Philip Hammond. His exchange of letters with Hammond was published alongside Thursday\u2019s minutes. Carney told the chancellor inflation would soon pick up on higher import costs. City economists had not expected a move in either direction on interest rates after a series of speeches from policymakers had suggested they will be in wait-and-see mode on the economy for some time to come, weighing up signs of rising inflation against indications that business confidence has faltered. The Bank is forecasting a slowdown in economic growth next year and a pick up in inflation, as the pound\u2019s weakness since the referendum raises the cost of imports to the UK. The Bank\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold follows the move by its US counterpart the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to raise interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. The Fed\u2019s main interest rate is now a range of 0.50-0.75%. Referring to the prospect of higher government spending in the US under president-elect Donald Trump, the Bank\u2019s minutes said there could be ripple effects for the rest of the global economy. \u201cSince November, long-term interest rates have risen internationally, including in the United Kingdom. In part, this reflects expectations of looser fiscal policy in the United States which, if it materialises, will help to underpin the slightly greater momentum in the global economy evident in a range of data since the summer.\u201d But it added a note of caution amid greater uncertainty around the world. \u201cAt the same time, however, the global outlook has become more fragile, with risks in China, the euro area and some emerging markets, and an increase in policy uncertainty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bumper sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday helped the retail sector to maintain strong growth in November and bolstered hopes of a busy Christmas on the high street. Department stores and electrical goods sellers were the biggest beneficiaries as consumers sought out deals on the latest TVs and phones. The Office for National Statistics said sales increased by 0.5% excluding fuel in November from October and by 5.9% on the same month last year. The only blot on the generally upbeat picture was fuel sales after a spike in pump prices put an end to 18 months of low driving costs. To emphasise the squeeze on drivers, the ONS said fuel prices increased at the fastest rate since 2011 to push sales to their lowest level of annual growth for two years. Some analysts said the rising cost of imports, including fuel, would combine with low wage growth to take the steam out of sales. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cA substantial correction is coming. Next year will be very different.\u201d Inflation jumped to 1.2% in November as the 15% fall in sterling since June forced firms to begin nudging prices higher. Tombs said: \u201cThe squeeze on real incomes from higher inflation and slower employment growth will push the rate of growth of retail sales down sharply. For now, though, consumers\u2019 spending continues to drive economic growth.\u201d Chris Williamson said it was understandable that retailers would feel buoyant after they enjoyed the strongest three-month spell of growth for almost two years in the third quarter, but figures for October and November showed \u201ccracks may be appearing in the willingness of consumers to keep spending in the face of rising prices and wider financial worries\u201d. \u201cThe concern is that we may be starting to see signs that rising inflation, weak pay growth and job insecurity among households are all starting to subdue consumer spending,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial worries rose especially sharply among households where the main earner is employed in the private sector, with government workers perhaps feeling more secure in their jobs due to recent suggestions that government spending may soon start to rise as austerity is reined back. Private sector employees\u2019 view on their future finances fell to the lowest for three years in October, boding ill for retail sales at the start of the fourth quarter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The loss-making company behind Pink Panther wafers has gone into administration, with the loss of about 100 jobs, after taking a hit from the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Rivington Biscuits, which is based in Wigan, Lancashire, was already in the red but its financial position worsened after the June referendum, as the sharp fall in sterling pushed up the cost of ingredients used to make its biscuits. As a small firm it was unable to pass the price rises on to its supermarket customers and its losses escalated to several hundred thousand pounds a month. This prompted Rivington\u2019s Dutch owner Van Delft to appoint FRP Advisory as administrators on Tuesday night. Staff were told they had been made redundant on Wednesday. The vast majority of the workforce, 99 people, have left while 24 people have been kept on to help fulfil existing contracts with supermarkets. However, their future is uncertain while FRP, which is also handling the liquidation of collapsed department store chain BHS, tries to find a buyer for the business. Rivington is a key employer in Wigan, which voted 63.9% to leave the EU in June. Half of those who have lost their jobs at Rivington have already put in their claims and hope to get their redundancy cheques by Christmas. Apart from Pink Panthers, Rivington also makes own-brand biscuits for supermarkets including Lidl. Van Delft has invested \u00a37m in its factory in Wigan since buying the business in 2009, but has been unable to turn it around. Larger food suppliers have more clout. Unilever, the consumer goods giant whose brands range from Marmite to Persil, became embroiled in a public spat with Tesco last month after hiking the prices it charges supermarkets. The price of a basket of 20 Unilever products has gone up by an average of 5.7% since the Brexit vote, according to analysis by the Guardian and price comparison site MySupermarket.com published last month.",

The news has pushed the dollar higher, and in turn hit commodity prices and dragged the mining heavy FTSE 100 18.15 points lower to 6931.04. European markets, less dominated by commodities, are managing to cling on to their slight gains. Among the biggest fallers in the UK are Antofagasta, down 25.5p at 695.5p, and BHP Billiton, 40p lower at 1315.5p. With gold and silver also falling, precious metal miner Fresnillo has dropped 112p to \u00a310.68 and Randgold Resources is 415p down at \u00a355.25. But Centrica has climbed 7.5p to 226.4p after the British Gas owner raised its full year guidance on cost cutting and a strong trading performance. The news comes as energy companies continue to be accused accused of profiteering and face government calls to treat customers better. Lower down the market Just Eat has jumped 17p to 614.5p after the online takeaway specialist announced two acquisitions. It is paying an initial \u00a3200m with another potential \u00a340m to buy UK rival Hungry House from Delivery Hero, a Berlin company backed by Rocket Internet. Analysts said the Competition and Markets Authority was likely to look at the deal. It is also buying Canada\u2019s SkipTheDishes for an initial \u00a366m, with another \u00a354m payable subject to performance. It said Hungry House would boost earnings per share in the first year, but SkipTheDishes would weigh on earnings in 2017 and 2018. Canaccord Genuity analysts said: Just Eat is a highly cash generative business, with a clear strategy of using M&amp;A to expand market share in its existing territories. Today\u2019s acquisitions... both look to be broadly sensible deals which should help shore up market share in two of Just Eat\u2019s key territories, helping to drive economies of scale and strengthening the group\u2019s presence here. It\u2019s consistent with management\u2019s strategy, and looks like it will be largely funded from internal resources, so at first glance a positive development for the business. Elsewhere temporary power supply company Aggreko has added 26.5p to 903p after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy and raised its target price from 780p to \u00a310. The bank said: From 2012A-16E, we estimate that Aggreko\u2019s trading profit will have declined by almost 40%. This has been largely driven by (i) the roll-off of certain one-off contracts (Japan/US military, London Olympics), (ii) pricing pressure and (iii) a drag from oil and gas. While risks still remain for 2017E, mainly with the well flagged contract renewals in Argentina, we expect an inflection in earnings momentum in 2018E. We see upside with a return to earnings growth.",

      "bodyText": "British Gas owner Centrica has upgraded its profit outlook after cost cuts and strong trading, a day after it emerged that three-quarters of its customers are on expensive variable tariffs. Despite volatile energy markets, Centrica now expects adjusted earnings per share of 16.5p this year and adjusted operating cashflow of \u00a32.4bn to \u00a32.6bn, up from a previous estimate of more than \u00a32bn. Its shares were the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index, gaining almost 3% to 225p. An energy league table published by the watchdog Ofgem on Wednesday showed that 74% of British Gas customers (6.6 million people) are on standard variable tariffs, and pay an average annual bill of \u00a31,044. This is \u00a3129 more expensive than the company\u2019s cheapest tariff. British Gas, Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier, recently said it would freeze prices until March but consumer organisations said this was not enough and warned that price rises of up to 10% were likely after the end of the winter. Energy companies have repeatedly been accused of profiteering and are under growing pressure from the government to treat their loyal customers better. Centrica has slashed more than 3,000 jobs in an attempt to save \u00a3750m a year. More than \u00a3300m of that has already been achieved and operating costs are expected to be lower this year than in 2015. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur performance in the second half of the year has been strong and we expect to exceed our 2016 targets. We have made considerable progress in reshaping our portfolio and capabilities to deliver a robust platform for customer-focused growth. The Centrica team has performed very well in extremely difficult circumstances.\u201d Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cIts upbeat trading statement today shows UK home energy accounts are virtually unchanged since the half-year update. That marks a fairly important milestone after it lost 400,000 customers in the first half \u2013 3% of its base. Improvements in customer service seem to be paying off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "JD Sports is to launch an investigation into conditions at its Kingsway warehouse near Rochdale after a Channel 4 documentary found workers claiming it was \u201cworse than a prison\u201d. The retailer denied the claims, saying in a stock exchange statement it was \u201cdeeply disappointed and concerned by the footage broadcast by Channel 4\u201d. \u201cWhilst we do not believe it to be an accurate reflection of our culture, the vast majority of our people or our standards of practice and procedures, we will be launching an investigation into the implementation of our policies at our Kingsway facility,\u201d it added. \u201cWhile we maintain that the policies and procedures in place are robust and fair, it is clear that we need to do better in their implementation. In the short term, we intend to retrain all supervisory and security employees at the facility, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that those policies are correctly reflected across the workplace.\u201d A five-week undercover investigation by Channel 4, broadcast on Wednesday night, claimed there were harsh practices at the warehouse, including a \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy, intense surveillance and heightened job insecurity among agency workers. About 1,500 people work at the distribution centre, including hundreds of agency staff, while others are directly employed by JD Sports. The investigation comes a year after Guardian undercover reporters found that rival Sports Direct paid warehouse workers at Shirebrook less than the minimum wage and operated punitive disciplinary procedures, such as a six-strikes policy. The Channel 4 investigation into JB included video footage apparently showing a team leader at the warehouse saying to an undercover reporter: \u201cNo sitting down, no, you get fired. I\u2019ve sacked people for sitting down.\u201d One worker said in the film: \u201cIt\u2019s more worse than a prison. Prisons get more frigging respect.\u201d JD Sports denied the claims, saying it did not operate a \u201cstrike\u201d policy and workers could not be fired on the spot. After watching the footage, Iain Wright MP, chair of the Commons business, energy and industrial energy committee, said workers were \u201ctreated like scum\u201d. He said the alleged three-strikes policy was \u201ctwice as bad as what we found at Sports Direct\u201d. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said it was \u201cincreasingly clear that Sports Direct wasn\u2019t just one bad apple, and that terrible working practices are taking place across the UK. \u201cThe government needs to look seriously at how this sort of behaviour continues to take place in today\u2019s Britain.\u201d JD Sports reported record first-half profits of \u00a377.4m in September, up 66%, while Sports Direct\u2019s profits fell 57% to \u00a371.6m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospect of three more hikes in US interest rates next year has sent the dollar to a 14-year high and caused a selloff on most Asian markets. The US Federal Reserve increased rates as expected on Wednesday by a quarter of a point, only the second time it has done so since 2008. But investors were caught out by surprisingly bullish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen in the wake of the announcement and by projections showing that 11 of her 17 policy-making colleagues see borrowing costs rising another three times in 2017. The news sent the dollar index with other currencies soaring to 102.62, its highest point since 2003. The euro was down 0.2% at $1.0512 after sliding to $1.0468, a trough not seen in 21 months. The pound dipped nearly US2c to $1.255. In Asian trading the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars all suffered losses, as well as the Mexican peso. China\u2019s yuan fell to its weakest level against the dollar in more than eight years as it crept higher towards the seven yuan to one dollar mark. Traders told Reuters that China\u2019s big state-owned banks were intervening heavily in the market to prevent the yuan falling too far from the central bank\u2019s daily fix of 6.9289 yuan per dollar. The Fed stance came as US president-elect Donald Trump has promised to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. \u201cThis is flat out hawkish, and the US dollar is reacting accordingly,\u201d Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda in Singapore, said in a note. \u201cI thought we would be calling the Yellen bluff this morning, as the market had expected at most a subtle shift in Fed language. \u201cHowever, the Fed\u2019s forward guidance is in reaction to Trumpflation as Dr Yellen did little to quell the markets\u2019 pent up the view that both growth and inflation will accelerate in 2017.\u201d \u201cThe rate hike projections for 2017 being increased to three shows that Fed\u2019s board is having to factor in the impact of Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. The greenback pushed towards 118 yen in Asia, helping to push the Nikkei average of leading shares higher, in contrast to other bourses in the region as traders worried about a flood of cash out of their own economies to higher yields in the US. Hong Kong shares sank 1.2% and Shanghai lost 0.9% while Sydney was off 0.8%, Seoul shed 0.4%. Shares in London and Frankfurt were expected to be down slightly when trading opened later on Thursday, according to trading group IG. In her post-announcement conference, Yellen said: \u201cIt\u2019s important for households and businesses to understand that my colleagues and I have judged the course of the US economy to be strong. \u201cWe have a strong labor market and we have a resilient economy.\u201d Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader, said: \u201cThis is a big event... the Fed has straight-batted it but is hiking and signalling more than the market expected just on current economic settings.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "James Packer retreats from China with sell-off of Crown's overseas casinos", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The casino magnate James Packer has scaled back the international ambitions of his gambling empire in a dramatic strategy shift that will see him concentrate on his Australian business. Crown Resorts, which is controlled by Packer, announced on Thursday that it has dumped plans to spin off his international assets and has halved his stake in the venture\u2019s troublesome Chinese business. Crown, which is still dealing with the arrests of senior employees in China in October, said it had agreed to sell almost half its 27% stake in Melco Crown Entertainment for $1.6bn to Packer\u2019s Hong Kong-based partner, Lawrence Ho. And in a signal of complete retreat from the once-booming Macao business, Crown said it was \u201cexploring potential options\u201d to offload the remainder of its stake in Melco Crown. It also revealed it would not proceed \u201cat this time\u201d with its huge $2bn Alon casino development project in Las Vegas and abandoned a plan \u2013 announced only in June \u2013 to separate its international assets from its Australian casinos. \u201cThe board\u2019s decision represents a prudent alternative to the proposed demerger,\u201d Crown chief executive Rowen Craigie said in a statement. The change of strategy and retreat from China means Crown will become almost entirely focused on Australia where Packer has punted billions on the success of his luxury casino and hotel development at Barangaroo in Sydney. But with the controversial waterfront scheme built on attracting ultra-wealthy gamblers from China, questions remain as to whether it can avoid the same problems as the Macau business, which has been hit by Beijing\u2019s crackdown on high rollers. A first-half trading update released by Crown on Thursday showed a 45% drop in turnover from high-roller gambling at its Australian casinos over the 23-week period, compared with a year earlier. The company said that extremely strong VIP gambling activity in the same period last year had skewed the results. However, half the profit from the sale of the Macau assets will be used to pay off $800m in debt and underpin the Barangaroo project. The other half will be returned to shareholders via share buybacks and a special dividend. \u201cThis is all about risk management,\u201d said Theo Maas, at Sydney-based Arnhem Investment Management. \u201cYou\u2019re now looking at a much more predictable business with a much stronger balance sheet.\u201d Packer, who once pinned his hopes for expansion on Macau, will resign as deputy chair and non-executive director of Melco Crown Entertainment as Ho takes over the reins. Under the Melco share sale, Crown will be left with a 14% stake in Melco Crown, with the Australian company saying it is now exploring options to \u201cmonetise\u201d part of the shareholding but stating there was no offer of any sale of shares. Crown also said it was continuing to prepare for a proposed share market float of a 49% stake in some of its Australian hotels and associated retail property. \u201cThese business decisions are strategic and for the long-term and will underpin the company\u2019s future over the next decade,\u201d Crown Resorts chairman Robert Rankin said. Crown shares went into a trading halt ahead of the announcement. They last traded at $11.37.",

      "bodyText": "Environmentalists have criticised the offshore oil regulator for appointing a recent head of the Australian arm of a major oil company to a senior position, saying the move is \u201clike putting the fox in charge of the henhouse\u201d. Derrick O\u2019Keeffe spent the past four years as country manager in Australia for Murphy Oil, which under his watch entered into a joint-venture with Santos to explore for oil in the Great Australian Bight. This week the National offshore petroleum safety and environmental management authority (Nopsema) announced he had been appointed to the position of Head of Division, Safety and Integrity, which reports directly to the chief executive. The role includes the assessment of safety cases and well operations management plans, such as those that Nopsema controversially approved for BP to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s LinkedIn profile boasts of expanding Murphy Oil\u2019s number of offshore oil permits from three to 10. Murphy Oil has had its environmental plans approved by Nopsema to explore for oil in the Great Australian Bight, and is expected to submit drilling safety cases and well operation management plans to Nopsema in the near future, which would now be assessed by O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cWhen the company he worked for has an active permit, putting an oil advocate in charge of regulating oil spill risk is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d said Greenpeace campaigner Jonathan Moylan. \u201cThe revolving door syndrome that tarnishes Australian fossil fuel politics has undermined public trust and continues to hold back energy and environment policy,\u201d said Moylan. \u201cIt is disturbing that the person responsible for safety and integrity of offshore drilling has a career primarily focussed on increasing oil production, rather than process safety.\u201d Nopsema recently rejected a freedom of information request by Greenpeace for BP\u2019s well operation management plan, which Nopsema approved, for its now-abandoned plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight. One of the reasons Nopsema gave was that the documents might be used by groups opposed to the drilling activity. \u201cNopsema has already shown it is willing to put oil companies\u2019 business interests before the public interest, and this move will cement that reputation,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cAfter the controversy over the lack of transparency surrounding BP\u2019s failed Great Australian Bight approval process, you\u2019d expect Nopsema to make an effort to win back public confidence. Instead they appear to be digging a deeper hole,\u201d said Moylan. O\u2019Keeffe also headed an oil spill safety exercise in 2015, simulating a spill similar to that seen in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. A spokeswoman for Nopsema said: \u201cMr O\u2019Keefe has actively advocated for enhancements to the industry, primarily to the health, safety and environment field.\u201d \u201cMr O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s extensive Australian and international experience in the offshore oil and gas industry, throughout the last three decades, ensures he has a well-developed appreciation of the challenging environment in which the offshore workforce operates, and the well integrity matters that must be addressed by industry. \u201cMr O\u2019Keeffe possesses a comprehensive understanding of Australia\u2019s objective-based regulatory regime, having worked for a diverse range of oil and gas companies in Australia. These include Murphy Oil (country manager), Strike Energy (chief operating officer), and Woodside (business manager). A recent example of Mr O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s expertise in this field was his success rolling out global safety standards at Murphy Oil.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe declined to comment, referring inquiries to Nopsema.",
